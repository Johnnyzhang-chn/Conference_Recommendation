1,acl,2020,2kenize: Tying Subword Sequences for Chinese Script Conversion,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.648,"Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese character conversion is a common preprocessing step in Chinese NLP. Despite this, current approaches have poor performance because they do not take into account that a simplified Chinese character can correspond to multiple traditional characters. Here, we propose a model that can disambiguate between mappings and convert between the two scripts. The model is based on subword segmentation, two language models, as well as a method for mapping between subword sequences. We further construct benchmark datasets for topic classification and script conversion. Our proposed method outperforms previous Chinese Character conversion approaches by 6 points in accuracy. These results are further confirmed in a downstream application, where 2kenize is used to convert pretraining dataset for topic classification. An error analysis reveals that our method's particular strengths are in dealing with code-mixing and named entities."
2,acl,2020,The Sensitivity of Language Models and Humans to Winograd Schema Perturbations,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.679,"Large-scale pretrained language models are the major driving force behind recent improvements in performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge, a widely employed test of common sense reasoning ability. We show, however, with a new diagnostic dataset, that these models are sensitive to linguistic perturbations of the Winograd examples that minimally affect human understanding. Our results highlight interesting differences between humans and language models: language models are more sensitive to number or gender alternations and synonym replacements than humans, and humans are more stable and consistent in their predictions, maintain a much higher absolute performance, and perform better on non-associative instances than associative ones. Overall, humans are correct more often than out-of-the-box models, and the models are sometimes right for the wrong reasons. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on a large, task-specific dataset can offer a solution to these issues."
3,acl,2020,Quantifying Attention Flow in Transformers,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.385,"In the Transformer model, ""self-attention"" combines information from attended embeddings into the representation of the focal embedding in the next layer. Thus, across layers of the Transformer, information originating from different tokens gets increasingly mixed. This makes attention weights unreliable as explanations probes. In this paper, we consider the problem of quantifying this flow of information through self-attention. We propose two methods for approximating the attention to input tokens given attention weights, attention rollout and attention flow, as post hoc methods when we use attention weights as the relative relevance of the input tokens. We show that these methods give complementary views on the flow of information, and compared to raw attention, both yield higher correlations with importance scores of input tokens obtained using an ablation method and input gradients."
4,acl,2020,History for Visual Dialog: Do we really need it?,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.728,"Energetic electrons accelerated by solar flares often give rise to type III radio bursts at a broad waveband and even interplanetary type III bursts (IT3) if the wavelength extends to decameter-kilometer. In this Letter, we investigate the probability of the flares that produce IT3, based on the sample of 2272 flares above M-class observed from 1996 to 2016. It is found that only 49.6% of the flares are detected to be accompanied with IT3. The duration, peak flux, and fluence of the flares with and without IT3 both present power-law distributions in the frequency domain, but the corresponding spectral indices for the former (2.06$\pm$0.17, 2.04$\pm$0.18, and 1.55$\pm$0.09) are obviously smaller than that for the latter (2.82$\pm$0.22, 2.51$\pm$0.19, and 2.40$\pm$0.09), showing that the flares with IT3 have longer durations and higher peak fluxes. We further examine the relevance of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to the two groups of flares. It is found that 58% (655 of 1127) of the flares with IT3 but only 19% (200 of 1078) of the flares without IT3 are associated with CMEs, and that the associated CMEs for the flares with IT3 are inclined to be wider and faster. This indicates that CMEs may also play a role in producing IT3, speculatively facilitating the escape of accelerated electrons from the low corona to the interplanetary space."
5,acl,2020,From English to Code-Switching: Transfer Learning with Strong Morphological Clues,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.716,"Linguistic Code-switching (CS) is still an understudied phenomenon in natural language processing. The NLP community has mostly focused on monolingual and multi-lingual scenarios, but little attention has been given to CS in particular. This is partly because of the lack of resources and annotated data, despite its increasing occurrence in social media platforms. In this paper, we aim at adapting monolingual models to code-switched text in various tasks. Specifically, we transfer English knowledge from a pre-trained ELMo model to different code-switched language pairs (i.e., Nepali-English, Spanish-English, and Hindi-English) using the task of language identification. Our method, CS-ELMo, is an extension of ELMo with a simple yet effective position-aware attention mechanism inside its character convolutions. We show the effectiveness of this transfer learning step by outperforming multilingual BERT and homologous CS-unaware ELMo models and establishing a new state of the art in CS tasks, such as NER and POS tagging. Our technique can be expanded to more English-paired code-switched languages, providing more resources to the CS community."
6,acl,2020,Unsupervised Domain Clusters in Pretrained Language Models,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.692,"Recent research indicates that pretraining cross-lingual language models on large-scale unlabeled texts yields significant performance improvements over various cross-lingual and low-resource tasks. Through training on one hundred languages and terabytes of texts, cross-lingual language models have proven to be effective in leveraging high-resource languages to enhance low-resource language processing and outperform monolingual models. In this paper, we further investigate the cross-lingual and cross-domain (CLCD) setting when a pretrained cross-lingual language model needs to adapt to new domains. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised feature decomposition method that can automatically extract domain-specific features and domain-invariant features from the entangled pretrained cross-lingual representations, given unlabeled raw texts in the source language. Our proposed model leverages mutual information estimation to decompose the representations computed by a cross-lingual model into domain-invariant and domain-specific parts. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art pretrained cross-lingual language model in the CLCD setting.

7,acl,2020,A Transformer-based Approach for Source Code Summarization,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.449,"Source code summarization is a process of generating summaries that describe software code, the majority of source code summarization usually generated manually, where the summaries are written by software developers. Recently, new automated approaches are becoming more useful. These approaches have been found to be effective in some cases. The main weaknesses of these approaches are that they never exploit code dependencies and summarize either the software classes or methods but not both. This paper proposes a source code summarization approach (Suncode) that produces a short description for each class and method in the software system. To validate the approach, it has been applied to several case studies. Moreover, the generated summaries are compared to summaries that written by human experts and to summaries that written by a state-of-the-art solution. Results of this paper found that Suncode summaries provide better information about code dependencies comparing with other studies. In addition, Suncode summaries can improve and support the current software documentation. The results found that manually written summaries were more precise and short as well."
8,acl,2020,"In Neural Machine Translation, What Does Transfer Learning Transfer?",https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.688,"Transfer learning between different language pairs has shown its effectiveness for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) in low-resource scenario. However, existing transfer methods involving a common target language are far from success in the extreme scenario of zero-shot translation, due to the language space mismatch problem between transferor (the parent model) and transferee (the child model) on the source side. To address this challenge, we propose an effective transfer learning approach based on cross-lingual pre-training. Our key idea is to make all source languages share the same feature space and thus enable a smooth transition for zero-shot translation. To this end, we introduce one monolingual pre-training method and two bilingual pre-training methods to obtain a universal encoder for different languages. Once the universal encoder is constructed, the parent model built on such encoder is trained with large-scale annotated data and then directly applied in zero-shot translation scenario. Experiments on two public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms strong pivot-based baseline and various multilingual NMT approaches."
9,acl,2020,Research on Task Discovery for Transfer Learning in Deep Neural Networks,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-srw.6,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) build on the success of deep learning models by extending them for use in graph spaces. Transfer learning has proven extremely successful for traditional deep learning problems: resulting in faster training and improved performance. Despite the increasing interest in GNNs and their use cases, there is little research on their transferability. This research demonstrates that transfer learning is effective with GNNs, and describes how source tasks and the choice of GNN impact the ability to learn generalisable knowledge. We perform experiments using real-world and synthetic data within the contexts of node classification and graph classification. To this end, we also provide a general methodology for transfer learning experimentation and present a novel algorithm for generating synthetic graph classification tasks. We compare the performance of GCN, GraphSAGE and GIN across both the synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate empirically that GNNs with inductive operations yield statistically significantly improved transfer. Further we show that similarity in community structure between source and target tasks support statistically significant improvements in transfer over and above the use of only the node attributes."
10,acl,2020,"Words Aren&apos;t Enough, Their Order Matters: On the Robustness of Grounding Visual Referring Expressions",https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.586,"Visual referring expression recognition is a challenging task that requires natural language understanding in the context of an image. We critically examine RefCOCOg, a standard benchmark for this task, using a human study and show that 83.7% of test instances do not require reasoning on linguistic structure, i.e., words are enough to identify the target object, the word order doesn't matter. To measure the true progress of existing models, we split the test set into two sets, one which requires reasoning on linguistic structure and the other which doesn't. Additionally, we create an out-of-distribution dataset Ref-Adv by asking crowdworkers to perturb in-domain examples such that the target object changes. Using these datasets, we empirically show that existing methods fail to exploit linguistic structure and are 12% to 23% lower in performance than the established progress for this task. We also propose two methods, one based on contrastive learning and the other based on multi-task learning, to increase the robustness of ViLBERT, the current state-of-the-art model for this task. Our datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/aws/aws-refcocog-adv"
11,acl,2020,Multi-Label and Multilingual News Framing Analysis,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.763,"We propose MINT, a new Multilingual INTimacy analysis dataset covering 13,372 tweets in 10 languages including English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Korean, Dutch, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic. We benchmarked a list of popular multilingual pre-trained language models.

12,acl,2020,Achieving Common Ground in Multi-modal Dialogue,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-tutorials.3,"Dialogue segmentation is a crucial task for dialogue systems allowing a better understanding of conversational texts. Despite recent progress in unsupervised dialogue segmentation methods, their performances are limited by the lack of explicit supervised signals for training. Furthermore, the precise definition of segmentation points in conversations still remains as a challenging problem, increasing the difficulty of collecting manual annotations. In this paper, we provide a feasible definition of dialogue segmentation points with the help of document-grounded dialogues and release a large-scale supervised dataset called SuperDialseg, containing 9K dialogues based on two prevalent document-grounded dialogue corpora, and also inherit their useful dialogue-related annotations. Moreover, we propose two models to exploit the dialogue characteristics, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SuperDialseg and showing good generalization ability on the out-of-domain datasets. Additionally, we provide a benchmark including 20 models across four categories for the dialogue segmentation task with several proper evaluation metrics. Based on the analysis of the empirical studies, we also provide some insights for the task of dialogue segmentation. We believe our work is an important step forward in the field of dialogue segmentation."
13,acl,2020,Cross-modal Coherence Modeling for Caption Generation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.583,"Coherent entity-aware multi-image captioning aims to generate coherent captions for multiple adjacent images in a news document. There are coherence relationships among adjacent images because they often describe same entities or events. These relationships are important for entity-aware multi-image captioning, but are neglected in entity-aware single-image captioning. Most existing work focuses on single-image captioning, while multi-image captioning has not been explored before. Hence, this paper proposes a coherent entity-aware multi-image captioning model by making use of coherence relationships. The model consists of a Transformer-based caption generation model and two types of contrastive learning-based coherence mechanisms. The generation model generates the caption by paying attention to the image and the accompanying text. The horizontal coherence mechanism aims to the make the caption coherent with captions of adjacent images. The vertical coherence mechanism aims to make the caption coherent with the image and the accompanying text. To evaluate coherence between captions, two coherence evaluation metrics are proposed. The new dataset DM800K is constructed that has more images per document than two existing datasets GoodNews and NYT800K, and are more suitable for multi-image captioning. Experiments on three datasets show the proposed captioning model outperforms 6 baselines according to single-image captioning evaluations, and the generated captions are more coherent than that of baselines according to coherence evaluations and human evaluations."
14,acl,2020,A Multitask Learning Approach for Diacritic Restoration,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.732,"In many languages like Arabic, diacritics are used to specify pronunciations as well as meanings. Such diacritics are often omitted in written text, increasing the number of possible pronunciations and meanings for a word. This results in a more ambiguous text making computational processing on such text more difficult. Diacritic restoration is the task of restoring missing diacritics in the written text. Most state-of-the-art diacritic restoration models are built on character level information which helps generalize the model to unseen data, but presumably lose useful information at the word level. Thus, to compensate for this loss, we investigate the use of multi-task learning to jointly optimize diacritic restoration with related NLP problems namely word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic diacritization. We use Arabic as a case study since it has sufficient data resources for tasks that we consider in our joint modeling. Our joint models significantly outperform the baselines and are comparable to the state-of-the-art models that are more complex relying on morphological analyzers and/or a lot more data (e.g. dialectal data)."
15,acl,2020,Target Inference in Argument Conclusion Generation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.399,"The purpose of an argumentative text is to support a certain conclusion. Yet, they are often omitted, expecting readers to infer them rather. While appropriate when reading an individual text, this rhetorical device limits accessibility when browsing many texts (e.g., on a search engine or on social media). In these scenarios, an explicit conclusion makes for a good candidate summary of an argumentative text. This is especially true if the conclusion is informative, emphasizing specific concepts from the text. With this paper we introduce the task of generating informative conclusions: First, Webis-ConcluGen-21 is compiled, a large-scale corpus of 136,996 samples of argumentative texts and their conclusions. Second, two paradigms for conclusion generation are investigated; one extractive, the other abstractive in nature. The latter exploits argumentative knowledge that augment the data via control codes and finetuning the BART model on several subsets of the corpus. Third, insights are provided into the suitability of our corpus for the task, the differences between the two generation paradigms, the trade-off between informativeness and conciseness, and the impact of encoding argumentative knowledge. The corpus, code, and the trained models are publicly available."
16,acl,2020,Probing Linguistic Features of Sentence-Level Representations in Relation Extraction,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.140,"Despite the recent progress, little is known about the features captured by state-of-the-art neural relation extraction (RE) models. Common methods encode the source sentence, conditioned on the entity mentions, before classifying the relation. However, the complexity of the task makes it difficult to understand how encoder architecture and supporting linguistic knowledge affect the features learned by the encoder. We introduce 14 probing tasks targeting linguistic properties relevant to RE, and we use them to study representations learned by more than 40 different encoder architecture and linguistic feature combinations trained on two datasets, TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8. We find that the bias induced by the architecture and the inclusion of linguistic features are clearly expressed in the probing task performance. For example, adding contextualized word representations greatly increases performance on probing tasks with a focus on named entity and part-of-speech information, and yields better results in RE. In contrast, entity masking improves RE, but considerably lowers performance on entity type related probing tasks."
17,acl,2020,TACRED Revisited: A Thorough Evaluation of the TACRED Relation Extraction Task,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.142,"TACRED is one of the largest and most widely used sentence-level relation extraction datasets. Proposed models that are evaluated using this dataset consistently set new state-of-the-art performance. However, they still exhibit large error rates despite leveraging external knowledge and unsupervised pretraining on large text corpora. A recent study suggested that this may be due to poor dataset quality. The study observed that over 50% of the most challenging sentences from the development and test sets are incorrectly labeled and account for an average drop of 8% f1-score in model performance. However, this study was limited to a small biased sample of 5k (out of a total of 106k) sentences, substantially restricting the generalizability and broader implications of its findings. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by: (i) performing a comprehensive study over the whole TACRED dataset, (ii) proposing an improved crowdsourcing strategy and deploying it to re-annotate the whole dataset, and (iii) performing a thorough analysis to understand how correcting the TACRED annotations affects previously published results. After verification, we observed that 23.9% of TACRED labels are incorrect. Moreover, evaluating several models on our revised dataset yields an average f1-score improvement of 14.3% and helps uncover significant relationships between the different models (rather than simply offsetting or scaling their scores by a constant factor). Finally, aside from our analysis we also release Re-TACRED, a new completely re-annotated version of the TACRED dataset that can be used to perform reliable evaluation of relation extraction models."
18,acl,2020,ASSET: A Dataset for Tuning and Evaluation of Sentence Simplification Models with Multiple Rewriting Transformations,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.424,"In order to simplify a sentence, human editors perform multiple rewriting transformations: they split it into several shorter sentences, paraphrase words (i.e. replacing complex words or phrases by simpler synonyms), reorder components, and/or delete information deemed unnecessary. Despite these varied range of possible text alterations, current models for automatic sentence simplification are evaluated using datasets that are focused on a single transformation, such as lexical paraphrasing or splitting. This makes it impossible to understand the ability of simplification models in more realistic settings. To alleviate this limitation, this paper introduces ASSET, a new dataset for assessing sentence simplification in English. ASSET is a crowdsourced multi-reference corpus where each simplification was produced by executing several rewriting transformations. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that simplifications in ASSET are better at capturing characteristics of simplicity when compared to other standard evaluation datasets for the task. Furthermore, we motivate the need for developing better methods for automatic evaluation using ASSET, since we show that current popular metrics may not be suitable when multiple simplification transformations are performed."
19,acl,2020,An Effectiveness Metric for Ordinal Classification: Formal Properties and Experimental Results,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.363,"In Ordinal Classification tasks, items have to be assigned to classes that have a relative ordering, such as positive, neutral, negative in sentiment analysis. Remarkably, the most popular evaluation metrics for ordinal classification tasks either ignore relevant information (for instance, precision/recall on each of the classes ignores their relative ordering) or assume additional information (for instance, Mean Average Error assumes absolute distances between classes). In this paper we propose a new metric for Ordinal Classification, Closeness Evaluation Measure, that is rooted on Measurement Theory and Information Theory. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results over both synthetic data and data from NLP shared tasks indicate that the proposed metric captures quality aspects from different traditional tasks simultaneously. In addition, it generalizes some popular classification (nominal scale) and error minimization (interval scale) metrics, depending on the measurement scale in which it is instantiated."
20,acl,2020,Unsupervised Opinion Summarization with Noising and Denoising,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.175,"The supervised training of high-capacity models on large datasets containing hundreds of thousands of document-summary pairs is critical to the recent success of deep learning techniques for abstractive summarization. Unfortunately, in most domains (other than news) such training data is not available and cannot be easily sourced. In this paper we enable the use of supervised learning for the setting where there are only documents available (e.g.,~product or business reviews) without ground truth summaries. We create a synthetic dataset from a corpus of user reviews by sampling a review, pretending it is a summary, and generating noisy versions thereof which we treat as pseudo-review input. We introduce several linguistically motivated noise generation functions and a summarization model which learns to denoise the input and generate the original review. At test time, the model accepts genuine reviews and generates a summary containing salient opinions, treating those that do not reach consensus as noise. Extensive automatic and human evaluation shows that our model brings substantial improvements over both abstractive and extractive baselines."

Our systems are based on the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) with several novel and effective variants. In our experiments, we employ data filtering, large-scale synthetic data generation (i.e., back-translation, knowledge distillation, forward-translation, iterative in-domain knowledge transfer), advanced finetuning approaches, and boosted Self-BLEU based model ensemble. Our constrained systems achieve 36.9, 46.9, 27.8 and 31.3 case-sensitive BLEU scores on English->Chinese, English->Japanese, Japanese->English and English->German, respectively. The BLEU scores of English->Chinese, English->Japanese and Japanese->English are the highest among all submissions, and that of English->German is the highest among all constrained submissions."
22,acl,2020,Good-Enough Compositional Data Augmentation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.676,"Although sequence-to-sequence models often achieve good performance in semantic parsing for i.i.d. data, their performance is still inferior in compositional generalization. Several data augmentation methods have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, prior work only leveraged superficial grammar or rules for data augmentation, which resulted in limited improvement. We propose to use subtree substitution for compositional data augmentation, where we consider subtrees with similar semantic functions as exchangeable. Our experiments showed that such augmented data led to significantly better performance on SCAN and GeoQuery, and reached new SOTA on compositional split of GeoQuery."

Previous work has attempted to predict schwa deletion in a rule-based fashion using prosodic or phonetic analysis. We present the first statistical schwa deletion classifier for Hindi, which relies solely on the orthography as the input and outperforms previous approaches. We trained our model on a newly-compiled pronunciation lexicon extracted from various online dictionaries. Our best Hindi model achieves state of the art performance, and also achieves good performance on a closely related language, Punjabi, without modification."

They have demonstrated superior performance in many applications. However, the operation of an IT2 fuzzy system is more complex than that of its type-1 counterpart. There are many questions to be answered in designing an IT2 fuzzy system: Should singleton or non-singleton fuzzifier be used? How many membership functions (MFs) should be used for each input? Should Gaussian or piecewise linear MFs be used? Should Mamdani or Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) inference be used? Should minimum or product $t$-norm be used? Should type-reduction be used or not? How to optimize the IT2 fuzzy system? These questions may look overwhelming and confusing to IT2 beginners. In this paper we recommend some representative starting choices for an IT2 fuzzy system design, which hopefully will make IT2 fuzzy systems more accessible to IT2 fuzzy system designers."
25,acl,2020,On the Cross-lingual Transferability of Monolingual Representations,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.421,"In this work, we provide a systematic and comprehensive empirical comparison of pretrained multilingual language models versus their monolingual counterparts with regard to their monolingual task performance. We study a set of nine typologically diverse languages with readily available pretrained monolingual models on a set of five diverse monolingual downstream tasks. We first aim to establish, via fair and controlled comparisons, if a gap between the multilingual and the corresponding monolingual representation of that language exists, and subsequently investigate the reason for any performance difference. To disentangle conflating factors, we train new monolingual models on the same data, with monolingually and multilingually trained tokenizers. We find that while the pretraining data size is an important factor, a designated monolingual tokenizer plays an equally important role in the downstream performance. Our results show that languages that are adequately represented in the multilingual model's vocabulary exhibit negligible performance decreases over their monolingual counterparts. We further find that replacing the original multilingual tokenizer with the specialized monolingual tokenizer improves the downstream performance of the multilingual model for almost every task and language."
26,acl,2020,A Call for More Rigor in Unsupervised Cross-lingual Learning,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.658,"We review motivations, definition, approaches, and methodology for unsupervised cross-lingual learning and call for a more rigorous position in each of them. An existing rationale for such research is based on the lack of parallel data for many of the world's languages. However, we argue that a scenario without any parallel data and abundant monolingual data is unrealistic in practice. We also discuss different training signals that have been used in previous work, which depart from the pure unsupervised setting. We then describe common methodological issues in tuning and evaluation of unsupervised cross-lingual models and present best practices. Finally, we provide a unified outlook for different types of research in this area (i.e., cross-lingual word embeddings, deep multilingual pretraining, and unsupervised machine translation) and argue for comparable evaluation of these models."
27,acl,2020,Logic-Guided Data Augmentation and Regularization for Consistent Question Answering,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.499,"Data Augmentation (DA) is frequently used to automatically provide additional training data without extra human annotation. However, data augmentation may introduce noisy data that impairs training. To guarantee the quality of augmented data, existing methods either assume no noise exists in the augmented data and adopt consistency training or use simple heuristics such as training loss and diversity constraints to filter out ``noisy'' data. However, those filtered examples may still contain useful information, and dropping them completely causes loss of supervision signals. In this paper, based on the assumption that the original dataset is cleaner than the augmented data, we propose an on-the-fly denoising technique for data augmentation that learns from soft augmented labels provided by an organic teacher model trained on the cleaner original data. A simple self-regularization module is applied to force the model prediction to be consistent across two distinct dropouts to further prevent overfitting on noisy labels. Our method can be applied to augmentation techniques in general and can consistently improve the performance on both text classification and question-answering tasks."

However, despite these advances, there are still desirable functionalities missing from the fact-checking pipeline. In this survey, we focus on the explanation functionality -- that is fact-checking systems providing reasons for their predictions. We summarize existing methods for explaining the predictions of fact-checking systems and we explore trends in this topic. Further, we consider what makes for good explanations in this specific domain through a comparative analysis of existing fact-checking explanations against some desirable properties. Finally, we propose further research directions for generating fact-checking explanations, and describe how these may lead to improvements in the research area."

We extract parallel phrases and sentences from the pseudo-parallel corpus and augment it with the parallel corpus to train the NMT models. With the proposed approach, we observe an improvement in the Machine Translation (MT) system for 3 low-resource language pairs, Hindi-Marathi, English-Marathi, and English-Pashto, and 6 translation directions by up to 2.7 BLEU points, on the FLORES test data. These BLEU score improvements are over the models trained using the whole pseudo-parallel corpus augmented with the parallel corpus."
30,acl,2020,Not All Claims are Created Equal: Choosing the Right Statistical Approach to Assess Hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.506,"Empirical research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has adopted a narrow set of principles for assessing hypotheses, relying mainly on p-value computation, which suffers from several known issues. While alternative proposals have been well-debated and adopted in other fields, they remain rarely discussed or used within the NLP community. We address this gap by contrasting various hypothesis assessment techniques, especially those not commonly used in the field (such as evaluations based on Bayesian inference). Since these statistical techniques differ in the hypotheses they can support, we argue that practitioners should first decide their target hypothesis before choosing an assessment method. This is crucial because common fallacies, misconceptions, and misinterpretation surrounding hypothesis assessment methods often stem from a discrepancy between what one would like to claim versus what the method used actually assesses. Our survey reveals that these issues are omnipresent in the NLP research community. As a step forward, we provide best practices and guidelines tailored to NLP research, as well as an easy-to-use package called 'HyBayes' for Bayesian assessment of hypotheses, complementing existing tools."
31,acl,2020,A Comprehensive Analysis of Preprocessing for Word Representation Learning in Affective Tasks,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.514,"Data representation is a fundamental task in machine learning. The representation of data affects the performance of the whole machine learning system. In a long history, the representation of data is done by feature engineering, and researchers aim at designing better features for specific tasks. Recently, the rapid development of deep learning and representation learning has brought new inspiration to various domains.   In natural language processing, the most widely used feature representation is the Bag-of-Words model. This model has the data sparsity problem and cannot keep the word order information. Other features such as part-of-speech tagging or more complex syntax features can only fit for specific tasks in most cases. This thesis focuses on word representation and document representation. We compare the existing systems and present our new model.   First, for generating word embeddings, we make comprehensive comparisons among existing word embedding models. In terms of theory, we figure out the relationship between the two most important models, i.e., Skip-gram and GloVe. In our experiments, we analyze three key points in generating word embeddings, including the model construction, the training corpus and parameter design. We evaluate word embeddings with three types of tasks, and we argue that they cover the existing use of word embeddings. Through theory and practical experiments, we present some guidelines for how to generate a good word embedding.   Second, in Chinese character or word representation. We introduce the joint training of Chinese character and word. ...   Third, for document representation, we analyze the existing document representation models, including recursive NNs, recurrent NNs and convolutional NNs. We point out the drawbacks of these models and present our new model, the recurrent convolutional neural networks. ..."
32,acl,2020,Analyzing the Persuasive Effect of Style in News Editorial Argumentation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.287,"We propose MultiOpEd, an open-domain news editorial corpus that supports various tasks pertaining to the argumentation structure in news editorials, focusing on automatic perspective discovery. News editorial is a genre of persuasive text, where the argumentation structure is usually implicit. However, the arguments presented in an editorial typically center around a concise, focused thesis, which we refer to as their perspective. MultiOpEd aims at supporting the study of multiple tasks relevant to automatic perspective discovery, where a system is expected to produce a single-sentence thesis statement summarizing the arguments presented. We argue that identifying and abstracting such natural language perspectives from editorials is a crucial step toward studying the implicit argumentation structure in news editorials. We first discuss the challenges and define a few conceptual tasks towards our goal. To demonstrate the utility of MultiOpEd and the induced tasks, we study the problem of perspective summarization in a multi-task learning setting, as a case study. We show that, with the induced tasks as auxiliary tasks, we can improve the quality of the perspective summary generated. We hope that MultiOpEd will be a useful resource for future studies on argumentation in the news editorial domain."
33,acl,2020,Fluent Response Generation for Conversational Question Answering,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.19,"Question answering (QA) is an important aspect of open-domain conversational agents, garnering specific research focus in the conversational QA (ConvQA) subtask. One notable limitation of recent ConvQA efforts is the response being answer span extraction from the target corpus, thus ignoring the natural language generation (NLG) aspect of high-quality conversational agents. In this work, we propose a method for situating QA responses within a SEQ2SEQ NLG approach to generate fluent grammatical answer responses while maintaining correctness. From a technical perspective, we use data augmentation to generate training data for an end-to-end system. Specifically, we develop Syntactic Transformations (STs) to produce question-specific candidate answer responses and rank them using a BERT-based classifier (Devlin et al., 2019). Human evaluation on SQuAD 2.0 data (Rajpurkar et al., 2018) demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline CoQA and QuAC models in generating conversational responses. We further show our model's scalability by conducting tests on the CoQA dataset. The code and data are available at https://github.com/abaheti95/QADialogSystem."

Our approach originates in the observable structure of a corpus, which we use to define and isolate grammaticality (syntactic information) and meaning/pragmatics information. We describe the formal characteristics of an autonomous syntax and show that it becomes possible to search for syntax-based lexical categories with a simple optimization process, without any prior hypothesis on the form of the model."
35,acl,2020,Speaker Sensitive Response Evaluation Model,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.568,"Automatic evaluation of open-domain dialogue response generation is very challenging because there are many appropriate responses for a given context. Existing evaluation models merely compare the generated response with the ground truth response and rate many of the appropriate responses as inappropriate if they deviate from the ground truth. One approach to resolve this problem is to consider the similarity of the generated response with the conversational context. In this paper, we propose an automatic evaluation model based on that idea and learn the model parameters from an unlabeled conversation corpus. Our approach considers the speakers in defining the different levels of similar context. We use a Twitter conversation corpus that contains many speakers and conversations to test our evaluation model. Experiments show that our model outperforms the other existing evaluation metrics in terms of high correlation with human annotation scores. We also show that our model trained on Twitter can be applied to movie dialogues without any additional training. We provide our code and the learned parameters so that they can be used for automatic evaluation of dialogue response generation models."
36,acl,2020,What Was Written vs. Who Read It: News Media Profiling Using Text Analysis and Social Media Context,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.308,"Predicting the political bias and the factuality of reporting of entire news outlets are critical elements of media profiling, which is an understudied but an increasingly important research direction. The present level of proliferation of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online, has made it impossible to fact-check every single suspicious claim, either manually or automatically. Alternatively, we can profile entire news outlets and look for those that are likely to publish fake or biased content. This approach makes it possible to detect likely ""fake news"" the moment they are published, by simply checking the reliability of their source. From a practical perspective, political bias and factuality of reporting have a linguistic aspect but also a social context. Here, we study the impact of both, namely (i) what was written (i.e., what was published by the target medium, and how it describes itself on Twitter) vs. (ii) who read it (i.e., analyzing the readers of the target medium on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube). We further study (iii) what was written about the target medium on Wikipedia. The evaluation results show that what was written matters most, and that putting all information sources together yields huge improvements over the current state-of-the-art."

Consuming such a volume of news presents an almost insurmountable challenge. For example, a reader searching on Bloomberg's system for news about the U.K. would find 10,000 articles on a typical day. Apple Inc., the world's most journalistically covered company, garners around 1,800 news articles a day.   We realized that a new kind of summarization engine was needed, one that would condense large volumes of news into short, easy to absorb points. The system would filter out noise and duplicates to identify and summarize key news about companies, countries or markets.   When given a user query, Bloomberg's solution, Key News Themes (or NSTM), leverages state-of-the-art semantic clustering techniques and novel summarization methods to produce comprehensive, yet concise, digests to dramatically simplify the news consumption process.   NSTM is available to hundreds of thousands of readers around the world and serves thousands of requests daily with sub-second latency. At ACL 2020, we will present a demo of NSTM."

The development of a Corpus Acquisition Component (CAC) for extracting monolingual and bilingual data from the web is one of the most innovative building blocks of PANACEA. The CAC, which is the first stage in the PANACEA pipeline for building Language Resources, adopts an efficient and distributed methodology to crawl for web documents with rich textual content in specific languages and predefined domains. The CAC includes modules that can acquire parallel data from sites with in-domain content available in more than one language. In order to extrinsically evaluate the CAC methodology, we have conducted several experiments that used crawled parallel corpora for the identification and extraction of parallel sentences using sentence alignment. The corpora were then successfully used for domain adaptation of Machine Translation Systems."

40,acl,2020,PLATO: Pre-trained Dialogue Generation Model with Discrete Latent Variable,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.9,"Conditional variational models, using either continuous or discrete latent variables, are powerful for open-domain dialogue response generation. However, previous works show that continuous latent variables tend to reduce the coherence of generated responses. In this paper, we also found that discrete latent variables have difficulty capturing more diverse expressions. To tackle these problems, we combine the merits of both continuous and discrete latent variables and propose a Hybrid Latent Variable (HLV) method. Specifically, HLV constrains the global semantics of responses through discrete latent variables and enriches responses with continuous latent variables. Thus, we diversify the generated responses while maintaining relevance and coherence. In addition, we propose Conditional Hybrid Variational Transformer (CHVT) to construct and to utilize HLV with transformers for dialogue generation. Through fine-grained symbolic-level semantic information and additive Gaussian mixing, we construct the distribution of continuous variables, prompting the generation of diverse expressions. Meanwhile, to maintain the relevance and coherence, the discrete latent variable is optimized by self-separation training. Experimental results on two dialogue generation datasets (DailyDialog and Opensubtitles) show that CHVT is superior to traditional transformer-based variational mechanism w.r.t. diversity, relevance and coherence metrics. Moreover, we also demonstrate the benefit of applying HLV to fine-tuning two pre-trained dialogue models (PLATO and BART-base)."
41,acl,2020,From Arguments to Key Points: Towards Automatic Argument Summarization,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.371,"When summarizing a collection of views, arguments or opinions on some topic, it is often desirable not only to extract the most salient points, but also to quantify their prevalence. Work on multi-document summarization has traditionally focused on creating textual summaries, which lack this quantitative aspect. Recent work has proposed to summarize arguments by mapping them to a small set of expert-generated key points, where the salience of each key point corresponds to the number of its matching arguments. The current work advances key point analysis in two important respects: first, we develop a method for automatic extraction of key points, which enables fully automatic analysis, and is shown to achieve performance comparable to a human expert. Second, we demonstrate that the applicability of key point analysis goes well beyond argumentation data. Using models trained on publicly available argumentation datasets, we achieve promising results in two additional domains: municipal surveys and user reviews. An additional contribution is an in-depth evaluation of argument-to-key point matching models, where we substantially outperform previous results."

BHWR facilitates Variational Bayes word representation learning combined with semantic taxonomy modeling via hierarchical priors. By propagating relevant information between related words, BHWR utilizes the taxonomy to improve the quality of such representations. Evaluation of several linguistic datasets demonstrates the advantages of BHWR over suitable alternatives that facilitate Bayesian modeling with or without semantic priors. Finally, we further show that BHWR produces better representations for rare words."
43,acl,2020,A Joint Model for Document Segmentation and Segment Labeling,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.29,"Recognizing human actions from untrimmed videos is an important task in activity understanding, and poses unique challenges in modeling long-range temporal relations. Recent works adopt a predict-and-refine strategy which converts an initial prediction to action segments for global context modeling. However, the generated segment representations are often noisy and exhibit inaccurate segment boundaries, over-segmentation and other problems. To deal with these issues, we propose an attention based approach which we call \textit{temporal segment transformer}, for joint segment relation modeling and denoising. The main idea is to denoise segment representations using attention between segment and frame representations, and also use inter-segment attention to capture temporal correlations between segments. The refined segment representations are used to predict action labels and adjust segment boundaries, and a final action segmentation is produced based on voting from segment masks. We show that this novel architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the popular 50Salads, GTEA and Breakfast benchmarks. We also conduct extensive ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of different components of our design."

One strategy is creating assignments that encourage students to reflect on ethical issues inherent to the code they write. Building off prior work that has surveyed students after doing such assignments in class, we conducted focus groups with students who reviewed a new introductory ethics-based CS assignment. In this experience report, we present a case study describing our process of designing an ethics-based assignment and proposing the assignment to students for feedback. Participants in our focus groups not only shared feedback on the assignment, but also on the integration of ethics into coding assignments in general, revealing the benefits and challenges of this work from a student perspective. We also generated novel ethics-oriented assignment concepts alongside students. Deriving from tech controversies that participants felt most affected by, we created a bank of ideas as a starting point for further curriculum development."

In this paper, we present a continuum formulation for dislocation climb velocity based on densities of dislocations. The obtained continuum formulation is an accurate approximation of the Green's function based discrete dislocation dynamics method (Gu et al. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 83:319-337, 2015). The continuum dislocation climb formulation has the advantage of accounting for both the long-range effect of vacancy bulk diffusion and that of the Peach-Koehler climb force, and the two longrange effects are canceled into a short-range effect (integral with fast-decaying kernel) and in some special cases, a completely local effect. This significantly simplifies the calculation in the Green's function based discrete dislocation dynamics method, in which a linear system has to be solved over the entire system for the long-range effect of vacancy diffusion and the long-range Peach-Koehler climb force has to be calculated. This obtained continuum dislocation climb velocity can be applied in any available continuum dislocation dynamics frameworks. We also present numerical validations for this continuum climb velocity and simulation examples for implementation in continuum dislocation dynamics frameworks."

Evaluating Speech Translation Technology on the MuST-SHE Corpus,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.619,"Translating from languages without productive grammatical gender like English into gender-marked languages is a well-known difficulty for machines. This difficulty is also due to the fact that the training data on which models are built typically reflect the asymmetries of natural languages, gender bias included. Exclusively fed with textual data, machine translation is intrinsically constrained by the fact that the input sentence does not always contain clues about the gender identity of the referred human entities. But what happens with speech translation, where the input is an audio signal? Can audio provide additional information to reduce gender bias? We present the first thorough investigation of gender bias in speech translation, contributing with: i) the release of a benchmark useful for future studies, and ii) the comparison of different technologies (cascade and end-to-end) on two language directions (English-Italian/French)."

In order to discover $w$, the player can make at most $\ell$ guesses, which must also be words from $D$, all words in $D$ having the same length $k$. After each guess, the player is notified of the positions in which their guess matches the secret word, as well as letters in the guess that appear in the secret word in a different position. We study the game of Wordle from a complexity perspective, proving NP-hardness of its natural formalization: to decide given a dictionary $D$ and an integer $\ell$ if the player can guarantee to discover the secret word within $\ell$ guesses. Moreover, we prove that hardness holds even over instances where words have length $k = 5$, and that even in this case it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of guesses required to guarantee discovering the secret word. We also present results regarding its parameterized complexity and offer some related open problems."

Our framework introduces a principled structure for the answer choices and ties them to textual span annotations. The framework is implemented in OneStopQA, a new high-quality dataset for evaluation and analysis of reading comprehension in English. We use this dataset to demonstrate that STARC can be leveraged for a key new application for the development of SAT-like reading comprehension materials: automatic annotation quality probing via span ablation experiments. We further show that it enables in-depth analyses and comparisons between machine and human reading comprehension behavior, including error distributions and guessing ability. Our experiments also reveal that the standard multiple choice dataset in NLP, RACE, is limited in its ability to measure reading comprehension. 47% of its questions can be guessed by machines without accessing the passage, and 18% are unanimously judged by humans as not having a unique correct answer. OneStopQA provides an alternative test set for reading comprehension which alleviates these shortcomings and has a substantially higher human ceiling performance."

In this work, we propose a set of dialog acts for modelling such dialogs and annotate the TEACh dataset that includes over 3,000 situated, task oriented conversations (consisting of 39.5k utterances in total) with dialog acts. TEACh-DA is one of the first large scale dataset of dialog act annotations for embodied task completion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of this annotated dataset in training models for tagging the dialog acts of a given utterance, predicting the dialog act of the next response given a dialog history, and use the dialog acts to guide agent's non-dialog behaviour. In particular, our experiments on the TEACh Execution from Dialog History task where the model predicts the sequence of low level actions to be executed in the environment for embodied task completion, demonstrate that dialog acts can improve end task success rate by up to 2 points compared to the system without dialog acts."

52,acl,2020,Adaptive Transformers for Learning Multimodal Representations,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-srw.1,"Recently, vision transformer (ViT) based multimodal learning methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of face anti-spoofing (FAS) systems. However, there are still no works to explore the fundamental natures (\textit{e.g.}, modality-aware inputs, suitable multimodal pre-training, and efficient finetuning) in vanilla ViT for multimodal FAS. In this paper, we investigate three key factors (i.e., inputs, pre-training, and finetuning) in ViT for multimodal FAS with RGB, Infrared (IR), and Depth. First, in terms of the ViT inputs, we find that leveraging local feature descriptors benefits the ViT on IR modality but not RGB or Depth modalities. Second, in observation of the inefficiency on direct finetuning the whole or partial ViT, we design an adaptive multimodal adapter (AMA), which can efficiently aggregate local multimodal features while freezing majority of ViT parameters. Finally, in consideration of the task (FAS vs. generic object classification) and modality (multimodal vs. unimodal) gaps, ImageNet pre-trained models might be sub-optimal for the multimodal FAS task. To bridge these gaps, we propose the modality-asymmetric masked autoencoder (M$^{2}$A$^{2}$E) for multimodal FAS self-supervised pre-training without costly annotated labels. Compared with the previous modality-symmetric autoencoder, the proposed M$^{2}$A$^{2}$E is able to learn more intrinsic task-aware representation and compatible with modality-agnostic (e.g., unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal) downstream settings. Extensive experiments with both unimodal (RGB, Depth, IR) and multimodal (RGB+Depth, RGB+IR, Depth+IR, RGB+Depth+IR) settings conducted on multimodal FAS benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods. We hope these findings and solutions can facilitate the future research for ViT-based multimodal FAS."

On the other hand, simple recurrent networks (SRNs), which appear more biologically grounded in terms of synaptic connections, have generally been less successful at capturing long-range dependencies as well as the loci of grammatical errors in an unsupervised setting. In this paper, we seek to develop models that bridge the gap between biological plausibility and linguistic competence. We propose a new architecture, the Decay RNN, which incorporates the decaying nature of neuronal activations and models the excitatory and inhibitory connections in a population of neurons. Besides its biological inspiration, our model also shows competitive performance relative to LSTMs on subject-verb agreement, sentence grammaticality, and language modeling tasks. These results provide some pointers towards probing the nature of the inductive biases required for RNN architectures to model linguistic phenomena successfully."

To this end, we use traditional word embeddings and apply specialization methods to better capture semantic relations between words. In our approach, we leverage external knowledge from rich lexical resources such as BabelNet. We also show that our proposed post-specialization method based on an adversarial neural network with the Wasserstein distance allows to gain improvements over state-of-the-art methods on two tasks: word similarity and dialog state tracking."

We propose a bi-encoder model that independently embeds (1) the target word with its surrounding context and (2) the dictionary definition, or gloss, of each sense. The encoders are jointly optimized in the same representation space, so that sense disambiguation can be performed by finding the nearest sense embedding for each target word embedding. Our system outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on English all-words WSD; these gains predominantly come from improved performance on rare senses, leading to a 31.1% error reduction on less frequent senses over prior work. This demonstrates that rare senses can be more effectively disambiguated by modeling their definitions."

The goal is to record the state of the AA literature: who and how many of us are publishing? what are we publishing on? where and in what form are we publishing? and what is the impact of our publications? The answers are usually in the form of numbers, graphs, and inter-connected visualizations. Special emphasis is laid on the demographics and inclusiveness of NLP publishing. Notably, we find that only about 30% of first authors are female, and that this percentage has not improved since the year 2000. We also show that, on average, female first authors are cited less than male first authors, even when controlling for experience. We hope that recording citation and participation gaps across demographic groups will encourage more inclusiveness and fairness in research."

Mainly in Relation Extraction where static, contextualized and others representations that are capable of explaining word meanings through the linguistic features that these incorporates. In this work addresses the question of how is improved the relation extraction using different types of representations generated by pretrained language representation models. We benchmarked our approach using popular word representation models, replacing and concatenating static, contextualized and others representations of hand-extracted features. The experiments show that representation is a crucial element to choose when DL approach is applied. Word embeddings from Flair and BERT can be well interpreted by a deep learning model for RE task, and replacing static word embeddings with contextualized word representations could lead to significant improvements. While, the hand-created representations requires is time-consuming and not is ensure a improve in combination with others representations."

Though previous studies have made substantial efforts for automated keyphrase extraction and generation, surprisingly, few studies have been made for \textit{keyphrase completion} (KPC). KPC aims to generate more keyphrases for document (e.g. scientific publication) taking advantage of document content along with a very limited number of known keyphrases, which can be applied to improve text indexing system, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel KPC method with an encoder-decoder framework. We name it \textit{deep keyphrase completion} (DKPC) since it attempts to capture the deep semantic meaning of the document content together with known keyphrases via a deep learning framework. Specifically, the encoder and the decoder in DKPC play different roles to make full use of the known keyphrases. The former considers the keyphrase-guiding factors, which aggregates information of known keyphrases into context. On the contrary, the latter considers the keyphrase-inhibited factor to inhibit semantically repeated keyphrase generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model."

We argue that creating a question answering dataset -- and the ubiquitous leaderboard that goes with it -- closely resembles running a trivia tournament: you write questions, have agents (either humans or machines) answer the questions, and declare a winner. However, the research community has ignored the decades of hard-learned lessons from decades of the trivia community creating vibrant, fair, and effective question answering competitions. After detailing problems with existing QA datasets, we outline the key lessons -- removing ambiguity, discriminating skill, and adjudicating disputes -- that can transfer to QA research and how they might be implemented for the QA community."

The previous researches mainly focused on designing dialog generation models in a single scenario, while comprehensive abilities are required to handle tasks under various scenarios in the real world.

Specifically, we propose a transferable response generator pre-trained on diverse large-scale dialog corpora as the backbone of MSDF, consisting of BERT-based encoders and a GPT-based decoder. To select the response consistent with dialog history, we propose a consistency selector trained through negative sampling. Moreover, the flexible copy mechanism of external knowledge is also employed to enhance the utilization of multiform knowledge in various scenarios. We conduct experiments on knowledge grounded dialog, recommendation dialog, and persona based dialog tasks. The experimental results indicate that our MSDF outperforms the baseline models with a large margin. In the Multi-skill Dialog of 2021 Language and Intelligence Challenge, our general MSDF won the 3rd prize, which proves our MSDF is effective and competitive."

Such algorithms assume training-time access to an expert that can provide the optimal action at any queried state; unfortunately, the number of such queries is often prohibitive, frequently rendering these approaches impractical. To combat this query complexity, we consider an active learning setting in which the learning algorithm has additional access to a much cheaper noisy heuristic that provides noisy guidance. Our algorithm, LEAQI, learns a difference classifier that predicts when the expert is likely to disagree with the heuristic, and queries the expert only when necessary. We apply LEAQI to three sequence labeling tasks, demonstrating significantly fewer queries to the expert and comparable (or better) accuracies over a passive approach."

In this paper, we introduce Geodesic Summarizer (GeoSumm), a novel system to perform unsupervised extractive opinion summarization. GeoSumm involves an encoder-decoder based representation learning model, that generates representations of text as a distribution over latent semantic units. GeoSumm generates these representations by performing dictionary learning over pre-trained text representations at multiple decoder layers. We then use these representations to quantify the relevance of review sentences using a novel approximate geodesic distance based scoring mechanism. We use the relevance scores to identify popular opinions in order to compose general and aspect-specific summaries. Our proposed model, GeoSumm, achieves state-of-the-art performance on three opinion summarization datasets. We perform additional experiments to analyze the functioning of our model and showcase the generalization ability of {\X} across different domains."

This is relevant both for time-critical and on-device computations using neural networks. The stabilized lottery ticket hypothesis states that networks can be pruned after none or few training iterations, using a mask computed based on the unpruned converged model. On the transformer architecture and the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French tasks, we show that stabilized lottery ticket pruning performs similar to magnitude pruning for sparsity levels of up to 85%, and propose a new combination of pruning techniques that outperforms all other techniques for even higher levels of sparsity. Furthermore, we confirm that the parameter's initial sign and not its specific value is the primary factor for successful training, and show that magnitude pruning could be used to find winning lottery tickets."
65,acl,2020,Can We Predict New Facts with Open Knowledge Graph Embeddings? A Benchmark for Open Link Prediction,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.209,"Two recent papers on prediction of chaotic systems, one on multi-view embedding1 , and the second on prediction in projection2 provide empirical evidence to support particular prediction methods for chaotic systems. Multi-view embedding1 is a method of using several multivariate time series to come up with an improved embedding based predictor of a chaotic time series. Prediction in projection2 discusses how much smaller embeddings can provide useful prediction even though they may not be able to resolve the dynamics of the system. Both papers invoke a nearest neighbor3, or Lorenz method of Analogue (LMA)4 approach to estimation. However with open high dimensional chaotic systems there may be no very close nearest neighbor trajectories in a history, so in this paper we add in the thread of linear response theory5, although our approach is quite simple assuming that linear regressions6 on multiple embeddings5 will be sufficient. The approach is thus to create linear response models5 of multiple1 low dimensional embeddings2 to provide practical methods of predicting in high dimensional, open chaotic systems. Some theory is developed, mostly around two unproven conjectures to suggest methods of prediction, and they are applied to prediction in the earth's climate system (predicting regional rainfall in a small region) multiple seasons ahead and to power a simulated automated trading program applied to three stock indexes, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Dow Jones transportation average, and the Dow Jones utility average, based on data from 1929 through 20077"

Yet, manually curated lexicons are only available for a handful of languages, leaving most languages of the world without such a precious resource for downstream applications. Even worse, their coverage is often limited both in terms of the lexical units they contain and the emotional variables they feature. In order to break this bottleneck, we here introduce a methodology for creating almost arbitrarily large emotion lexicons for any target language. Our approach requires nothing but a source language emotion lexicon, a bilingual word translation model, and a target language embedding model. Fulfilling these requirements for 91 languages, we are able to generate representationally rich high-coverage lexicons comprising eight emotional variables with more than 100k lexical entries each. We evaluated the automatically generated lexicons against human judgment from 26 datasets, spanning 12 typologically diverse languages, and found that our approach produces results in line with state-of-the-art monolingual approaches to lexicon creation and even surpasses human reliability for some languages and variables.

However, due to its reliance on target language properties and generation, the BLEU metric does not allow an assessment of which translation directions are more difficult to model. In this paper, we propose cross-mutual information (XMI): an asymmetric information-theoretic metric of machine translation difficulty that exploits the probabilistic nature of most neural machine translation models. XMI allows us to better evaluate the difficulty of translating text into the target language while controlling for the difficulty of the target-side generation component independent of the translation task. We then present the first systematic and controlled study of cross-lingual translation difficulties using modern neural translation systems. Code for replicating our experiments is available online at https://github.com/e-bug/nmt-difficulty."

In addition, these works represent sign language as a sequence of skeleton pose vectors, projected to an abstract representation with no inherent skeletal structure. In this paper, we represent sign language sequences as a skeletal graph structure, with joints as nodes and both spatial and temporal connections as edges. To operate on this graphical structure, we propose Skeletal Graph Self-Attention (SGSA), a novel graphical attention layer that embeds a skeleton inductive bias into the SLP model. Retaining the skeletal feature representation throughout, we directly apply a spatio-temporal adjacency matrix into the self-attention formulation. This provides structure and context to each skeletal joint that is not possible when using a non-graphical abstract representation, enabling fluid and expressive sign language production. We evaluate our Skeletal Graph Self-Attention architecture on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T(PHOENIX14T) dataset, achieving state-of-the-art back translation performance with an 8% and 7% improvement over competing methods for the dev and test sets."
69,acl,2020,Data Manipulation: Towards Effective Instance Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation via Learning to Augment and Reweight,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.564,"Current state-of-the-art neural dialogue models learn from human conversations following the data-driven paradigm. As such, a reliable training corpus is the crux of building a robust and well-behaved dialogue model. However, due to the open-ended nature of human conversations, the quality of user-generated training data varies greatly, and effective training samples are typically insufficient while noisy samples frequently appear. This impedes the learning of those data-driven neural dialogue models. Therefore, effective dialogue learning requires not only more reliable learning samples, but also fewer noisy samples. In this paper, we propose a data manipulation framework to proactively reshape the data distribution towards reliable samples by augmenting and highlighting effective learning samples as well as reducing the effect of inefficient samples simultaneously. In particular, the data manipulation model selectively augments the training samples and assigns an importance weight to each instance to reform the training data. Note that, the proposed data manipulation framework is fully data-driven and learnable. It not only manipulates training samples to optimize the dialogue generation model, but also learns to increase its manipulation skills through gradient descent with validation samples. Extensive experiments show that our framework can improve the dialogue generation performance with respect to various automatic evaluation metrics and human judgments."

At each time step, our model performs multiple rounds of attention, reasoning, and composition that aim to answer two critical questions: (1) which part of the input \textit{sequence} to abstract; and (2) where in the output \textit{graph} to construct the new concept. We show that the answers to these two questions are mutually causalities. We design a model based on iterative inference that helps achieve better answers in both perspectives, leading to greatly improved parsing accuracy. Our experimental results significantly outperform all previously reported \textsc{Smatch} scores by large margins. Remarkably, without the help of any large-scale pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT), our model already surpasses previous state-of-the-art using BERT. With the help of BERT, we can push the state-of-the-art results to 80.2\% on LDC2017T10 (AMR 2.0) and 75.4\% on LDC2014T12 (AMR 1.0)."

In order to address the issues above, we propose a Type Auxiliary Guiding encoder-decoder framework for the code comment generation task which considers the source code as an N-ary tree with type information associated with each node. Specifically, our framework is featured with a Type-associated Encoder and a Type-restricted Decoder which enables adaptive summarization of the source code. We further propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning method to resolve the training difficulties of our proposed framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework with both the auto-evaluated metrics and case studies."

This unpredictability, caused by the randomness of fatal crash incidents, reduces the accuracy of crash frequency (i.e., counts of fatal crashes per cluster) which is used to measure traffic safety in practice. In this paper, a quantitative measure of traffic safety that is not significantly affected by the aforementioned variability is proposed. It introduces a fatal point -- a segment with the highest frequency of fatality -- concept based on cluster characteristics and detects them by imposing rounding errors to the hundredth decimal place of the longitude. The frequencies of the cluster and the cluster's fatal point are combined to construct a low-sensitive quantitative measure of traffic safety for the cluster. The performance of the proposed measure of traffic safety is then studied by varying the parameter k of k-means clustering with the expectation that other clustering techniques can be adopted in a similar fashion. The 2015 North Carolina fatal crash dataset of Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) is used to evaluate the proposed fatal point concept and perform experimental analysis to determine the effectiveness of the proposed measure. The empirical study shows that the average traffic safety, measured by the proposed quantitative measure over several clusters, is not significantly affected by the variability, compared to that of the standard crash frequency."

Adversarial Generation of Inconsistent Natural Language Explanations,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.382,"Factual consistency is one of the most important requirements when editing high quality documents. It is extremely important for automatic text generation systems like summarization, question answering, dialog modeling, and language modeling. Still, automated factual inconsistency detection is rather under-studied. Existing work has focused on (a) finding fake news keeping a knowledge base in context, or (b) detecting broad contradiction (as part of natural language inference literature). However, there has been no work on detecting and explaining types of factual inconsistencies in text, without any knowledge base in context. In this paper, we leverage existing work in linguistics to formally define five types of factual inconsistencies. Based on this categorization, we contribute a novel dataset, FICLE (Factual Inconsistency CLassification with Explanation), with ~8K samples where each sample consists of two sentences (claim and context) annotated with type and span of inconsistency. When the inconsistency relates to an entity type, it is labeled as well at two levels (coarse and fine-grained). Further, we leverage this dataset to train a pipeline of four neural models to predict inconsistency type with explanations, given a (claim, context) sentence pair. Explanations include inconsistent claim fact triple, inconsistent context span, inconsistent claim component, coarse and fine-grained inconsistent entity types. The proposed system first predicts inconsistent spans from claim and context; and then uses them to predict inconsistency types and inconsistent entity types (when inconsistency is due to entities). We experiment with multiple Transformer-based natural language classification as well as generative models, and find that DeBERTa performs the best. Our proposed methods provide a weighted F1 of ~87% for inconsistency type classification across the five classes."

This paper proposes new zero-short transfer learning technique for dialogue state tracking where the in-domain training data are all synthesized from an abstract dialogue model and the ontology of the domain. We show that data augmentation through synthesized data can improve the accuracy of zero-shot learning for both the TRADE model and the BERT-based SUMBT model on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset. We show training with only synthesized in-domain data on the SUMBT model can reach about 2/3 of the accuracy obtained with the full training dataset. We improve the zero-shot learning state of the art on average across domains by 21%.

In real-world QA systems, Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) based QA is usually a practical and effective solution, especially for some complicated questions (e.g., How and Why). Recent years have witnessed the great successes of knowledge graphs (KGs) in KBQA systems, while there are still few works focusing on making full use of KGs in FAQ-based QA. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge Anchor based Question Answering (KAQA) framework for FAQ-based QA to better understand questions and retrieve more appropriate answers. More specifically, KAQA mainly consists of three modules: knowledge graph construction, query anchoring and query-document matching. We consider entities and triples of KGs in texts as knowledge anchors to precisely capture the core semantics, which brings in higher precision and better interpretability. The multi-channel matching strategy also enables most sentence matching models to be flexibly plugged in our KAQA framework to fit different real-world computation limitations. In experiments, we evaluate our models on both offline and online query-document matching tasks on a real-world FAQ-based QA system in WeChat Search, with detailed analysis, ablation tests and case studies. The significant improvements confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the KAQA framework in real-world FAQ-based QA."

However, manual coding by human coders is expensive and error-prone. Automatic ICD coding has the potential to solve this problem. With the advancement of deep learning technologies, many deep learning-based methods for automatic ICD coding are being developed. In particular, a label attention mechanism is effective for multi-label classification, i.e., the ICD coding. It effectively obtains the label-specific representations from the input clinical records. However, because the existing label attention mechanism finds key tokens in the entire text at once, the important information dispersed in each paragraph may be omitted from the attention map. To overcome this, we propose a novel neural network architecture composed of two parts of encoders and two kinds of label attention layers. The input text is segmentally encoded in the former encoder and integrated by the follower. Then, the conventional and partition-based label attention mechanisms extract important global and local feature representations. Our classifier effectively integrates them to enhance the ICD coding performance. We verified the proposed method using the MIMIC-III, a benchmark dataset of the ICD coding. Our results show that our network improves the ICD coding performance based on the partition-based mechanism."

These datasets establish strict definitions of the coreference relations across related tests but typically ignore anaphora with more vague context-dependent loose coreference relations. In this paper, we qualitatively and quantitatively compare the annotation schemes of ECB+, a CDCR dataset with identity coreference relations, and NewsWCL50, a CDCR dataset with a mix of loose context-dependent and strict coreference relations. We propose a phrasing diversity metric (PD) that encounters for the diversity of full phrases unlike the previously proposed metrics and allows to evaluate lexical diversity of the CDCR datasets in a higher precision. The analysis shows that coreference chains of NewsWCL50 are more lexically diverse than those of ECB+ but annotating of NewsWCL50 leads to the lower inter-coder reliability. We discuss the different tasks that both CDCR datasets create for the CDCR models, i.e., lexical disambiguation and lexical diversity. Finally, to ensure generalizability of the CDCR models, we propose a direction for CDCR evaluation that combines CDCR datasets with multiple annotation schemes that focus of various properties of the coreference chains."

When using a summarization system, users often have specific intents with various language realizations, which, depending on the information need, can range from a single keyword to a long narrative composed of multiple questions. Existing summarization systems, however, often either fail to support or act robustly on this query focused summarization task. We introduce LaQSum, the first unified text summarization system that learns Latent Queries from documents for abstractive summarization with any existing query forms. Under a deep generative framework, our system jointly optimizes a latent query model and a conditional language model, allowing users to plug-and-play queries of any type at test time. Despite learning from only generic summarization data and requiring no further optimization for downstream summarization tasks, our system robustly outperforms strong comparison systems across summarization benchmarks with different query types, document settings, and target domains."

This is a challenging task, unaddressed in previous work, as it requires the models to have expert intelligence in order to modify text with a deep understanding of domain knowledge and structures. We establish the benchmark performance of five state-of-the-art models for style transfer and text simplification. The results demonstrate a significant gap between machine and human performance. We also discuss the challenges of automatic evaluation, to provide insights into future research directions. The dataset is publicly available at https://srhthu.github.io/expertise-style-transfer."

Although the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) model could solve such problems to a certain extent, the development is still limited by its high algorithm complexity, slow convergence speed, and poor test robustness. Inspired by the learning and memory mechanism of the brain, this paper proposed a Memory Transformation based Differentiable Neural Computer (MT-DNC) model. MT-DNC incorporates working memory and long-term memory into DNC, and realizes the autonomous transformation of acquired experience between working memory and long-term memory, thereby helping to effectively extract acquired knowledge to improve reasoning ability. Experimental results on bAbI question answering task demonstrated that our proposed method achieves superior performance and faster convergence speed compared to other existing DNN and DNC models. Ablation studies also indicated that the memory transformation from working memory to long-term memory plays essential role in improving the robustness and stability of reasoning. This work explores how brain-inspired memory transformation can be integrated and applied to complex intelligent dialogue and reasoning systems."

We present an attentional convolutional network that predicts medical codes from clinical text.

The method is accurate, achieving precision@8 of 0.71 and a Micro-F1 of 0.54, which are both better than the prior state of the art.

Second, it has a real-world size -- 600 training, 310 dev, and 490 evaluation question/answer pairs -- thus reflecting the cost of creating large labeled datasets with actual data. Consequently, TechQA is meant to stimulate research in domain adaptation rather than being a resource to build QA systems from scratch. The dataset was obtained by crawling the IBM Developer and IBM DeveloperWorks forums for questions with accepted answers that appear in a published IBM Technote---a technical document that addresses a specific technical issue.

In this paper, we study whether the language emerging in deep multi-agent simulations possesses a similar ability to refer to novel primitive combinations, and whether it accomplishes this feat by strategies akin to human-language compositionality. Equipped with new ways to measure compositionality in emergent languages inspired by disentanglement in representation learning, we establish three main results. First, given sufficiently large input spaces, the emergent language will naturally develop the ability to refer to novel composite concepts. Second, there is no correlation between the degree of compositionality of an emergent language and its ability to generalize. Third, while compositionality is not necessary for generalization, it provides an advantage in terms of language transmission: The more compositional a language is, the more easily it will be picked up by new learners, even when the latter differ in architecture from the original agents. We conclude that compositionality does not arise from simple generalization pressure, but if an emergent language does chance upon it, it will be more likely to survive and thrive."

Indeed, trans-continental highways need particular attention due to their important role in sustaining globalization. In this context, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can actively enhance the safety, mobility, productivity, and comfort of trans-continental highways. However, ITS efficiency depends greatly on the roads where they are deployed, on the availability of power and connectivity, and on the integration of future connected and autonomous vehicles. To this end, high altitude platform station (HAPS) systems, due to their mobility, sustainability, payload capacity, and communication/caching/computing capabilities, are seen as a key enabler of future ITS services for trans-continental highways; this paradigm is referred to as HAPS-ITS. The latter is envisioned as an active component of ITS systems to support a plethora of transportation applications, such as traffic monitoring, accident reporting, and platooning. This paper discusses how HAPS systems can enable advanced ITS services for trans-continental highways, presenting the main requirements of HAPS-ITS and a detailed case study of the Trans-Sahara highway."

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to allow a learning agent to ask what it considers as tricky to predict, in the course of producing a final output. By analyzing when and what it asks, we can make our model more transparent and interpretable. We first develop this idea to propose a general framework of deep neural networks that can ask questions, which we call asking networks. A specific architecture and training process for an asking network is proposed for the task of colorization, which is an exemplar one-to-many task and thus a task where asking questions is helpful in performing the task accurately. Our results show that the model learns to generate meaningful questions, asks difficult questions first, and utilizes the provided hint more efficiently than baseline models. We conclude that the proposed asking framework makes the learning agent reveal its weaknesses, which poses a promising new direction in developing interpretable and interactive models."

While prior works on sarcasm generation predominantly focus on context incongruity, we show that combining valence reversal and semantic incongruity based on the commonsense knowledge generates sarcasm of higher quality.

They typically contain user descriptions of the problem, the setup, and steps for attempted resolution. Often they also contain various non-natural language text elements like outputs of commands, snippets of code, error messages or stack traces. These elements contain potentially crucial information for problem resolution. However, they cannot be correctly parsed by tools designed for natural language. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation for technical support questions. We formulate the problem as a sequence labelling task, and study the performance of state of the art approaches. We compare this against an intuitive contextual sentence-level classification baseline, and a state of the art supervised text-segmentation approach. We also introduce a novel component of combining contextual embeddings from multiple language models pre-trained on different data sources, which achieves a marked improvement over using embeddings from a single pre-trained language model. Finally, we also demonstrate the usefulness of such segmentation with improvements on the downstream task of answer retrieval."

A Multi-task Learning Framework for Multi-Modal Sarcasm, Sentiment and Emotion Analysis",https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.401,"Sarcasm, sentiment, and emotion are three typical kinds of spontaneous affective responses of humans to external events and they are tightly intertwined with each other. Such events may be expressed in multiple modalities (e.g., linguistic, visual and acoustic), e.g., multi-modal conversations. Joint analysis of humans' multi-modal sarcasm, sentiment, and emotion is an important yet challenging topic, as it is a complex cognitive process involving both cross-modality interaction and cross-affection correlation. From the probability theory perspective, cross-affection correlation also means that the judgments on sarcasm, sentiment, and emotion are incompatible. However, this exposed phenomenon cannot be sufficiently modelled by classical probability theory due to its assumption of compatibility. Neither do the existing approaches take it into consideration. In view of the recent success of quantum probability (QP) in modeling human cognition, particularly contextual incompatible decision making, we take the first step towards introducing QP into joint multi-modal sarcasm, sentiment, and emotion analysis. Specifically, we propose a QUantum probabIlity driven multi-modal sarcasm, sEntiment and emoTion analysis framework, termed QUIET. Extensive experiments on two datasets and the results show that the effectiveness and advantages of QUIET in comparison with a wide range of the state-of-the-art baselines. We also show the great potential of QP in multi-affect analysis."
92,acl,2020,Parallel Sentence Mining by Constrained Decoding,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.152,"Language style transfer is the problem of migrating the content of a source sentence to a target style. In many of its applications, parallel training data are not available and source sentences to be transferred may have arbitrary and unknown styles. First, each sentence is encoded into its content and style latent representations. Then, by recombining the content with the target style, we decode a sentence aligned in the target domain. To adequately constrain the encoding and decoding functions, we couple them with two loss functions. The first is a style discrepancy loss, enforcing that the style representation accurately encodes the style information guided by the discrepancy between the sentence style and the target style. The second is a cycle consistency loss, which ensures that the transferred sentence should preserve the content of the original sentence disentangled from its style. We validate the effectiveness of our model in three tasks: sentiment modification of restaurant reviews, dialog response revision with a romantic style, and sentence rewriting with a Shakespearean style."

At training, our novel multi-level learning-to-rank loss compares positive types against negative siblings according to the type tree. During prediction, we define a coarse-to-fine decoder that restricts viable candidates at each level of the ontology based on already predicted parent type(s). We achieve state-of-the-art across multiple datasets, particularly with respect to strict accuracy."
94,acl,2020,Exclusive Hierarchical Decoding for Deep Keyphrase Generation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.103,"Keyphrase generation (KG) aims to summarize the main ideas of a document into a set of keyphrases. A new setting is recently introduced into this problem, in which, given a document, the model needs to predict a set of keyphrases and simultaneously determine the appropriate number of keyphrases to produce. Previous work in this setting employs a sequential decoding process to generate keyphrases. However, such a decoding method ignores the intrinsic hierarchical compositionality existing in the keyphrase set of a document. Moreover, previous work tends to generate duplicated keyphrases, which wastes time and computing resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose an exclusive hierarchical decoding framework that includes a hierarchical decoding process and either a soft or a hard exclusion mechanism. The hierarchical decoding process is to explicitly model the hierarchical compositionality of a keyphrase set. Both the soft and the hard exclusion mechanisms keep track of previously-predicted keyphrases within a window size to enhance the diversity of the generated keyphrases. Extensive experiments on multiple KG benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to generate less duplicated and more accurate keyphrases."
95,acl,2020,Logical Natural Language Generation from Open-Domain Tables,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.708,"Logical table-to-text generation is a task that involves generating logically faithful sentences from tables, which requires models to derive logical level facts from table records via logical inference. It raises a new challenge on the logical-level content planning of table-to-text models. However, directly learning the logical inference knowledge from table-text pairs is very difficult for neural models because of the ambiguity of natural language and the scarcity of parallel data. Hence even large-scale pre-trained language models present low logical fidelity on logical table-to-text. In this work, we propose a PLOG (Pretrained Logical Form Generator) framework to improve the generation fidelity. Specifically, PLOG is first pretrained on a table-to-logic-form generation (table-to-logic) task, then finetuned on downstream table-to-text tasks. The formal definition of logical forms enables us to collect large amount of accurate logical forms from tables without human annotation. In addition, PLOG can learn logical inference from table-logic pairs much more definitely than from table-text pairs. To evaluate our model, we further collect a controlled logical table-to-text dataset CONTLOG based on an existing dataset. On two benchmarks, LOGICNLG and CONTLOG, PLOG outperforms strong baselines by a large margin on the logical fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of table-to-logic pretraining."
96,acl,2020,Towards Interpretable Clinical Diagnosis with Bayesian Network Ensembles Stacked on Entity-Aware CNNs,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.286,"Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes 15% of childhood mortality, over 800,000 children under five every year, all over the world. This pathology is mainly caused by viruses or bacteria. X-rays imaging analysis is one of the most used methods for pneumonia diagnosis. These clinical images can be analyzed using machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which learn to extract critical features for the classification. However, the usability of these systems is limited in medicine due to the lack of interpretability, because of these models cannot be used to generate an understandable explanation (from a human-based perspective), about how they have reached those results. Another problem that difficults the impact of this technology is the limited amount of labeled data in many medicine domains. The main contributions of this work are two fold: the first one is the design of a new explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique based on combining the individual heatmaps obtained from each model in the ensemble. This allows to overcome the explainability and interpretability problems of the CNN ""black boxes"", highlighting those areas of the image which are more relevant to generate the classification. The second one is the development of new ensemble deep learning models to classify chest X-rays that allow highly competitive results using small datasets for training. We tested our ensemble model using a small dataset of pediatric X-rays (950 samples) with low quality and anatomical variability (which represents one of the biggest challenges). We also tested other strategies such as single CNNs trained from scratch and transfer learning using CheXNet. Our results show that our ensemble model outperforms these strategies obtaining highly competitive results. Finally, we confirmed the robustness of our approach using another pneumonia diagnosis dataset [1]."

Despite the recent success of neural approaches for NLG, they are typically developed for particular domains with rich annotated training examples. In this paper, we study NLG in a low-resource setting to generate sentences in new scenarios with handful training examples. We formulate the problem from a meta-learning perspective, and propose a generalized optimization-based approach (Meta-NLG) based on the well-recognized model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm. Meta-NLG defines a set of meta tasks, and directly incorporates the objective of adapting to new low-resource NLG tasks into the meta-learning optimization process. Extensive experiments are conducted on a large multi-domain dataset (MultiWoz) with diverse linguistic variations. We show that Meta-NLG significantly outperforms other training procedures in various low-resource configurations. We analyze the results, and demonstrate that Meta-NLG adapts extremely fast and well to low-resource situations."

However, it remains an open question how to utilize BERT for language generation. In this paper, we present a novel approach, Conditional Masked Language Modeling (C-MLM), to enable the finetuning of BERT on target generation tasks. The finetuned BERT (teacher) is exploited as extra supervision to improve conventional Seq2Seq models (student) for better text generation performance. By leveraging BERT's idiosyncratic bidirectional nature, distilling knowledge learned in BERT can encourage auto-regressive Seq2Seq models to plan ahead, imposing global sequence-level supervision for coherent text generation. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms strong Transformer baselines on multiple language generation tasks such as machine translation and text summarization. Our proposed model also achieves new state of the art on IWSLT German-English and English-Vietnamese MT datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/ChenRocks/Distill-BERT-Textgen."

While it has been shown that capsule networks are effective for image classification, their validity in the domain of text has not been explored. In this paper, we show that capsule networks indeed have the potential for text classification and that they have several advantages over convolutional neural networks. We further suggest a simple routing method that effectively reduces the computational complexity of dynamic routing. We utilized seven benchmark datasets to demonstrate that capsule networks, along with the proposed routing method provide comparable results."

This pointwise-based evaluation method does not match well the objective of most real world applications, so the goal of our work is to understand how models which perform well under pointwise evaluation may fail in practice and find better methods for evaluating paraphrase identification models. As a first step towards that goal, we show that although the standard way of fine-tuning BERT for paraphrase identification by pairing two sentences as one sequence results in a model with state-of-the-art performance, that model may perform poorly on simple tasks like identifying pairs with two identical sentences. Moreover, we show that these models may even predict a pair of randomly-selected sentences with higher paraphrase score than a pair of identical ones."

We demonstrate the feasibility of collecting annotations for UNLI by relabeling a portion of the SNLI dataset under a probabilistic scale, where items even with the same categorical label differ in how likely people judge them to be true given a premise. We describe a direct scalar regression modeling approach, and find that existing categorically labeled NLI data can be used in pre-training. Our best models approach human performance, demonstrating models may be capable of more subtle inferences than the categorical bin assignment employed in current NLI tasks."

In this paper, we consider the problem of \textit{shifted label distribution}, which is caused by the inconsistency between the noisy-labeled training set subject to external knowledge graph and the human-annotated test set, and exacerbated by the pipelined entity-then-relation extraction manner with noise propagation. We propose a joint extraction approach to address this problem by re-labeling noisy instances with a group of cooperative multiagents. To handle noisy instances in a fine-grained manner, each agent in the cooperative group evaluates the instance by calculating a continuous confidence score from its own perspective; To leverage the correlations between these two extraction tasks, a confidence consensus module is designed to gather the wisdom of all agents and re-distribute the noisy training set with confidence-scored labels. Further, the confidences are used to adjust the training losses of extractors. Experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the benefits of re-labeling noisy instance, and show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art entity and relation extraction methods."

This study introduces a new method for predicting the future state of synchronization of the dynamics of two financial time series. To this end, we use the cross-recurrence plot analysis as a nonlinear method for quantifying the multidimensional coupling in the time domain of two time series and for determining their state of synchronization. We adopt a deep learning framework for methodologically addressing the prediction of the synchronization state based on features extracted from dynamically sub-sampled cross-recurrence plots. We provide extensive experiments on several stocks, major constituents of the S\&P100 index, to empirically validate our approach. We find that the task of predicting the state of synchronization of two time series is in general rather difficult, but for certain pairs of stocks attainable with very satisfactory performance."

TSPRA combines topics (i.e. product aspects), word sentiment and user preference as regression factors, and is able to perform topic clustering, review rating prediction, sentiment analysis and what we invent as ""critical aspect"" analysis altogether in one framework. TSPRA extends sentiment approaches by integrating the key concept ""user preference"" in collaborative filtering (CF) models into consideration, while it is distinct from current CF models by decoupling ""user preference"" and ""sentiment"" as independent factors. Our experiments conducted on 22 Amazon datasets show overwhelming better performance in rating predication against a state-of-art model FLAME (2015) in terms of error, Pearson's Correlation and number of inverted pairs. For sentiment analysis, we compare the derived word sentiments against a public sentiment resource SenticNet3 and our sentiment estimations clearly make more sense in the context of online reviews. Last, as a result of the de-correlation of ""user preference"" from ""sentiment"", TSPRA is able to evaluate a new concept ""critical aspects"", defined as the product aspects seriously concerned by users but negatively commented in reviews. Improvement to such ""critical aspects"" could be most effective to enhance user experience."

Adversarial training has previously been shown to be effective for training cross-lingual sentence classifiers. However, it is not clear if language-agnostic representations enforced by an adversarial language discriminator will also enable effective transfer for token-level prediction tasks. Therefore, we experiment with different types of adversarial training on two tasks: dependency parsing and sentence compression. We show that adversarial training consistently leads to improved cross-lingual performance on each task compared to a conventionally trained baseline."

AMR parsing converts natural language sentences into such graphs. However, evaluating a parser on new data by means of comparison to manually created AMR graphs is very costly. Also, we would like to be able to detect parses of questionable quality, or preferring results of alternative systems by selecting the ones for which we can assess good quality. We propose AMR accuracy prediction as the task of predicting several metrics of correctness for an automatically generated AMR parse - in absence of the corresponding gold parse. We develop a neural end-to-end multi-output regression model and perform three case studies: firstly, we evaluate the model's capacity of predicting AMR parse accuracies and test whether it can reliably assign high scores to gold parses. Secondly, we perform parse selection based on predicted parse accuracies of candidate parses from alternative systems, with the aim of improving overall results. Finally, we predict system ranks for submissions from two AMR shared tasks on the basis of their predicted parse accuracy averages. All experiments are carried out across two different domains and show that our method is effective."

In contrast, document-level sentiment data with ratings are more easily accessible. In this work, we achieve zero-shot aspect-level sentiment classification by only using document-level reviews. Our key intuition is that the sentiment representation of a document is composed of the sentiment representations of all the aspects of that document. Based on this, we propose the AF-DSC method to explicitly model such sentiment composition in reviews. AF-DSC first learns sentiment representations for all potential aspects and then aggregates aspect-level sentiments into a document-level one to perform document-level sentiment classification. In this way, we obtain the aspect-level sentiment classifier as the by-product of the document-level sentiment classifier. Experimental results on aspect-level sentiment classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of explicit utilization of sentiment composition in document-level sentiment classification. Our model with only 30k training data outperforms previous work utilizing millions of data."

Chinese characters are composed of graphical components, which carry rich semantics. It is common for a Chinese learner to comprehend the meaning of a word from these graphical components. As a result, we propose models that enhance word representations by character glyphs. The character glyph features are directly learned from the bitmaps of characters by convolutional auto-encoder(convAE), and the glyph features improve Chinese word representations which are already enhanced by character embeddings. Another contribution in this paper is that we created several evaluation datasets in traditional Chinese and made them public."

DoubleMix first leverages a couple of simple augmentation operations to generate several perturbed samples for each training data, and then uses the perturbed data and original data to carry out a two-step interpolation in the hidden space of neural models. Concretely, it first mixes up the perturbed data to a synthetic sample and then mixes up the original data and the synthetic perturbed data. DoubleMix enhances models' robustness by learning the ""shifted"" features in hidden space. On six text classification benchmark datasets, our approach outperforms several popular text augmentation methods including token-level, sentence-level, and hidden-level data augmentation techniques. Also, experiments in low-resource settings show our approach consistently improves models' performance when the training data is scarce. Extensive ablation studies and case studies confirm that each component of our approach contributes to the final performance and show that our approach exhibits superior performance on challenging counterexamples. Additionally, visual analysis shows that text features generated by our approach are highly interpretable. Our code for this paper can be found at https://github.com/declare-lab/DoubleMix.git."

In natural language processing, existing methods usually provide important features which are words or phrases selected from an input text as an explanation, but ignore the interactions between them. It poses challenges for humans to interpret an explanation and connect it to model prediction. In this work, we build hierarchical explanations by detecting feature interactions. Such explanations visualize how words and phrases are combined at different levels of the hierarchy, which can help users understand the decision-making of black-box models. The proposed method is evaluated with three neural text classifiers (LSTM, CNN, and BERT) on two benchmark datasets, via both automatic and human evaluations. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing explanations that are both faithful to models and interpretable to humans."

Here we introduce HowNet as an external knowledge base and propose a Linguistic knowledge Enhanced graph Transformer (LET) to deal with word ambiguity. Additionally, we adopt the word lattice graph as input to maintain multi-granularity information. Our model is also complementary to pre-trained language models. Experimental results on two Chinese datasets show that our models outperform various typical text matching approaches. Ablation study also indicates that both semantic information and multi-granularity information are important for text matching modeling."

However, the discrete nature of natural language makes the disentangling of textual representations more challenging (e.g., the manipulation over the data space cannot be easily achieved). Inspired by information theory, we propose a novel method that effectively manifests disentangled representations of text, without any supervision on semantics. A new mutual information upper bound is derived and leveraged to measure dependence between style and content. By minimizing this upper bound, the proposed method induces style and content embeddings into two independent low-dimensional spaces. Experiments on both conditional text generation and text-style transfer demonstrate the high quality of our disentangled representation in terms of content and style preservation."

The model builds a graph over the characters, and SpellGCN is learned to map this graph into a set of inter-dependent character classifiers. These classifiers are applied to the representations extracted by another network, such as BERT, enabling the whole network to be end-to-end trainable.

To better understand this overlap, we extend recent work on finding syntactic trees in neural networks' internal representations to the multilingual setting. We show that subspaces of mBERT representations recover syntactic tree distances in languages other than English, and that these subspaces are approximately shared across languages. Motivated by these results, we present an unsupervised analysis method that provides evidence mBERT learns representations of syntactic dependency labels, in the form of clusters which largely agree with the Universal Dependencies taxonomy. This evidence suggests that even without explicit supervision, multilingual masked language models learn certain linguistic universals."

In this paper, we propose a Semantic Modular Model (SMM) consisting of 5 different modules, namely Distributional Denoising Autoencoder, Incremental Clustering, Semantic Denoising, Defragmentation, and Ranking and Processing. The proposed model aims to (1) cluster various documents and ignore the documents that might not contribute to the identification of events, (2) identify more important and descriptive keywords. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the results show that the proposed model has a higher performance in identifying events with lower ranks and extracting keywords for more important events in three English Twitter datasets: FACup, SuperTuesday, and USElection.

Our text-level discourse parser is trained using gold segmentation and is built upon the DPLP discourse parser, which uses a large-margin transition-based approach to solve the problem of discourse parsing. The performance of our discourse parser in span (S), nuclearity (N) and relation (R) detection is around 78%, 64%, 44% respectively, in terms of F1 measure."
124,acl,2020,Cross-Lingual Disaster-related Multi-label Tweet Classification with Manifold Mixup,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-srw.39,Modern handwritten text recognition techniques employ deep recurrent neural networks. The use of these techniques is especially efficient when a large amount of annotated data is available for parameter estimation. Data augmentation can be used to enhance the performance of the systems when data is scarce. Manifold Mixup is a modern method of data augmentation that meld two images or the feature maps corresponding to these images and the targets are fused accordingly. We propose to apply the Manifold Mixup to text recognition while adapting it to work with a Connectionist Temporal Classification cost. We show that Manifold Mixup improves text recognition results on various languages and datasets.
125,acl,2020,Analyzing analytical methods: The case of phonology in neural models of spoken language,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.381,"Given the fast development of analysis techniques for NLP and speech processing systems, few systematic studies have been conducted to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each method. As a step in this direction we study the case of representations of phonology in neural network models of spoken language. We use two commonly applied analytical techniques, diagnostic classifiers and representational similarity analysis, to quantify to what extent neural activation patterns encode phonemes and phoneme sequences. We manipulate two factors that can affect the outcome of analysis. First, we investigate the role of learning by comparing neural activations extracted from trained versus randomly-initialized models. Second, we examine the temporal scope of the activations by probing both local activations corresponding to a few milliseconds of the speech signal, and global activations pooled over the whole utterance. We conclude that reporting analysis results with randomly initialized models is crucial, and that global-scope methods tend to yield more consistent results and we recommend their use as a complement to local-scope diagnostic methods."

Leveraging Word Embedding as Intermediate in Multitask End-to-End Speech Translation",https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.533,"Speech translation (ST) aims to learn transformations from speech in the source language to the text in the target language. Previous works show that multitask learning improves the ST performance, in which the recognition decoder generates the text of the source language, and the translation decoder obtains the final translations based on the output of the recognition decoder. Because whether the output of the recognition decoder has the correct semantics is more critical than its accuracy, we propose to improve the multitask ST model by utilizing word embedding as the intermediate."
127,acl,2020,Improved Speech Representations with Multi-Target Autoregressive Predictive Coding,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.213,"Training objectives based on predictive coding have recently been shown to be very effective at learning meaningful representations from unlabeled speech. One example is Autoregressive Predictive Coding (Chung et al., 2019), which trains an autoregressive RNN to generate an unseen future frame given a context such as recent past frames. The basic hypothesis of these approaches is that hidden states that can accurately predict future frames are a useful representation for many downstream tasks. In this paper we extend this hypothesis and aim to enrich the information encoded in the hidden states by training the model to make more accurate future predictions. We propose an auxiliary objective that serves as a regularization to improve generalization of the future frame prediction task. Experimental results on phonetic classification, speech recognition, and speech translation not only support the hypothesis, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning representations that contain richer phonetic content."

The linguistic structure of a referring expression provides a layout of reasoning over the visual contents, and it is often crucial to align and jointly understand the image and the referring expression. In this paper, we propose a scene graph guided modular network (SGMN), which performs reasoning over a semantic graph and a scene graph with neural modules under the guidance of the linguistic structure of the expression. In particular, we model the image as a structured semantic graph, and parse the expression into a language scene graph. The language scene graph not only decodes the linguistic structure of the expression, but also has a consistent representation with the image semantic graph. In addition to exploring structured solutions to grounding referring expressions, we also propose Ref-Reasoning, a large-scale real-world dataset for structured referring expression reasoning. We automatically generate referring expressions over the scene graphs of images using diverse expression templates and functional programs. This dataset is equipped with real-world visual contents as well as semantically rich expressions with different reasoning layouts. Experimental results show that our SGMN not only significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on the new Ref-Reasoning dataset, but also surpasses state-of-the-art structured methods on commonly used benchmark datasets. It can also provide interpretable visual evidences of reasoning. Data and code are available at https://github.com/sibeiyang/sgmn"
129,acl,2020,SPECTER: Document-level Representation Learning using Citation-informed Transformers,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.207,"When a three-dimensional object moves relative to an observer, a change occurs on the observer's image plane and in the visual representation computed by a learned model. Starting with the idea that a good visual representation is one that transforms linearly under scene motions, we show, using the theory of group representations, that any such representation is equivalent to a combination of the elementary irreducible representations. We derive a striking relationship between irreducibility and the statistical dependency structure of the representation, by showing that under restricted conditions, irreducible representations are decorrelated. Under partial observability, as induced by the perspective projection of a scene onto the image plane, the motion group does not have a linear action on the space of images, so that it becomes necessary to perform inference over a latent representation that does transform linearly. This idea is demonstrated in a model of rotating NORB objects that employs a latent representation of the non-commutative 3D rotation group SO(3)."

The difference between perplexity estimates from two neural language models (LMs) - one trained on transcripts of speech produced by healthy participants and the other trained on transcripts from patients with dementia - as a single feature for diagnostic classification of unseen transcripts has been shown to produce state-of-the-art performance. However, little is known about why this approach is effective, and on account of the lack of case/control matching in the most widely-used evaluation set of transcripts (DementiaBank), it is unclear if these approaches are truly diagnostic, or are sensitive to other variables. In this paper, we interrogate neural LMs trained on participants with and without dementia using synthetic narratives previously developed to simulate progressive semantic dementia by manipulating lexical frequency. We find that perplexity of neural LMs is strongly and differentially associated with lexical frequency, and that a mixture model resulting from interpolating control and dementia LMs improves upon the current state-of-the-art for models trained on transcript text exclusively."

However, unsupervised learning of complex data is challenging, and even the best approaches show much weaker performance than their supervised counterparts. Self-supervised deep learning has become a strong instrument for representation learning in computer vision. However, those methods have not been evaluated in a fully unsupervised setting. In this paper, we propose a simple scheme for unsupervised classification based on self-supervised representations. We evaluate the proposed approach with several recent self-supervised methods showing that it achieves competitive results for ImageNet classification (39% accuracy on ImageNet with 1000 clusters and 46% with overclustering). We suggest adding the unsupervised evaluation to a set of standard benchmarks for self-supervised learning. The code is available at https://github.com/Randl/kmeans_selfsuper"

The problem exacerbates with cross-lingual EL which involves linking mentions written in non-English documents to entries in the English Wikipedia: to compare textual clues across languages we need to compute similarity between textual fragments across languages. In this paper, we propose a neural EL model that trains fine-grained similarities and dissimilarities between the query and candidate document from multiple perspectives, combined with convolution and tensor networks. Further, we show that this English-trained system can be applied, in zero-shot learning, to other languages by making surprisingly effective use of multi-lingual embeddings. The proposed system has strong empirical evidence yielding state-of-the-art results in English as well as cross-lingual: Spanish and Chinese TAC 2015 datasets."

This formulation allows for a simple integration of conversational knowledge coded in large pretrained conversational models such as ConveRT (Henderson et al., 2019). We show that leveraging such knowledge in Span-ConveRT is especially useful for few-shot learning scenarios: we report consistent gains over 1) a span extractor that trains representations from scratch in the target domain, and 2) a BERT-based span extractor. In order to inspire more work on span extraction for the slot-filling task, we also release RESTAURANTS-8K, a new challenging data set of 8,198 utterances, compiled from actual conversations in the restaurant booking domain."

Existing works for disfluency detection have focused on designing a single objective only for disfluency detection, while auxiliary objectives utilizing linguistic information of a word such as named entity or part-of-speech information can be effective. In this paper, we focus on detecting disfluencies on spoken transcripts and propose a method utilizing named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) as auxiliary sequence labeling (SL) tasks for disfluency detection. First, we investigate cases that utilizing linguistic information of a word can prevent mispredicting important words and can be helpful for the correct detection of disfluencies. Second, we show that training a disfluency detection model with auxiliary SL tasks can improve its F-score in disfluency detection. Then, we analyze which auxiliary SL tasks are influential depending on baseline models. Experimental results on the widely used English Switchboard dataset show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in disfluency detection."

To defend against these attacks, most existing methods apply adversarial training by incorporating adversarial examples. However, these methods have to rely on ground-truth labels to generate adversarial examples, rendering it impractical for large-scale model pre-training which is commonly used nowadays for NLP and many other tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called SCAT (Self-supervised Contrastive Learning via Adversarial Training), which can learn robust representations without requiring labeled data. Specifically, SCAT modifies random augmentations of the data in a fully labelfree manner to generate adversarial examples. Adversarial training is achieved by minimizing the contrastive loss between the augmentations and their adversarial counterparts. We evaluate SCAT on two text classification datasets using two state-of-the-art attack schemes proposed recently. Our results show that SCAT can not only train robust language models from scratch, but it can also significantly improve the robustness of existing pre-trained language models. Moreover, to demonstrate its flexibility, we show that SCAT can also be combined with supervised adversarial training to further enhance model robustness."

A deep learning system can learn to generate poetry on its own by training on a corpus of poems and modeling the particular style of language. In this paper, we propose taking an approach that fine-tunes GPT-2, a pre-trained language model, to our downstream task of poetry generation. We extend prior work on poetry generation by introducing creative elements. Specifically, we generate poems that express emotion and elicit the same in readers, and poems that use the language of dreams---called dream poetry. We are able to produce poems that correctly elicit the emotions of sadness and joy 87.5 and 85 percent, respectively, of the time. We produce dreamlike poetry by training on a corpus of texts that describe dreams. Poems from this model are shown to capture elements of dream poetry with scores of no less than 3.2 on the Likert scale. We perform crowdsourced human-evaluation for all our poems. We also make use of the Coh-Metrix tool, outlining metrics we use to gauge the quality of text generated."

Common practice has been to treat it as a problem of classifying dialogue content into a set of pre-defined slot-value pairs, or generating values for different slots given the dialogue history. Both have limitations on considering dependencies that occur on dialogues, and are lacking of reasoning capabilities. This paper proposes to track dialogue states gradually with reasoning over dialogue turns with the help of the back-end data.

Conventional sequence tagging techniques encode Markov assumptions that are efficient but preclude recovery of these mentions.

Through extensive experiments on three biomedical data sets, we show that our model can effectively recognize discontinuous mentions without sacrificing the accuracy on continuous mentions."

Popular approaches in learning dialog policy with RL include letting a dialog agent to learn against a user simulator. Building a reliable user simulator, however, is not trivial, often as difficult as building a good dialog agent. We address this challenge by jointly optimizing the dialog agent and the user simulator with deep RL by simulating dialogs between the two agents. We first bootstrap a basic dialog agent and a basic user simulator by learning directly from dialog corpora with supervised training. We then improve them further by letting the two agents to conduct task-oriented dialogs and iteratively optimizing their policies with deep RL. Both the dialog agent and the user simulator are designed with neural network models that can be trained end-to-end. Our experiment results show that the proposed method leads to promising improvements on task success rate and total task reward comparing to supervised training and single-agent RL training baseline models."

These could be eliminated by using character-level features. We propose a novel end-to-end Arabic document classification framework, Arabic document image-based classifier (AraDIC), inspired by the work on image-based character embeddings. AraDIC consists of an image-based character encoder and a classifier. They are trained in an end-to-end fashion using the class balanced loss to deal with the long-tailed data distribution problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of AraDIC, we created and published two datasets, the Arabic Wikipedia title (AWT) dataset and the Arabic poetry (AraP) dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first image-based character embedding framework addressing the problem of Arabic text classification. We also present the first deep learning-based text classifier widely evaluated on modern standard Arabic, colloquial Arabic and classical Arabic. AraDIC shows performance improvement over classical and deep learning baselines by 12.29% and 23.05% for the micro and macro F-score, respectively."

Our work uses ambiguous relative clause attachment to extend such evaluations to cases of multiple simultaneous valid interpretations, where stark grammaticality differences are absent. We compare model performance in English and Spanish to show that non-linguistic biases in RNN LMs advantageously overlap with syntactic structure in English but not Spanish. Thus, English models may appear to acquire human-like syntactic preferences, while models trained on Spanish fail to acquire comparable human-like preferences. We conclude by relating these results to broader concerns about the relationship between comprehension (i.e. typical language model use cases) and production (which generates the training data for language models), suggesting that necessary linguistic biases are not present in the training signal at all."

Even we limit ourselves to the political context in the legislative processes; we need a better understanding of latent factors, such as legislators, bills, their ideal points, and their relations. From the modeling perspective, this is difficult 1) because these observations lie in a high dimension that requires learning on low dimensional representations, and 2) because these observations require complex probabilistic modeling with latent variables to reflect the causalities. This paper presents a new model to reflect and understand this political setting, NIPEN, including factors mentioned above in the legislation. We propose two versions of NIPEN: one is a hybrid model of deep learning and probabilistic graphical model, and the other model is a neural tensor model. Our result indicates that NIPEN successfully learns the manifold of the legislative bill texts, and NIPEN utilizes the learned low-dimensional latent variables to increase the prediction performance of legislators' votings. Additionally, by virtue of being a domain-rich probabilistic model, NIPEN shows the hidden strength of the legislators' trust network and their various characteristics on casting votes."

Using 19th-century newspapers as a case study, we extend the time-masking approach proposed by Rosin et al., 2022 and compare different strategies for inserting temporal, political and geographical information into a Masked Language Model. After fine-tuning several DistilBERT on enhanced input data, we provide a systematic evaluation of these models on a set of evaluation tasks: pseudo-perplexity, metadata mask-filling and supervised classification. We find that showing relevant metadata to a language model has a beneficial impact and may even produce more robust and fairer models."

This limitation has increased interest in designing more interpretable deep models for NLP that reveal the `reasoning' behind model outputs. But work in this direction has been conducted on different datasets and tasks with correspondingly unique aims and metrics; this makes it difficult to track progress. We propose the Evaluating Rationales And Simple English Reasoning (ERASER) benchmark to advance research on interpretable models in NLP. This benchmark comprises multiple datasets and tasks for which human annotations of ""rationales"" (supporting evidence) have been collected. We propose several metrics that aim to capture how well the rationales provided by models align with human rationales, and also how faithful these rationales are (i.e., the degree to which provided rationales influenced the corresponding predictions). Our hope is that releasing this benchmark facilitates progress on designing more interpretable NLP systems. The benchmark, code, and documentation are available at https://www.eraserbenchmark.com/"

The dot-product distance metric forms part of the inductive bias of NNLMs. Although NNLMs optimize well with this inductive bias, we show that this results in a sub-optimal ordering of the embedding space that structurally impoverishes some words at the expense of others when assigning probability. We present numerical, theoretical and empirical analyses showing that words on the interior of the convex hull in the embedding space have their probability bounded by the probabilities of the words on the hull."

Its automatic analysis has there-fore many applications, e.g., human-machine interface. In this paper, we propose an emotional tonal speech dataset, namely Mandarin Chinese Emotional Speech Dataset - Portrayed (MES-P), with both distal and proximal labels. In contrast with state of the art emotional speech datasets which are only focused on perceived emotions, the proposed MES-P dataset includes not only perceived emotions with their proximal labels but also intended emotions with distal labels, thereby making it possible to study human emotional intelligence, i.e. people emotion expression ability and their skill of understanding emotions, thus explicitly accounting for perception differences between intended and perceived emotions in speech signals and enabling studies of emotional misunderstandings which often occur in real life. Furthermore, the proposed MES-P dataset also captures a main feature of tonal languages, i.e., tonal variations, and provides recorded emotional speech samples whose tonal variations match the tonal distribution in real life Mandarin Chinese. Besides, the proposed MES-P dataset features emotion intensity variations as well, and includes both moderate and intense versions of recordings for joy, anger, and sadness in addition to neutral speech. Ratings of the collected speech samples are made in valence-arousal space through continuous coordinate locations, resulting in an emotional distribution pattern in 2D VA space. The consistency between the speakers' emotional intentions and the listeners' perceptions is also studied using Cohen's Kappa coefficients. Finally, we also carry out extensive experiments using a baseline on MES-P for automatic emotion recognition and compare the results with human emotion intelligence."

For this, we introduce an intermediate representation that is based on the logical query plan in a database called Operation Trees (OT). This representation allows us to invert the annotation process without losing flexibility in the types of queries that we generate. Furthermore, it allows for fine-grained alignment of query tokens to OT operations. In our method, we randomly generate OTs from a context-free grammar. Afterwards, annotators have to write the appropriate natural language question that is represented by the OT. Finally, the annotators assign the tokens to the OT operations. We apply the method to create a new corpus OTTA (Operation Trees and Token Assignment), a large semantic parsing corpus for evaluating natural language interfaces to databases. We compare OTTA to Spider and LC-QuaD 2.0 and show that our methodology more than triples the annotation speed while maintaining the complexity of the queries. Finally, we train a state-of-the-art semantic parsing model on our data and show that our corpus is a challenging dataset and that the token alignment can be leveraged to increase the performance significantly."

People have recently taken to social media websites (e.g., Twitter) to share their sentiments and feelings with the larger community. Consequently, these platforms have become instrumental in understanding and perceiving emotions at scale. In this paper, we introduce HurricaneEmo, an emotion dataset of 15,000 English tweets spanning three hurricanes: Harvey, Irma, and Maria. We present a comprehensive study of fine-grained emotions and propose classification tasks to discriminate between coarse-grained emotion groups. Our best BERT model, even after task-guided pre-training which leverages unlabeled Twitter data, achieves only 68% accuracy (averaged across all groups). HurricaneEmo serves not only as a challenging benchmark for models but also as a valuable resource for analyzing emotions in disaster-centric domains."
151,acl,2020,Label Noise in Context,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-demos.21,"Often, the data used to train ranking models is subject to label noise. For example, in web-search, labels created from clickstream data are noisy due to issues such as insufficient information in item descriptions on the SERP, query reformulation by the user, and erratic or unexpected user behavior. In practice, it is difficult to handle label noise without making strong assumptions about the label generation process. As a result, practitioners typically train their learning-to-rank (LtR) models directly on this noisy data without additional consideration of the label noise. Surprisingly, we often see strong performance from LtR models trained in this way. In this work, we describe a class of noise-tolerant LtR losses for which empirical risk minimization is a consistent procedure, even in the context of class-conditional label noise. We also develop noise-tolerant analogs of commonly used loss functions. The practical implications of our theoretical findings are further supported by experimental results."

We implement this observation by developing SynQG, a set of transparent syntactic rules leveraging universal dependencies, shallow semantic parsing, lexical resources, and custom rules which transform declarative sentences into question-answer pairs. We utilize PropBank argument descriptions and VerbNet state predicates to incorporate shallow semantic content, which helps generate questions of a descriptive nature and produce inferential and semantically richer questions than existing systems. In order to improve syntactic fluency and eliminate grammatically incorrect questions, we employ back-translation over the output of these syntactic rules. A set of crowd-sourced evaluations shows that our system can generate a larger number of highly grammatical and relevant questions than previous QG systems and that back-translation drastically improves grammaticality at a slight cost of generating irrelevant questions."
153,acl,2020,Coupling Distant Annotation and Adversarial Training for Cross-Domain Chinese Word Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.595,"Fully supervised neural approaches have achieved significant progress in the task of Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Nevertheless, the performance of supervised models tends to drop dramatically when they are applied to out-of-domain data. Performance degradation is caused by the distribution gap across domains and the out of vocabulary (OOV) problem. In order to simultaneously alleviate these two issues, this paper proposes to couple distant annotation and adversarial training for cross-domain CWS. For distant annotation, we rethink the essence of ""Chinese words"" and design an automatic distant annotation mechanism that does not need any supervision or pre-defined dictionaries from the target domain. The approach could effectively explore domain-specific words and distantly annotate the raw texts for the target domain. For adversarial training, we develop a sentence-level training procedure to perform noise reduction and maximum utilization of the source domain information. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets across various domains show the superiority and robustness of our model, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art cross-domain CWS methods."

As the core part of PLM, multi-head self-attention is appealing for its ability to jointly attend to information from different positions. However, researchers have found that PLM always exhibits fixed attention patterns regardless of the input (e.g., excessively paying attention to [CLS] or [SEP]), which we argue might neglect important information in the other positions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective attention guiding mechanism to improve the performance of PLM by encouraging attention towards the established goals. Specifically, we propose two kinds of attention guiding methods, i.e., map discrimination guiding (MDG) and attention pattern decorrelation guiding (PDG). The former definitely encourages the diversity among multiple self-attention heads to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces, while the latter encourages self-attention to attend to as many different positions of the input as possible. We conduct experiments with multiple general pre-trained models (i.e., BERT, ALBERT, and Roberta) and domain-specific pre-trained models (i.e., BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, BlueBert, and SciBERT) on three benchmark datasets (i.e., MultiNLI, MedNLI, and Cross-genre-IR). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MDG and PDG bring stable performance improvements on all datasets with high efficiency and low cost."

However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode her preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difficult to fully capture the users' preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. Namely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Specifically, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for a user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only review-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The final rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that CARL achieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the relevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction."

Retrievers based on hybrid models have been shown to outperform both BM25 and neural models alone. Our approach exploits this improved performance when training a reranker, leading to a robust reranking model. The reranker, a cross-attention neural model, is shown to be robust to different first-stage retrieval systems, achieving better performance than rerankers simply trained upon the first-stage retrievers in the multi-stage systems. We present evaluations on a supervised passage retrieval task using MS MARCO and zero-shot retrieval tasks using BEIR. The empirical results show strong performance on both evaluations."

The blanks control which part of the sequence to expand, making BLM ideal for a variety of text editing and rewriting tasks. The model can start from a single blank or partially completed text with blanks at specified locations. It iteratively determines which word to place in a blank and whether to insert new blanks, and stops generating when no blanks are left to fill. BLM can be efficiently trained using a lower bound of the marginal data likelihood. On the task of filling missing text snippets, BLM significantly outperforms all other baselines in terms of both accuracy and fluency. Experiments on style transfer and damaged ancient text restoration demonstrate the potential of this framework for a wide range of applications."

This is problematic when the information needed to recognize an event argument is spread across multiple sentences. We argue that document-level event extraction is a difficult task since it requires a view of a larger context to determine which spans of text correspond to event role fillers. We first investigate how end-to-end neural sequence models (with pre-trained language model representations) perform on document-level role filler extraction, as well as how the length of context captured affects the models' performance. To dynamically aggregate information captured by neural representations learned at different levels of granularity (e.g., the sentence- and paragraph-level), we propose a novel multi-granularity reader. We evaluate our models on the MUC-4 event extraction dataset, and show that our best system performs substantially better than prior work. We also report findings on the relationship between context length and neural model performance on the task."

Given this success, it remains an open question whether scalable learners like BERT can become fully proficient in the syntax of natural language by virtue of data scale alone, or whether they still benefit from more explicit syntactic biases. To answer this question, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy for injecting syntactic biases into BERT pretraining, by distilling the syntactically informative predictions of a hierarchical---albeit harder to scale---syntactic language model. Since BERT models masked words in bidirectional context, we propose to distill the approximate marginal distribution over words in context from the syntactic LM. Our approach reduces relative error by 2-21% on a diverse set of structured prediction tasks, although we obtain mixed results on the GLUE benchmark. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of syntactic biases, even in representation learners that exploit large amounts of data, and contribute to a better understanding of where syntactic biases are most helpful in benchmarks of natural language understanding."

As an important branch of natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis provides an effective research method for analyzing the sentiment types of massive car review texts. However, due to the lexical professionalism and large text noise of review texts in the automotive field, when a general sentiment analysis model is applied to car reviews, the accuracy of the model will be poor. To overcome these above challenges, we aim at the sentiment analysis task of car review texts. From the perspective of word vectors, pre-training is carried out by means of whole word mask of proprietary vocabulary in the automotive field, and then training data is carried out through the strategy of an adversarial training set. Based on this, we propose a car review text sentiment analysis model based on adversarial training and whole word mask BERT(ATWWM-BERT)."

Our framework introduces a principled structure for the answer choices and ties them to textual span annotations. The framework is implemented in OneStopQA, a new high-quality dataset for evaluation and analysis of reading comprehension in English. We use this dataset to demonstrate that STARC can be leveraged for a key new application for the development of SAT-like reading comprehension materials: automatic annotation quality probing via span ablation experiments. We further show that it enables in-depth analyses and comparisons between machine and human reading comprehension behavior, including error distributions and guessing ability. Our experiments also reveal that the standard multiple choice dataset in NLP, RACE, is limited in its ability to measure reading comprehension. 47% of its questions can be guessed by machines without accessing the passage, and 18% are unanimously judged by humans as not having a unique correct answer. OneStopQA provides an alternative test set for reading comprehension which alleviates these shortcomings and has a substantially higher human ceiling performance."

Motivated by the ability of a monolingual speaker learning to translate via looking up the bilingual dictionary, we propose the task to see how much potential an MT system can attain using the bilingual dictionary and large scale monolingual corpora, while is independent on parallel sentences. We propose anchored training (AT) to tackle the task. AT uses the bilingual dictionary to establish anchoring points for closing the gap between source language and target language. Experiments on various language pairs show that our approaches are significantly better than various baselines, including dictionary-based word-by-word translation, dictionary-supervised cross-lingual word embedding transformation, and unsupervised MT. On distant language pairs that are hard for unsupervised MT to perform well, AT performs remarkably better, achieving performances comparable to supervised SMT trained on more than 4M parallel sentences."

However, they are often unable to extrapolate patterns beyond the seen data, even when the abstractions required for such patterns are simple. In this paper, we first review the notion of extrapolation, why it is important and how one could hope to tackle it. We then focus on a specific type of extrapolation which is especially useful for natural language processing: generalization to sequences that are longer than the training ones. We hypothesize that models with a separate content- and location-based attention are more likely to extrapolate than those with common attention mechanisms. We empirically support our claim for recurrent seq2seq models with our proposed attention on variants of the Lookup Table task. This sheds light on some striking failures of neural models for sequences and on possible methods to approaching such issues."

Second, we present a detailed definition of comprehension -- a ""Template of Understanding"" -- for a widely useful class of texts, namely short narratives. We then conduct an experiment that strongly suggests existing systems are not up to the task of narrative understanding as we define it."

Existing automatic metrics do not capture such mistakes effectively. We tackle the problem of evaluating faithfulness of a generated summary given its source document. We first collected human annotations of faithfulness for outputs from numerous models on two datasets. We find that current models exhibit a trade-off between abstractiveness and faithfulness: outputs with less word overlap with the source document are more likely to be unfaithful. Next, we propose an automatic question answering (QA) based metric for faithfulness, FEQA, which leverages recent advances in reading comprehension. Given question-answer pairs generated from the summary, a QA model extracts answers from the document; non-matched answers indicate unfaithful information in the summary. Among metrics based on word overlap, embedding similarity, and learned language understanding models, our QA-based metric has significantly higher correlation with human faithfulness scores, especially on highly abstractive summaries."

They enable multi-protein complexes to assemble and to remain stable, and they allow signal transduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interacting partners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise maximum-entropy based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of amino-acid residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of multi-protein complexes, starting from the correlations in the sequence data of known interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods have been developed to identify which proteins are functional interaction partners among the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from sequence data alone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly higher performance for partner identification can be reached by an approximate maximization of the mutual information between the sequence alignments of the two protein families. Our mutual information-based method also provides signatures of the existence of interactions between protein families. These results stand in contrast with structure prediction of proteins and of multi-protein complexes from sequence data, where pairwise maximum-entropy based global statistical models substantially improve performance compared to mutual information. Our findings entail that the statistical dependences allowing interaction partner prediction from sequence data are not restricted to the residue pairs that are in direct contact at the interface between the partner proteins."

However, such knowledge is not sufficient to understand the implicit reasoning link between individual argumentative components (i.e., claim and premise). In this work, we focus on identifying the implicit knowledge in the form of argumentation knowledge which can help in understanding the reasoning link in arguments. Being inspired by the Argument from Consequences scheme, we propose a semi-structured template to represent such argumentation knowledge that explicates the implicit reasoning in arguments via causality. We create a novel two-phase annotation process with simplified guidelines and show how to collect and filter high-quality implicit reasonings via crowdsourcing. We find substantial inter-annotator agreement for quality evaluation between experts, but find evidence that casts a few questions on the feasibility of collecting high-quality semi-structured implicit reasoning through our crowdsourcing process. We release our materials(i.e., crowdsourcing guidelines and collected implicit reasonings) to facilitate further research towards the structured representation of argumentation knowledge."

In a pairwise ranking experiment, human raters assessing adequacy and fluency show a stronger preference for human over machine translation when evaluating documents as compared to isolated sentences. Our findings emphasise the need to shift towards document-level evaluation as machine translation improves to the degree that errors which are hard or impossible to spot at the sentence-level become decisive in discriminating quality of different translation outputs."

Given a natural language utterance, most semantic parsing systems pose the problem as one-shot translation where the utterance is mapped to a corresponding logical form. In this paper, we investigate a more interactive scenario where humans can further interact with the system by providing free-form natural language feedback to correct the system when it generates an inaccurate interpretation of an initial utterance. We focus on natural language to SQL systems and construct, SPLASH, a dataset of utterances, incorrect SQL interpretations and the corresponding natural language feedback. We compare various reference models for the correction task and show that incorporating such a rich form of feedback can significantly improve the overall semantic parsing accuracy while retaining the flexibility of natural language interaction. While we estimated human correction accuracy is 81.5%, our best model achieves only 25.1%, which leaves a large gap for improvement in future research.

However, the large number of latent variables means that inference is computationally expensive, and training a model is therefore slow to converge. In this paper, I introduce the Pixie Autoencoder, which augments the generative model of Functional Distributional Semantics with a graph-convolutional neural network to perform amortised variational inference. This allows the model to be trained more effectively, achieving better results on two tasks (semantic similarity in context and semantic composition), and outperforming BERT, a large pre-trained language model."

Recent years, as the availability of abundant large-sized and complex observational data, the constrain-based approaches have gradually attracted a lot of interest and have been widely applied to many diverse real-world problems due to the fast running speed and easy generalizing to the problem of causal insufficiency. In this paper, we aim to review the constraint-based causal discovery algorithms. Firstly, we discuss the learning paradigm of the constraint-based approaches. Secondly and primarily, the state-of-the-art constraint-based casual inference algorithms are surveyed with the detailed analysis. Thirdly, several related open-source software packages and benchmark data repositories are briefly summarized. As a conclusion, some open problems in constraint-based causal discovery are outlined for future research."

The buyer's goal is to hire a team and pay as little as possible. Recently, Karlin, Kempe and Tamir introduced a new definition of {\em frugality ratio} for this setting. Informally, the frugality ratio is the ratio of the total payment of a mechanism to perceived fair cost. In this paper, we study this together with alternative notions of fair cost, and how the resulting frugality ratios relate to each other for various kinds of set systems.   We propose a new truthful polynomial-time auction for the vertex cover problem (where the feasible sets correspond to the vertex covers of a given graph), based on the {\em local ratio} algorithm of Bar-Yehuda and Even. The mechanism guarantees to find a winning set whose cost is at most twice the optimal. In this situation, even though it is NP-hard to find a lowest-cost feasible set, we show that {\em local optimality} of a solution can be used to derive frugality bounds that are within a constant factor of best possible. To prove this result, we use our alternative notions of frugality via a bootstrapping technique, which may be of independent interest."
179,acl,2020,Is Your Classifier Actually Biased? Measuring Fairness under Uncertainty with Bernstein Bounds,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.262,"Most NLP datasets are not annotated with protected attributes such as gender, making it difficult to measure classification bias using standard measures of fairness (e.g., equal opportunity). However, manually annotating a large dataset with a protected attribute is slow and expensive. Instead of annotating all the examples, can we annotate a subset of them and use that sample to estimate the bias? While it is possible to do so, the smaller this annotated sample is, the less certain we are that the estimate is close to the true bias. In this work, we propose using Bernstein bounds to represent this uncertainty about the bias estimate as a confidence interval. We provide empirical evidence that a 95% confidence interval derived this way consistently bounds the true bias. In quantifying this uncertainty, our method, which we call Bernstein-bounded unfairness, helps prevent classifiers from being deemed biased or unbiased when there is insufficient evidence to make either claim. Our findings suggest that the datasets currently used to measure specific biases are too small to conclusively identify bias except in the most egregious cases. For example, consider a co-reference resolution system that is 5% more accurate on gender-stereotypical sentences -- to claim it is biased with 95% confidence, we need a bias-specific dataset that is 3.8 times larger than WinoBias, the largest available."

A common approach to QA has been to fine-tune a pretrained language model on a task-specific labeled dataset. This paradigm, however, relies on scarce, and costly to obtain, large-scale human-labeled data. We propose an unsupervised approach to training QA models with generated pseudo-training data. We show that generating questions for QA training by applying a simple template on a related, retrieved sentence rather than the original context sentence improves downstream QA performance by allowing the model to learn more complex context-question relationships. Training a QA model on this data gives a relative improvement over a previous unsupervised model in F1 score on the SQuAD dataset by about 14%, and 20% when the answer is a named entity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQuAD for unsupervised QA."

Previous methods sequentially encode features with a specified order. They first encode the emotion and cause features for clause extraction and then combine them for pair extraction. This lead to an imbalance in inter-task feature interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with the former. To address this issue, we propose a novel Pair-Based Joint Encoding (PBJE) network, which generates pairs and clauses features simultaneously in a joint feature encoding manner to model the causal relationship in clauses. PBJE can balance the information flow among emotion clauses, cause clauses and pairs. From a multi-relational perspective, we construct a heterogeneous undirected graph and apply the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to capture the various relationship between clauses and the relationship between pairs and clauses. Experimental results show that PBJE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Chinese benchmark corpus."

For example, when short reviews are sentiment-labeled, can these transfer to predict the sentiment of long reviews (i.e., short to long transfer), or vice versa? While unsupervised transfer learning has been well-studied for cross domain/lingual transfer tasks, Cross Length Transfer (CLT) has not yet been explored. One reason is the assumption that length difference is trivially transferable in classification. We show that it is not, because short/long texts differ in context richness and word intensity. We devise new benchmark datasets from diverse domains and languages, and show that existing models from similar tasks cannot deal with the unique challenge of transferring across text lengths. We introduce a strong baseline model called BaggedCNN that treats long texts as bags containing short texts. We propose a state-of-the-art CLT model called Length Transfer Networks (LeTraNets) that introduces a two-way encoding scheme for short and long texts using multiple training mechanisms. We test our models and find that existing models perform worse than the BaggedCNN baseline, while LeTraNets outperforms all models."

Cross-lingual SRL is one promising way to address the problem, which has achieved great advances with the help of model transferring and annotation projection. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative based on corpus translation, constructing high-quality training datasets for the target languages from the source gold-standard SRL annotations.

Based on this observation, we implement an enriched in-order shift-reduce linearization inspired by Vinyals et al.

This combination, along with a specific way of structuring sentences makes it challenging for state-of-art NLP tools to understand and reason on top of mathematical discourse. In this work, we propose a new NLP task, the natural premise selection, which is used to retrieve supporting definitions and supporting propositions that are useful for generating an informal mathematical proof for a particular statement. We also make available a dataset, NL-PS, which can be used to evaluate different approaches for the natural premise selection task. Using different baselines, we demonstrate the underlying interpretation challenges associated with the task."

However, attentive neural networks with contextual embeddings, which have achieved huge success in text classification, are rarely explored for this task. In this project, we have two major contributions. First, we create the first dialogue-based personality dataset, FriendsPersona, by annotating 5 personality traits of speakers from Friends TV Show through crowdsourcing. Second, we present a novel approach to automatic personality recognition using pre-trained contextual embeddings (BERT and RoBERTa) and attentive neural networks. Our models largely improve the state-of-art results on the monologue Essays dataset by 2.49%, and establish a solid benchmark on our FriendsPersona. By comparing results in two datasets, we demonstrate the challenges of modeling personality in multi-party dialogue."

Accompanying these staged leaps is the evaluation research and development of MT, especially the important role of evaluation methods in statistical translation and neural translation research. The evaluation task of MT is not only to evaluate the quality of machine translation, but also to give timely feedback to machine translation researchers on the problems existing in machine translation itself, how to improve and how to optimise. In some practical application fields, such as in the absence of reference translations, the quality estimation of machine translation plays an important role as an indicator to reveal the credibility of automatically translated target languages. This report mainly includes the following contents: a brief history of machine translation evaluation (MTE), the classification of research methods on MTE, and the the cutting-edge progress, including human evaluation, automatic evaluation, and evaluation of evaluation methods (meta-evaluation). Manual evaluation and automatic evaluation include reference-translation based and reference-translation independent participation; automatic evaluation methods include traditional n-gram string matching, models applying syntax and semantics, and deep learning models; evaluation of evaluation methods includes estimating the credibility of human evaluations, the reliability of the automatic evaluation, the reliability of the test set, etc. Advances in cutting-edge evaluation methods include task-based evaluation, using pre-trained language models based on big data, and lightweight optimisation models using distillation techniques."

In this paper, we show that, even though some details of the picture have changed after the switch to neural networks and continuous representations, the basic trade-off between rich features and global optimization remains essentially the same. Moreover, we show that deep contextualized word embeddings, which allow parsers to pack information about global sentence structure into local feature representations, benefit transition-based parsers more than graph-based parsers, making the two approaches virtually equivalent in terms of both accuracy and error profile. We argue that the reason is that these representations help prevent search errors and thereby allow transition-based parsers to better exploit their inherent strength of making accurate local decisions. We support this explanation by an error analysis of parsing experiments on 13 languages."

We focus on unsupervised and weakly-supervised settings where no action labels are known during training. Despite its simplicity, our model performs competitively with previous work on a dataset of naturalistic instructional videos.

We develop an annotation scheme for marking information on experiments related to solid oxide fuel cells in scientific publications, such as involved materials and measurement conditions. With this paper, we publish our annotation guidelines, as well as our SOFC-Exp corpus consisting of 45 open-access scholarly articles annotated by domain experts. A corpus and an inter-annotator agreement study demonstrate the complexity of the suggested named entity recognition and slot filling tasks as well as high annotation quality. We also present strong neural-network based models for a variety of tasks that can be addressed on the basis of our new data set.

State-of-the-art performance can be achieved by a neural sequence-to-sequence model, treating the tree construction as an incremental sequence generation problem. Structural information such as input syntax and the intermediate skeleton of the partial output has been ignored in the model, which could be potentially useful for the DRTS parsing. In this work, we propose a structural-aware model at both the encoder and decoder phase to integrate the structural information, where graph attention network (GAT) is exploited for effectively modeling. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that our proposed model is effective and can obtain the best performance in the literature."

In recent years, deep-learning-based approaches have substantially improved the performance of SAS models, but how to guarantee high-quality predictions still remains a critical issue when applying such models to the education field. Towards guaranteeing high-quality predictions, we present the first study of exploring the use of human-in-the-loop framework for minimizing the grading cost while guaranteeing the grading quality by allowing a SAS model to share the grading task with a human grader. Specifically, by introducing a confidence estimation method for indicating the reliability of the model predictions, one can guarantee the scoring quality by utilizing only predictions with high reliability for the scoring results and casting predictions with low reliability to human graders. In our experiments, we investigate the feasibility of the proposed framework using multiple confidence estimation methods and multiple SAS datasets. We find that our human-in-the-loop framework allows automatic scoring models and human graders to achieve the target scoring quality."

Comparing efficiency-based theories using dependency treebanks,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.181,"Modern medical diagnosis relies on precise pain assessment tools in translating clinical information from patient to physician. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) is a clinical pain assessment technique that utilizes 78 adjectives of different intensities in 20 different categories to quantity a patient's pain. The questionnaire's efficacy depends on a predictable pattern of adjective use by patients experiencing pain. In this study, I recreate the MPQ's adjective intensity orderings using data gathered from patient forums and modern NLP techniques. I extract adjective intensity relationships by searching for key linguistic contexts, and then combine the relationship information to form robust adjective scales. Of 17 adjective relationships predicted by this research, only 4 diverge from the MPQ's orderings, which is statistically significant at the 0.1 alpha level. The results suggest predictable patterns of adjective use by people experiencing pain, but call into question the MPQ's categories for grouping adjectives."

The corpus contains 260 human-to-human task-oriented dialogs in which an agent, given a recipe document, guides the user to cook a dish. Dialogs in CookDial exhibit two unique features: (i) procedural alignment between the dialog flow and supporting document; (ii) complex agent decision-making that involves segmenting long sentences, paraphrasing hard instructions and resolving coreference in the dialog context. In addition, we identify three challenging (sub)tasks in the assumed task-oriented dialog system: (1) User Question Understanding, (2) Agent Action Frame Prediction, and (3) Agent Response Generation. For each of these tasks, we develop a neural baseline model, which we evaluate on the CookDial dataset. We publicly release the CookDial dataset, comprising rich annotations of both dialogs and recipe documents, to stimulate further research on domain-specific document-grounded dialog systems."

In addition, these works represent sign language as a sequence of skeleton pose vectors, projected to an abstract representation with no inherent skeletal structure. In this paper, we represent sign language sequences as a skeletal graph structure, with joints as nodes and both spatial and temporal connections as edges. To operate on this graphical structure, we propose Skeletal Graph Self-Attention (SGSA), a novel graphical attention layer that embeds a skeleton inductive bias into the SLP model. Retaining the skeletal feature representation throughout, we directly apply a spatio-temporal adjacency matrix into the self-attention formulation. This provides structure and context to each skeletal joint that is not possible when using a non-graphical abstract representation, enabling fluid and expressive sign language production. We evaluate our Skeletal Graph Self-Attention architecture on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T(PHOENIX14T) dataset, achieving state-of-the-art back translation performance with an 8% and 7% improvement over competing methods for the dev and test sets."

Existing approaches are limited in their decision making due to struggles in extracting question-related rules and reasoning about them. In this paper, we present a new framework of conversational machine reading that comprises a novel Explicit Memory Tracker (EMT) to track whether conditions listed in the rule text have already been satisfied to make a decision. Moreover, our framework generates clarification questions by adopting a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, utilizing sentence-level entailment scores to weight token-level distributions. On the ShARC benchmark (blind, held-out) testset, EMT achieves new state-of-the-art results of 74.6% micro-averaged decision accuracy and 49.5 BLEU4. We also show that EMT is more interpretable by visualizing the entailment-oriented reasoning process as the conversation flows.

We propose SUPERT, which rates the quality of a summary by measuring its semantic similarity with a pseudo reference summary, i.e. selected salient sentences from the source documents, using contextualized embeddings and soft token alignment techniques. Compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised evaluation metrics, SUPERT correlates better with human ratings by 18-39%. Furthermore, we use SUPERT as rewards to guide a neural-based reinforcement learning summarizer, yielding favorable performance compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised summarizers.

However, the lack of high-quality dialog data and the expensive data annotation process greatly limit their application in real-world settings. We propose a paraphrase augmented response generation (PARG) framework that jointly trains a paraphrase model and a response generation model to improve the dialog generation performance. We also design a method to automatically construct paraphrase training data set based on dialog state and dialog act labels. PARG is applicable to various dialog generation models, such as TSCP (Lei et al., 2018) and DAMD (Zhang et al., 2019). Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves these state-of-the-art dialog models further on CamRest676 and MultiWOZ. PARG also significantly outperforms other data augmentation methods in dialog generation tasks, especially under low resource settings."

They ignore information that may be conveyed by the emotion labels themselves. We propose that the semantics of emotion labels can guide a model's attention when representing the input story. Further, we observe that the emotions evoked by an event are often related: an event that evokes joy is unlikely to also evoke sadness. In this work, we explicitly model label classes via label embeddings, and add mechanisms that track label-label correlations both during training and inference. We also introduce a new semi-supervision strategy that regularizes for the correlations on unlabeled data. Our empirical evaluations show that modeling label semantics yields consistent benefits, and we advance the state-of-the-art on an emotion inference task."
203,acl,2020,To Boldly Query What No One Has Annotated Before? The Frontiers of Corpus Querying,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.562,"Query expansion is a functionality of search engines that suggests a set of related queries for a user-issued keyword query. Typical corpus-driven keyword query expansion approaches return popular words in the results as expanded queries. Using these approaches, the expanded queries may correspond to a subset of possible query semantics, and thus miss relevant results. To handle ambiguous queries and exploratory queries, whose result relevance is difficult to judge, we propose a new framework for keyword query expansion: we start with clustering the results according to user specified granularity, and then generate expanded queries, such that one expanded query is generated for each cluster whose result set should ideally be the corresponding cluster. We formalize this problem and show its APX-hardness. Then we propose two efficient algorithms named iterative single-keyword refinement and partial elimination based convergence, respectively, which effectively generate a set of expanded queries from clustered results that provide a classification of the original query results. We believe our study of generating an optimal query based on the ground truth of the query results not only has applications in query expansion, but has significance for studying keyword search quality in general."

While much attention has been dedicated towards improvements in accuracy, there have been no attempts in the literature to our knowledge to evaluate social biases in NRE systems. We create WikiGenderBias, a distantly supervised dataset with a human annotated test set. WikiGenderBias has sentences specifically curated to analyze gender bias in relation extraction systems. We use WikiGenderBias to evaluate systems for bias and find that NRE systems exhibit gender biased predictions and lay groundwork for future evaluation of bias in NRE. We also analyze how name anonymization, hard debiasing for word embeddings, and counterfactual data augmentation affect gender bias in predictions and performance."

However, it remains unknown whether the optimization for different languages conditions the capacity of the models to generalize over syntactic structures, and how languages with syntactic phenomena of different complexity are affected. In this work, we explore the syntactic generalization capabilities of the monolingual and multilingual versions of BERT and RoBERTa. More specifically, we evaluate the syntactic generalization potential of the models on English and Spanish tests, comparing the syntactic abilities of monolingual and multilingual models on the same language (English), and of multilingual models on two different languages (English and Spanish). For English, we use the available SyntaxGym test suite; for Spanish, we introduce SyntaxGymES, a novel ensemble of targeted syntactic tests in Spanish, designed to evaluate the syntactic generalization capabilities of language models through the SyntaxGym online platform."

To improve the performance of these discrete speech tokens, we present RepCodec, a novel speech representation codec for semantic speech tokenization. In contrast to audio codecs which reconstruct the raw audio, RepCodec learns a vector quantization codebook through reconstructing speech representations from speech encoders like HuBERT or data2vec. Together, the speech encoder, the codec encoder and the vector quantization codebook form a pipeline for converting speech waveforms into semantic tokens. The extensive experiments illustrate that RepCodec, by virtue of its enhanced information retention capacity, significantly outperforms the widely used k-means clustering approach in both speech understanding and generation. Furthermore, this superiority extends across various speech encoders and languages, affirming the robustness of RepCodec. We believe our method can facilitate large language modeling research on speech processing."

The model utilizes dynamic routing to provide more flexibility to memory-based few-shot learning in order to better adapt the support sets, which is a critical capacity of few-shot classification models. Based on that, we further develop induction models with query information, aiming to enhance the generalization ability of meta-learning.

Self-attention is currently widely used, however interpretability is difficult due to the numerous attention distributions. Recent work has shown that model representations can benefit from label-specific information, while facilitating interpretation of predictions. We introduce the Label Attention Layer: a new form of self-attention where attention heads represent labels. We test our novel layer by running constituency and dependency parsing experiments and show our new model obtains new state-of-the-art results for both tasks on both the Penn Treebank (PTB) and Chinese Treebank. Additionally, our model requires fewer self-attention layers compared to existing work. Finally, we find that the Label Attention heads learn relations between syntactic categories and show pathways to analyze errors."

Our model induces a joint function-specific word vector space, where vectors of e.g. plausible SVO compositions lie close together. The model retains information about word group membership even in the joint space, and can thereby effectively be applied to a number of tasks reasoning over the SVO structure. We show the robustness and versatility of the proposed framework by reporting state-of-the-art results on the tasks of estimating selectional preference and event similarity. The results indicate that the combinations of representations learned with our task-independent model outperform task-specific architectures from prior work, while reducing the number of parameters by up to 95%."

However, high-level reasoning skills, such as numerical reasoning, are difficult to learn from a language-modeling objective only. Consequently, existing models for numerical reasoning have used specialized architectures with limited flexibility. In this work, we show that numerical reasoning is amenable to automatic data generation, and thus one can inject this skill into pre-trained LMs, by generating large amounts of data, and training in a multi-task setup. We show that pre-training our model, GenBERT, on this data, dramatically improves performance on DROP (49.3 $\rightarrow$ 72.3 F1), reaching performance that matches state-of-the-art models of comparable size, while using a simple and general-purpose encoder-decoder architecture. Moreover, GenBERT generalizes well to math word problem datasets, while maintaining high performance on standard RC tasks. Our approach provides a general recipe for injecting skills into large pre-trained LMs, whenever the skill is amenable to automatic data augmentation."

However, there is a lack of datasets that realistically address such use cases at a scale large enough for training supervised models for this task. This work presents a new dataset for MDS that is large both in the total number of document clusters and in the size of individual clusters. We build this dataset by leveraging the Wikipedia Current Events Portal (WCEP), which provides concise and neutral human-written summaries of news events, with links to external source articles. We also automatically extend these source articles by looking for related articles in the Common Crawl archive. We provide a quantitative analysis of the dataset and empirical results for several state-of-the-art MDS techniques."

Unlike traditional document summarization, timeline summarization needs to model the time series information of the input events and summarize important events in chronological order. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Unified Timeline Summarizer (UTS) that can generate abstractive and extractive timeline summaries in time order. Concretely, in the encoder part, we propose a graph-based event encoder that relates multiple events according to their content dependency and learns a global representation of each event. In the decoder part, to ensure the chronological order of the abstractive summary, we propose to extract the feature of event-level attention in its generation process with sequential information remained and use it to simulate the evolutionary attention of the ground truth summary. The event-level attention can also be used to assist in extracting summary, where the extracted summary also comes in time sequence. We augment the previous Chinese large-scale timeline summarization dataset and collect a new English timeline dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on these datasets and on the out-of-domain Timeline 17 dataset show that UTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both automatic and human evaluations."

Our experiments on two publicly available clinical data sets (107,372 reports of MIMIC-CXR, and 3,366 reports of OpenI) show that our model statistically significantly boosts state-of-the-art results in terms of Rouge metrics (with improvements: 2.9% RG-1, 2.5% RG-2, 1.9% RG-L), in the healthcare domain where any range of improvement impacts patients' welfare."

The two most prominent approaches to this problem are structural correspondence learning and autoencoders. However, they either require long training times or suffer greatly on highly divergent domains. Inspired by recent advances in cross-lingual sentiment analysis, we provide a novel perspective and cast the domain adaptation problem as an embedding projection task. Our model takes as input two mono-domain embedding spaces and learns to project them to a bi-domain space, which is jointly optimized to (1) project across domains and to (2) predict sentiment. We perform domain adaptation experiments on 20 source-target domain pairs for sentiment classification and report novel state-of-the-art results on 11 domain pairs, including the Amazon domain adaptation datasets and SemEval 2013 and 2016 datasets. Our analysis shows that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches on domains that are similar, while performing significantly better on highly divergent domains.

We explore the more realistic few-shot setting, where only a few hundred training examples are available, and observe that standard models perform poorly, highlighting the discrepancy between current pretraining objectives and question answering. We propose a new pretraining scheme tailored for question answering: recurring span selection. Given a passage with multiple sets of recurring spans, we mask in each set all recurring spans but one, and ask the model to select the correct span in the passage for each masked span. Masked spans are replaced with a special token, viewed as a question representation, that is later used during fine-tuning to select the answer span. The resulting model obtains surprisingly good results on multiple benchmarks (e.g., 72.7 F1 on SQuAD with only 128 training examples), while maintaining competitive performance in the high-resource setting."

The problem exacerbates with cross-lingual EL which involves linking mentions written in non-English documents to entries in the English Wikipedia: to compare textual clues across languages we need to compute similarity between textual fragments across languages. In this paper, we propose a neural EL model that trains fine-grained similarities and dissimilarities between the query and candidate document from multiple perspectives, combined with convolution and tensor networks. Further, we show that this English-trained system can be applied, in zero-shot learning, to other languages by making surprisingly effective use of multi-lingual embeddings.

Moreover, switching between independent applications for literature discovery, bibliography management, reading papers, and writing text burdens authors further and interrupts their creative process. Here, we present a web application that combines text editing and literature discovery in an interactive user interface. The application is equipped with a search engine that couples Boolean keyword filtering with nearest neighbor search over text embeddings, providing a discovery experience tuned to an author's manuscript and his interests. Our application aims to take a step towards more enjoyable and effortless academic writing.   The demo of the application (https://SciEditorDemo2020.herokuapp.com/) and a short video tutorial (https://youtu.be/pkdVU60IcRc) are available online."
220,acl,2020,"Simple, Interpretable and Stable Method for Detecting Words with Usage Change across Corpora",https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.51,"The problem of comparing two bodies of text and searching for words that differ in their usage between them arises often in digital humanities and computational social science. This is commonly approached by training word embeddings on each corpus, aligning the vector spaces, and looking for words whose cosine distance in the aligned space is large. However, these methods often require extensive filtering of the vocabulary to perform well, and - as we show in this work - result in unstable, and hence less reliable, results. We propose an alternative approach that does not use vector space alignment, and instead considers the neighbors of each word. The method is simple, interpretable and stable. We demonstrate its effectiveness in 9 different setups, considering different corpus splitting criteria (age, gender and profession of tweet authors, time of tweet) and different languages (English, French and Hebrew)."
221,acl,2020,Recurrent Chunking Mechanisms for Long-Text Machine Reading Comprehension,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.603,"In this paper, we study machine reading comprehension (MRC) on long texts, where a model takes as inputs a lengthy document and a question and then extracts a text span from the document as an answer. State-of-the-art models tend to use a pretrained transformer model (e.g., BERT) to encode the joint contextual information of document and question. However, these transformer-based models can only take a fixed-length (e.g., 512) text as its input. To deal with even longer text inputs, previous approaches usually chunk them into equally-spaced segments and predict answers based on each segment independently without considering the information from other segments. As a result, they may form segments that fail to cover the correct answer span or retain insufficient contexts around it, which significantly degrades the performance. Moreover, they are less capable of answering questions that need cross-segment information.   We propose to let a model learn to chunk in a more flexible way via reinforcement learning: a model can decide the next segment that it wants to process in either direction. We also employ recurrent mechanisms to enable information to flow across segments. Experiments on three MRC datasets -- CoQA, QuAC, and TriviaQA -- demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed recurrent chunking mechanisms: we can obtain segments that are more likely to contain complete answers and at the same time provide sufficient contexts around the ground truth answers for better predictions."

Researchers sift through thousands of studies to identify a few relevant ones. Automation techniques can help by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of this task. To this end, we developed CRUISE-Screening, a web-based application for conducting living literature reviews - a type of literature review that is continuously updated to reflect the latest research in a particular field. CRUISE-Screening is connected to several search engines via an API, which allows for updating the search results periodically. Moreover, it can facilitate the process of screening for relevant publications by using text classification and question answering models. CRUISE-Screening can be used both by researchers conducting literature reviews and by those working on automating the citation screening process to validate their algorithms. The application is open-source: https://github.com/ProjectDoSSIER/cruise-screening, and a demo is available under this URL: https://citation-screening.ec.tuwien.ac.at.

223,acl,2020,Probing Linguistic Systematicity,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.177,"Recently, there has been much interest in the question of whether deep natural language understanding models exhibit systematicity; generalizing such that units like words make consistent contributions to the meaning of the sentences in which they appear. There is accumulating evidence that neural models often generalize non-systematically. We examined the notion of systematicity from a linguistic perspective, defining a set of probes and a set of metrics to measure systematic behaviour. We also identified ways in which network architectures can generalize non-systematically, and discuss why such forms of generalization may be unsatisfying. As a case study, we performed a series of experiments in the setting of natural language inference (NLI), demonstrating that some NLU systems achieve high overall performance despite being non-systematic."
224,acl,2020,Learning Dialog Policies from Weak Demonstrations,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.129,"Multi-action dialog policy (MADP), which generates multiple atomic dialog actions per turn, has been widely applied in task-oriented dialog systems to provide expressive and efficient system responses. Existing MADP models usually imitate action combinations from the labeled multi-action dialog samples. Due to data limitations, they generalize poorly toward unseen dialog flows. While interactive learning and reinforcement learning algorithms can be applied to incorporate external data sources of real users and user simulators, they take significant manual effort to build and suffer from instability. To address these issues, we propose Planning Enhanced Dialog Policy (PEDP), a novel multi-task learning framework that learns single-action dialog dynamics to enhance multi-action prediction. Our PEDP method employs model-based planning for conceiving what to express before deciding the current response through simulating single-action dialogs. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ dataset demonstrate that our fully supervised learning-based method achieves a solid task success rate of 90.6%, improving 3% compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

DFNs differ from most state-of-the-art models in their use of a dynamic multi-strategy attention process, in which passages, questions and answer candidates are jointly fused into attention vectors, along with a dynamic multi-step reasoning module for generating answers. With the use of reinforcement learning, for each input sample that consists of a question, a passage and a list of candidate answers, an instance of DFN with a sample-specific network architecture can be dynamically constructed by determining what attention strategy to apply and how many reasoning steps to take. Experiments show that DFNs achieve the best result reported on RACE, a challenging MRC dataset that contains real human reading questions in a wide variety of types. A detailed empirical analysis also demonstrates that DFNs can produce attention vectors that summarize information from questions, passages and answer candidates more effectively than other popular MRC models."

Past approaches struggle to cover this space of paraphrase possibilities in an interpretable manner. Our work, inspired by pre-ordering literature in machine translation, uses syntactic transformations to softly ""reorder'' the source sentence and guide our neural paraphrasing model. First, given an input sentence, we derive a set of feasible syntactic rearrangements using an encoder-decoder model. This model operates over a partially lexical, partially syntactic view of the sentence and can reorder big chunks. Next, we use each proposed rearrangement to produce a sequence of position embeddings, which encourages our final encoder-decoder paraphrase model to attend to the source words in a particular order. Our evaluation, both automatic and human, shows that the proposed system retains the quality of the baseline approaches while giving a substantial increase in the diversity of the generated paraphrases"

We focus on clustering extracted glyph images into underlying templates in the presence of multiple confounding sources of variance. Our approach introduces a neural editor model that first generates well-understood printing phenomena like spatial perturbations from template parameters via interpertable latent variables, and then modifies the result by generating a non-interpretable latent vector responsible for inking variations, jitter, noise from the archiving process, and other unforeseen phenomena associated with Early Modern printing. Critically, by introducing an inference network whose input is restricted to the visual residual between the observation and the interpretably-modified template, we are able to control and isolate what the vector-valued latent variable captures. We show that our approach outperforms rigid interpretable clustering baselines (Ocular) and overly-flexible deep generative models (VAE) alike on the task of completely unsupervised discovery of typefaces in mixed-font documents."

We review these approaches in the context of an asymmetric-resource one-to-many translation task, in which the pair of target languages are related, with one being a very low-resource and the other a higher-resource language. We test various methods on three artificially restricted translation tasks -- English to Estonian (low-resource) and Finnish (high-resource), English to Slovak and Czech, English to Danish and Swedish -- and one real-world task, Norwegian to North S\'ami and Finnish. The experiments show positive effects especially for scheduled multi-task learning, denoising autoencoder, and subword sampling."
229,acl,2020,NeuInfer: Knowledge Inference on N-ary Facts,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.546,"N-ary facts composed of a primary triple (head entity, relation, tail entity) and an arbitrary number of auxiliary attribute-value pairs, are prevalent in real-world knowledge graphs (KGs). Link prediction on n-ary facts is to predict a missing element in an n-ary fact. This helps populate and enrich KGs and further promotes numerous downstream applications. Previous studies usually require a substantial amount of high-quality data to understand the elements in n-ary facts. However, these studies overlook few-shot relations, which have limited labeled instances, yet are common in real-world scenarios. Thus, this paper introduces a new task, few-shot link prediction on n-ary facts. It aims to predict a missing entity in an n-ary fact with limited labeled instances. We further propose a model for Few-shot Link prEdict on N-ary facts, thus called FLEN, which consists of three modules: the relation learning, support-specific adjusting, and query inference modules. FLEN captures relation meta information from limited instances to predict a missing entity in a query instance. To validate the effectiveness of FLEN, we construct three datasets based on existing benchmark data. Our experimental results show that FLEN significantly outperforms existing related models in both few-shot link prediction on n-ary facts and binary facts."

In recent years, there are a few datasets for machine reading comprehension tasks in Vietnamese with large sizes, such as UIT-ViQuAD and UIT-ViNewsQA. However, the datasets are not diverse in answers to serve the research. In this paper, we introduce UIT-ViWikiQA, the first dataset for evaluating sentence extraction-based machine reading comprehension in the Vietnamese language. The UIT-ViWikiQA dataset is converted from the UIT-ViQuAD dataset, consisting of comprises 23.074 question-answers based on 5.109 passages of 174 Wikipedia Vietnamese articles. We propose a conversion algorithm to create the dataset for sentence extraction-based machine reading comprehension and three types of approaches for sentence extraction-based machine reading comprehension in Vietnamese. Our experiments show that the best machine model is XLM-R_Large, which achieves an exact match (EM) of 85.97% and an F1-score of 88.77% on our dataset. Besides, we analyze experimental results in terms of the question type in Vietnamese and the effect of context on the performance of the MRC models, thereby showing the challenges from the UIT-ViWikiQA dataset that we propose to the language processing community."

Existing works usually ignore the context that is not explicitly provided, resulting in a context-independent semantic representation that struggles to support the generation. To address this, we propose an approach that automatically finds evidence for an event from a large text corpus, and leverages the evidence to guide the generation of inferential texts. Our approach works in an encoder-decoder manner and is equipped with a Vector Quantised-Variational Autoencoder, where the encoder outputs representations from a distribution over discrete variables. Such discrete representations enable automatically selecting relevant evidence, which not only facilitates evidence-aware generation, but also provides a natural way to uncover rationales behind the generation. Our approach provides state-of-the-art performance on both Event2Mind and ATOMIC datasets. More importantly, we find that with discrete representations, our model selectively uses evidence to generate different inferential texts."

Most methods use the gradient to attack the model on each sample independently. Instead of mechanically applying the gradient, could we learn to produce meaningful adversarial attacks ? In contrast to existing approaches, we learn to attack a model by training an adversarial generator based on a language model. We propose the Masked Adversarial Generation (MAG) model, that learns to perturb the translation model throughout the training process. The experiments show that it improves the robustness of machine translation models, while being faster than competing methods."

Often the data is in a data lake without a consistent schema, making locating useful data challenging. Table search is a growing research area, but existing benchmarks have been limited to displayed tables. Tables sized and formatted for display in a Wikipedia page or ArXiv paper are considerably different from data tables in both scale and style. By using metadata associated with open data from government portals, we create the first dataset to benchmark search over data tables at scale. We demonstrate three styles of table-to-table related table search. The three notions of table relatedness are: tables produced by the same organization, tables distributed as part of the same dataset, and tables with a high degree of overlap in the annotated tags. The keyword tags provided with the metadata also permit the automatic creation of a keyword search over tables benchmark. We provide baselines on this dataset using existing methods including traditional and neural approaches."

However, the definition of uninformative vocabulary is vague, so most algorithms use general knowledge-based stop lists to remove stop words. There is an ongoing debate among academics about the usefulness of stop word elimination, especially in domain-specific settings. In this work, we investigate the usefulness of stop word removal in a software engineering context. To do this, we replicate and experiment with three software engineering research tools from related work. Additionally, we construct a corpus of software engineering domain-related text from 10,000 Stack Overflow questions and identify 200 domain-specific stop words using traditional information-theoretic methods. Our results show that the use of domain-specific stop words significantly improved the performance of research tools compared to the use of a general stop list and that 17 out of 19 evaluation measures showed better performance.

235,acl,2020,A Multi-Perspective Architecture for Semantic Code Search,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.758,"With the increase in the number of open repositories and discussion forums, the use of natural language for semantic code search has become increasingly common. The accuracy of the results returned by such systems, however, can be low due to 1) limited shared vocabulary between code and user query and 2) inadequate semantic understanding of user query and its relation to code syntax. Siamese networks are well suited to learning such joint relations between data, but have not been explored in the context of code search. In this work, we evaluate Siamese networks for this task by exploring multiple extraction network architectures. These networks independently process code and text descriptions before passing them to a Siamese network to learn embeddings in a common space. We experiment on two different datasets and discover that Siamese networks can act as strong regularizers on networks that extract rich information from code and text, which in turn helps achieve impressive performance on code search beating previous baselines on $2$ programming languages. We also analyze the embedding space of these networks and provide directions to fully leverage the power of Siamese networks for semantic code search."

In particular, we study the different aspects of controlling generative dialogue systems, including controlling styles and topics and continuously adding and combining dialogue skills. In the three decades since the first dialogue system was commercialized, the basic architecture of such systems has remained substantially unchanged, consisting of four pipelined basic components, namely, natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue state tracking (DST), a dialogue manager (DM) and natural language generation (NLG). The dialogue manager, which is the critical component of the modularized system, controls the response content and style. This module is usually programmed by rules and is designed to be highly controllable and easily extendable. With the emergence of powerful ""deep learning"" architectures, end-to-end generative dialogue systems have been proposed to optimize overall system performance and simplify training. However, these systems cannot be easily controlled and extended as the modularized dialogue manager can. This is because a single neural system is used, which is usually a large pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-2), and thus it is hard to surgically change desirable attributes (e.g., style, topics, etc.). More importantly, uncontrollable dialogue systems can generate offensive and even toxic responses. Therefore, in this thesis, we study controllable methods for end-to-end generative dialogue systems in task-oriented and chit-chat scenarios. Throughout the chapters, we describe 1) how to control the style and topics of chit-chat models, 2) how to continuously control and extend task-oriented dialogue systems, and 3) how to compose and control multi-skill dialogue models."

Nevertheless, media outlets are often biased. One way to bias news articles is by altering the word choice. The automatic identification of bias by word choice is challenging, primarily due to the lack of gold-standard data sets and high context dependencies. In this research project, I aim to devise data sets and methods to identify media bias. To achieve this, I plan to research methods using natural language processing and deep learning while employing models and using analysis concepts from psychology and linguistics. The first results indicate the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary research approach. My vision is to devise a system that helps news readers become aware of media coverage differences caused by bias. So far, my best performing BERT-based model is pre-trained on a larger corpus consisting of distant labels, indicating that distant supervision has the potential to become a solution for the difficult task of bias detection."

We show how episodic memory and semantic memory can be realized and discuss how new memory traces can be generated from sensory input: Existing memories are the basis for perception and new memories are generated via perception. We relate our mathematical approach to the hippocampal memory indexing theory. We describe the first detailed mathematical models for the complete processing pipeline from sensory input and its semantic decoding, i.e., perception, to the formation of episodic and semantic memories and their declarative semantic decodings. Our main hypothesis is that perception includes an active semantic decoding process, which relies on latent representations of entities and predicates, and that episodic and semantic memories depend on the same decoding process. We contribute to the debate between the leading memory consolidation theories, i.e., the standard consolidation theory (SCT) and the multiple trace theory (MTT). The latter is closely related to the complementary learning systems (CLS) framework. In particular, we show explicitly how episodic memory can teach the neocortex to form a semantic memory, which is a core issue in MTT and CLS."

This has motivated the development of methods for interpreting such models, e.g., via gradient-based saliency maps or the visualization of attention weights. Such approaches aim to provide explanations for a particular model prediction by highlighting important words in the corresponding input text. While this might be useful for tasks where decisions are explicitly influenced by individual tokens in the input, we suspect that such highlighting is not suitable for tasks where model decisions should be driven by more complex reasoning. In this work, we investigate the use of influence functions for NLP, providing an alternative approach to interpreting neural text classifiers. Influence functions explain the decisions of a model by identifying influential training examples. Despite the promise of this approach, influence functions have not yet been extensively evaluated in the context of NLP, a gap addressed by this work. We conduct a comparison between influence functions and common word-saliency methods on representative tasks. As suspected, we find that influence functions are particularly useful for natural language inference, a task in which 'saliency maps' may not have clear interpretation. Furthermore, we develop a new quantitative measure based on influence functions that can reveal artifacts in training data."
240,acl,2020,Considering Likelihood in NLP Classification Explanations with Occlusion and Language Modeling,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-srw.16,"Recently, state-of-the-art NLP models gained an increasing syntactic and semantic understanding of language, and explanation methods are crucial to understand their decisions. Occlusion is a well established method that provides explanations on discrete language data, e.g. by removing a language unit from an input and measuring the impact on a model's decision. We argue that current occlusion-based methods often produce invalid or syntactically incorrect language data, neglecting the improved abilities of recent NLP models. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation methods disregard the discrete distribution of data in NLP. Thus, we propose OLM: a novel explanation method that combines occlusion and language models to sample valid and syntactically correct replacements with high likelihood, given the context of the original input. We lay out a theoretical foundation that alleviates these weaknesses of other explanation methods in NLP and provide results that underline the importance of considering data likelihood in occlusion-based explanation."

Comparatives are structurally complex in that they interact with other linguistic phenomena such as quantifiers, numerals, and lexical antonyms. In formal semantics, there is a rich body of work on comparatives and gradable expressions using the notion of degree. However, a logical inference system for comparatives has not been sufficiently developed for use in the NLI task. In this paper, we present a compositional semantics that maps various comparative constructions in English to semantic representations via Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) parsers and combine it with an inference system based on automated theorem proving. We evaluate our system on three NLI datasets that contain complex logical inferences with comparatives, generalized quantifiers, and numerals. We show that the system outperforms previous logic-based systems as well as recent deep learning-based models."

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) objective is widely adopted in existing dialogue model learning. However, models trained with MLE objective function are plagued by the low-diversity issue when it comes to the open-domain conversational setting. Inspired by the observation that humans not only learn from the positive signals but also benefit from correcting behaviors of undesirable actions, in this work, we introduce contrastive learning into dialogue generation, where the model explicitly perceives the difference between the well-chosen positive and negative utterances. Specifically, we employ a pretrained baseline model as a reference. During contrastive learning, the target dialogue model is trained to give higher conditional probabilities for the positive samples, and lower conditional probabilities for those negative samples, compared to the reference model. To manage the multi-mapping relations prevailed in human conversation, we augment contrastive dialogue learning with group-wise dual sampling. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed group-wise contrastive learning framework is suited for training a wide range of neural dialogue generation models with very favorable performance over the baseline training approaches."

We view the subword segmentation of output sentences as a latent variable that should be marginalized out for learning and inference. A mixed character-subword transformer is proposed, which enables exact log marginal likelihood estimation and exact MAP inference to find target segmentations with maximum posterior probability. DPE uses a lightweight mixed character-subword transformer as a means of pre-processing parallel data to segment output sentences using dynamic programming. Empirical results on machine translation suggest that DPE is effective for segmenting output sentences and can be combined with BPE dropout for stochastic segmentation of source sentences. DPE achieves an average improvement of 0.9 BLEU over BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) and an average improvement of 0.55 BLEU over BPE dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) on several WMT datasets including English <=> (German, Romanian, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian)."

QuASE learns representations from QA data, using BERT or other state-of-the-art contextual language models. In particular, we observe the need to distinguish between two types of sentence encodings, depending on whether the target task is a single- or multi-sentence input; in both cases, the resulting encoding is shown to be an easy-to-use plugin for many downstream tasks.

Our OOV handling method successfully improves performances of this model on every language but one to achieve a new state-of-the-art on the Universal Dependencies Dataset 1.4."

We focus on the importance of variable binding and its instantiation in attention-based models, and argue that Transformer is not a sequence model but an induced-structure model. This perspective leads to predictions of the challenges facing research in deep learning architectures for natural language understanding."

We systematically measure out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for seven NLP datasets by constructing a new robustness benchmark with realistic distribution shifts. We measure the generalization of previous models including bag-of-words models, ConvNets, and LSTMs, and we show that pretrained Transformers' performance declines are substantially smaller. Pretrained transformers are also more effective at detecting anomalous or OOD examples, while many previous models are frequently worse than chance. We examine which factors affect robustness, finding that larger models are not necessarily more robust, distillation can be harmful, and more diverse pretraining data can enhance robustness. Finally, we show where future work can improve OOD robustness."

In that context, data-synthesis methods to create high-quality synthetic data have also received much attention. Considering that APE takes machine-translation outputs containing translation errors as input, we propose a noising-based data-synthesis method that uses a mask language model to create noisy texts through substituting masked tokens with erroneous tokens, yet following the error-quantity statistics appearing in genuine APE data. In addition, we propose corpus interleaving, which is to combine two separate synthetic data by taking only advantageous samples, to further enhance the quality of the synthetic data created with our noising method. Experimental results reveal that using the synthetic data created with our approach results in significant improvements in APE performance upon using other synthetic data created with different existing data-synthesis methods."

Recently, several works have attempted to extend the models for end-to-end speech translation task. However, the usefulness of these models were only investigated on language pairs with similar syntax and word order (e.g., English-French or English-Spanish). In this work, we focus on end-to-end speech translation tasks on syntactically distant language pairs (e.g., English-Japanese) that require distant word reordering.   To guide the encoder-decoder attentional model to learn this difficult problem, we propose a structured-based curriculum learning strategy.   Unlike conventional curriculum learning that gradually emphasizes difficult data examples, we formalize learning strategies from easier network structures to more difficult network structures. Here, we start the training with end-to-end encoder-decoder for speech recognition or text-based machine translation task then gradually move to end-to-end speech translation task. The experiment results show that the proposed approach could provide significant improvements in comparison with the one without curriculum learning."
254,acl,2020,TaPas: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via Pre-training,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.398,"Answering natural language questions over tables is usually seen as a semantic parsing task. To alleviate the collection cost of full logical forms, one popular approach focuses on weak supervision consisting of denotations instead of logical forms. However, training semantic parsers from weak supervision poses difficulties, and in addition, the generated logical forms are only used as an intermediate step prior to retrieving the denotation. In this paper, we present TAPAS, an approach to question answering over tables without generating logical forms. TAPAS trains from weak supervision, and predicts the denotation by selecting table cells and optionally applying a corresponding aggregation operator to such selection. TAPAS extends BERT's architecture to encode tables as input, initializes from an effective joint pre-training of text segments and tables crawled from Wikipedia, and is trained end-to-end. We experiment with three different semantic parsing datasets, and find that TAPAS outperforms or rivals semantic parsing models by improving state-of-the-art accuracy on SQA from 55.1 to 67.2 and performing on par with the state-of-the-art on WIKISQL and WIKITQ, but with a simpler model architecture. We additionally find that transfer learning, which is trivial in our setting, from WIKISQL to WIKITQ, yields 48.7 accuracy, 4.2 points above the state-of-the-art."

However, despite these advances, there are still desirable functionalities missing from the fact-checking pipeline. In this survey, we focus on the explanation functionality -- that is fact-checking systems providing reasons for their predictions. We summarize existing methods for explaining the predictions of fact-checking systems and we explore trends in this topic. Further, we consider what makes for good explanations in this specific domain through a comparative analysis of existing fact-checking explanations against some desirable properties. Finally, we propose further research directions for generating fact-checking explanations, and describe how these may lead to improvements in the research area."

However, subject to the large amount of manual work cost in subject recruitment and data processing, conventional self-reported method cannot be implemented in real time or applied in large scale investigation. To solve the problem, this paper proposed an approach to predict users' social satisfaction, especially for the economy-related satisfaction based on users' social media records. We recruited 2,018 Cantonese active participants from each city in Guangdong province according to the population distribution. Both behavioral and linguistic features of the participants are extracted from the online records of social media, i.e., Sina Weibo. Regression models are used to predict Sina Weibo users' social satisfaction. Furthermore, we consult the economic indexes of Guangdong in 2012, and calculate the correlations between these indexes and the predicted social satisfaction. Results indicate that social satisfaction can be significantly expressed by specific social media features; local economy satisfaction has significant positive correlations with several local economy indexes, which supports that it is reliable to predict social satisfaction from social media."

In this paper, a deep generative model is introduced to capture continuous probability densities corresponding to the nodes of an arbitrary graph. In contrast to all learning formulations in the area of discriminative pattern recognition, we propose a scalable generative optimization/algorithm theoretically proved to capture distributions at the nodes of a graph. Our model is able to generate samples from the probability densities learned at each node. This probabilistic data generation model, i.e. convolutional graph auto-encoder (CGAE), is devised based on the localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions, deep learning, and the variational Bayesian inference. We apply our CGAE to a new problem, the spatio-temporal probabilistic solar irradiance prediction. Multiple solar radiation measurement sites in a wide area in northern states of the US are modeled as an undirected graph. Using our proposed model, the distribution of future irradiance given historical radiation observations is estimated for every site/node. Numerical results on the National Solar Radiation Database show state-of-the-art performance for probabilistic radiation prediction on geographically distributed irradiance data in terms of reliability, sharpness, and continuous ranked probability score."

Recent event-centric reading comprehension datasets focus mostly on event arguments or temporal relations. While these tasks partially evaluate machines' ability of narrative understanding, human-like reading comprehension requires the capability to process event-based information beyond arguments and temporal reasoning. For example, to understand causality between events, we need to infer motivation or purpose; to establish event hierarchy, we need to understand the composition of events. To facilitate these tasks, we introduce ESTER, a comprehensive machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset for Event Semantic Relation Reasoning. The dataset leverages natural language queries to reason about the five most common event semantic relations, provides more than 6K questions and captures 10.1K event relation pairs. Experimental results show that the current SOTA systems achieve 22.1%, 63.3%, and 83.5% for token-based exact-match, F1, and event-based HIT@1 scores, which are all significantly below human performances (36.0%, 79.6%, 100% respectively), highlighting our dataset as a challenging benchmark."

Since these models are typically guided by a sequence of learned self attention mechanisms and may comprise undesired inductive biases, it is paramount to be able to explore what the attention has learned. While static analyses of these models lead to targeted insights, interactive tools are more dynamic and can help humans better gain an intuition for the model-internal reasoning process. We present exBERT, an interactive tool named after the popular BERT language model, that provides insights into the meaning of the contextual representations by matching a human-specified input to similar contexts in a large annotated dataset. By aggregating the annotations of the matching similar contexts, exBERT helps intuitively explain what each attention-head has learned."

While the existing approaches tackle this problem using a lexically constrained beam search algorithm or dedicated model using non-autoregressive decoding, there is a trade-off between the generated text quality and the hard constraint satisfaction. We introduce AutoTemplate, a simple yet effective lexically constrained text generation framework divided into template generation and lexicalization tasks. The template generation is to generate the text with the placeholders, and lexicalization replaces them into the constraint lexicons to perform lexically constrained text generation. We conducted the experiments on two tasks: keywords-to-sentence generations and entity-guided summarization. Experimental results show that the AutoTemplate outperforms the competitive baselines on both tasks while satisfying the hard lexical constraints."

However, most existing researches focus on reducing model's prediction error but ignore the error caused by the uneven distribution of spatial events within a region. In this paper, we study a region partitioning problem, namely optimal grid size selection problem (OGSS), which aims to minimize the real error of spatiotemporal prediction models by selecting the optimal grid size. In order to solve OGSS, we analyze the upper bound of real error of spatiotemporal prediction models and minimize the real error by minimizing its upper bound. Through in-depth analysis, we find that the upper bound of real error will decrease then increase when the number of model grids increase from 1 to the maximum allowed value. Then, we propose two algorithms, namely Ternary Search and Iterative Method, to automatically find the optimal grid size. Finally, the experiments verify that the error of prediction has the same trend as its upper bound, and the change trend of the upper bound of real error with respect to the increase of the number of model grids will decrease then increase. Meanwhile, in a case study, by selecting the optimal grid size, the order dispatching results of a state-of-the-art prediction-based algorithm can be improved up to 13.6%, which shows the effectiveness of our methods on tuning the region partition for spatiotemporal prediction models."

FunLines makes the humor generation process fun, interactive, collaborative, rewarding and educational, keeping players engaged and providing humor data at a very low cost compared to traditional crowdsourcing approaches. FunLines offers useful performance feedback, assisting players in getting better over time at generating and assessing humor, as our analysis shows. This helps to further increase the quality of the generated dataset. We show the effectiveness of this data by training humor classification models that outperform a previous benchmark, and we release this dataset to the public."

In this paper, we cast bridging anaphora resolution as question answering based on context. This allows us to find the antecedent for a given anaphor without knowing any gold mention information (except the anaphor itself). We present a question answering framework (BARQA) for this task, which leverages the power of transfer learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to generate a large amount of ""quasi-bridging"" training data. We show that our model pre-trained on this dataset and fine-tuned on a small amount of in-domain dataset achieves new state-of-the-art results for bridging anaphora resolution on two bridging corpora (ISNotes (Markert et al., 2012) and BASHI (Roesiger, 2018))."

Few-shot slot tagging faces a unique challenge compared to the other few-shot classification problems as it calls for modeling the dependencies between labels. But it is hard to apply previously learned label dependencies to an unseen domain, due to the discrepancy of label sets. To tackle this, we introduce a collapsed dependency transfer mechanism into the conditional random field (CRF) to transfer abstract label dependency patterns as transition scores. In the few-shot setting, the emission score of CRF can be calculated as a word's similarity to the representation of each label. To calculate such similarity, we propose a Label-enhanced Task-Adaptive Projection Network (L-TapNet) based on the state-of-the-art few-shot classification model -- TapNet, by leveraging label name semantics in representing labels. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the strongest few-shot learning baseline by 14.64 F1 scores in the one-shot setting."

Existing entity embeddings are learned from canonical Wikipedia articles and local contexts surrounding target entities. Such entity embeddings are effective, but too distinctive for linking models to learn contextual commonality. We propose a simple yet effective method, FGS2EE, to inject fine-grained semantic information into entity embeddings to reduce the distinctiveness and facilitate the learning of contextual commonality. FGS2EE first uses the embeddings of semantic type words to generate semantic embeddings, and then combines them with existing entity embeddings through linear aggregation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of such embeddings. Based on our entity embeddings, we achieved new sate-of-the-art performance on entity linking."

In this paper, we focus on English-Turkish literary translation and develop machine translation models that take into account the stylistic features of translators. We fine-tune a pre-trained machine translation model by the manually-aligned works of a particular translator. We make a detailed analysis of the effects of manual and automatic alignments, data augmentation methods, and corpus size on the translations. We propose an approach based on stylistic features to evaluate the style of a translator in the output translations. We show that the human translator style can be highly recreated in the target machine translations by adapting the models to the style of the translator."

Furthermore, existing work has not provided a clear picture about the model properties required to produce proper syntactic generalizations. We present a systematic evaluation of the syntactic knowledge of neural language models, testing 20 combinations of model types and data sizes on a set of 34 English-language syntactic test suites. We find substantial differences in syntactic generalization performance by model architecture, with sequential models underperforming other architectures. Factorially manipulating model architecture and training dataset size (1M--40M words), we find that variability in syntactic generalization performance is substantially greater by architecture than by dataset size for the corpora tested in our experiments. Our results also reveal a dissociation between perplexity and syntactic generalization performance."

While this challenge has attracted significant recent interest, existing methods either lack realism, produce unrealistic shapes, or do not support editing, such as modifications to the hairstyle. We argue that existing methods are limited because they employ a monolithic modeling approach, using a single representation for the head, face, hair, and accessories. Our observation is that the hair and face, for example, have very different structural qualities that benefit from different representations. Building on this insight, we generate avatars with a compositional model, in which the head, face, and upper body are represented with traditional 3D meshes, and the hair, clothing, and accessories with neural radiance fields (NeRF). The model-based mesh representation provides a strong geometric prior for the face region, improving realism while enabling editing of the person's appearance. By using NeRFs to represent the remaining components, our method is able to model and synthesize parts with complex geometry and appearance, such as curly hair and fluffy scarves. Our novel system synthesizes these high-quality compositional avatars from text descriptions. The experimental results demonstrate that our method, Text-guided generation and Editing of Compositional Avatars (TECA), produces avatars that are more realistic than those of recent methods while being editable because of their compositional nature. For example, our TECA enables the seamless transfer of compositional features like hairstyles, scarves, and other accessories between avatars. This capability supports applications such as virtual try-on."

Some interactions are expected, because they largely follow users' long-term preferences. Some other interactions are indications of recent trends in user preference changes or marketing positions of new items. Accordingly, the recommender needs to be periodically retrained or updated to capture the new trends, and yet not to forget the long-term preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic retraining framework called Disentangled Incremental Learning (DIL) for graph-based recommenders. We assume that long-term preferences are well captured in the existing model, in the form of model parameters learned from past interactions. New preferences can be learned from the user-item bipartite graph constructed using the newly observed interactions. In DIL, we design an Information Extraction Module to extract historical preferences from the existing model. Then we blend the historical and new preferences in the form of node embeddings in the new graph, through a Disentanglement Module. The essence of the disentanglement module is to decorrelate the historical and new preferences so that both can be well captured, via carefully designed losses. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets, we show the effectiveness of DIL in capturing dynamics of useritem interactions. We also demonstrate the robustness of DIL by attaching it to two base models - LightGCN and NGCF."

In addition, we incorporate Slot Type Informed Descriptions that capture the shared information across slots to facilitate cross-domain knowledge transfer.

We propose a framework that trains neural lattice language models to provide contextualized representations for spoken language understanding tasks. The proposed two-stage pre-training approach reduces the demands of speech data and has better efficiency. Experiments on intent detection and dialogue act recognition datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms strong baselines when evaluated on spoken inputs.

The extracted dialogue structure and process can help analyze human dialogue, and play a vital role in the design and evaluation of dialogue systems. The traditional dialogue system requires experts to manually design the dialogue structure, which is very costly. But through unsupervised dialogue structure learning, dialogue structure can be automatically obtained, reducing the cost of developers constructing dialogue process. The learned dialogue structure can be used to promote the dialogue generation of the downstream task system, and improve the logic and consistency of the dialogue robot's reply.In this paper, we propose a Bert-based unsupervised dialogue structure learning algorithm DSBERT (Dialogue Structure BERT). Different from the previous SOTA models VRNN and SVRNN, we combine BERT and AutoEncoder, which can effectively combine context information. In order to better prevent the model from falling into the local optimal solution and make the dialogue state distribution more uniform and reasonable, we also propose three balanced loss functions that can be used for dialogue structure learning. Experimental results show that DSBERT can generate a dialogue structure closer to the real structure, can distinguish sentences with different semantics and map them to different hidden states."

However, it is still challenging to associate source-target sentences in the latent space. As people speak different languages biologically share similar visual systems, the potential of achieving better alignment through visual content is promising yet under-explored in unsupervised multimodal MT (MMT). In this paper, we investigate how to utilize visual content for disambiguation and promoting latent space alignment in unsupervised MMT. Our model employs multimodal back-translation and features pseudo visual pivoting in which we learn a shared multilingual visual-semantic embedding space and incorporate visually-pivoted captioning as additional weak supervision.

This is insufficient for training intermediate dialogue turns since supervision signals (or rewards) are only provided at the end of dialogues. To address this issue, reward learning has been introduced to learn from state-action pairs of an optimal policy to provide turn-by-turn rewards. This approach requires complete state-action annotations of human-to-human dialogues (i.e., expert demonstrations), which is labor intensive. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel reward learning approach for semi-supervised policy learning. The proposed approach learns a dynamics model as the reward function which models dialogue progress (i.e., state-action sequences) based on expert demonstrations, either with or without annotations. The dynamics model computes rewards by predicting whether the dialogue progress is consistent with expert demonstrations. We further propose to learn action embeddings for a better generalization of the reward function. The proposed approach outperforms competitive policy learning baselines on MultiWOZ, a benchmark multi-domain dataset."

Although the image can be well represented by deep learning, the question is always simply embedded and cannot well indicate its meaning. Besides, the visual and textual features have a gap for different modalities, it is difficult to align and utilize the cross-modality information. In this paper, we focus on these two problems and propose a Graph Matching Attention (GMA) network. Firstly, it not only builds graph for the image, but also constructs graph for the question in terms of both syntactic and embedding information. Next, we explore the intra-modality relationships by a dual-stage graph encoder and then present a bilateral cross-modality graph matching attention to infer the relationships between the image and the question. The updated cross-modality features are then sent into the answer prediction module for final answer prediction. Experiments demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GQA dataset and the VQA 2.0 dataset. The ablation studies verify the effectiveness of each modules in our GMA network."

We argue that, to address these issues, the summarizer should acquire semantic interpretation over input, e.g., via structured representation, to allow the generation of more informative summaries. In this paper, we present ASGARD, a novel framework for Abstractive Summarization with Graph-Augmentation and semantic-driven RewarD. We propose the use of dual encoders---a sequential document encoder and a graph-structured encoder---to maintain the global context and local characteristics of entities, complementing each other. We further design a reward based on a multiple choice cloze test to drive the model to better capture entity interactions. Results show that our models produce significantly higher ROUGE scores than a variant without knowledge graph as input on both New York Times and CNN/Daily Mail datasets. We also obtain better or comparable performance compared to systems that are fine-tuned from large pretrained language models. Human judges further rate our model outputs as more informative and containing fewer unfaithful errors."

This paper surveys a few conventions for imputation as available in the Automunge open source python library platform for tabular data preprocessing, including ""ML infill"" in which auto ML models are trained for target features from partitioned extracts of a training set. A series of validation experiments were performed to benchmark imputation scenarios towards downstream model performance, in which it was found for the given benchmark sets that in many cases ML infill outperformed for both numeric and categoric target features, and was otherwise at minimum within noise distributions of the other imputation scenarios. Evidence also suggested supplementing ML infill with the addition of support columns with boolean integer markers signaling presence of infill was usually beneficial to downstream model performance. We consider these results sufficient to recommend defaulting to ML infill for tabular learning, and further recommend supplementing imputations with support columns signaling presence of infill, each as can be prepared with push-button operation in the Automunge library. Our contributions include an auto ML derived missing data imputation library for tabular learning in the python ecosystem, fully integrated into a preprocessing platform with an extensive library of feature transformations, with a novel production friendly implementation that bases imputation models on a designated train set for consistent basis towards additional data."

Different to conventional reranking parsing, the model searches for the best dependency tree in all feasible trees constraining by a sequence of actions to get the future reward of the sequence. The scorer is based on a first-order graph-based parser with bidirectional LSTM, which catches different parsing view compared with the transition-based parser. Besides, since context enhancement has shown substantial improvement in the arc-stand transition-based parsing over the parsing accuracy, we implement context enhancement on an arc-eager transition-base parser with stack LSTMs, the dynamic oracle and dropout supporting and achieve further improvement. With the global scorer and context enhancement, the results show that UAS of the parser increases as much as 1.20% for English and 1.66% for Chinese, and LAS increases as much as 1.32% for English and 1.63% for Chinese. Moreover, we get state-of-the-art LASs, achieving 87.58% for Chinese and 93.37% for English."

In particular, representations encoded in models often inadvertently perpetuate undesirable social biases from the data on which they are trained. In this paper, we present evidence of such undesirable biases towards mentions of disability in two different English language models: toxicity prediction and sentiment analysis. Next, we demonstrate that the neural embeddings that are the critical first step in most NLP pipelines similarly contain undesirable biases towards mentions of disability. We end by highlighting topical biases in the discourse about disability which may contribute to the observed model biases; for instance, gun violence, homelessness, and drug addiction are over-represented in texts discussing mental illness."

This prevents the community from reliably measuring the progress of RC systems. To address this issue, we introduce R4C, a new task for evaluating RC systems' internal reasoning. R4C requires giving not only answers but also derivations: explanations that justify predicted answers. We present a reliable, crowdsourced framework for scalably annotating RC datasets with derivations. We create and publicly release the R4C dataset, the first, quality-assured dataset consisting of 4.6k questions, each of which is annotated with 3 reference derivations (i.e. 13.8k derivations). Experiments show that our automatic evaluation metrics using multiple reference derivations are reliable, and that R4C assesses different skills from an existing benchmark."

The capabilities of humans and automatic discriminators to detect machine-generated text have been a large source of research interest, but humans and machines rely on different cues to make their decisions. Here, we perform careful benchmarking and analysis of three popular sampling-based decoding strategies---top-$k$, nucleus sampling, and untruncated random sampling---and show that improvements in decoding methods have primarily optimized for fooling humans. This comes at the expense of introducing statistical abnormalities that make detection easy for automatic systems. We also show that though both human and automatic detector performance improve with longer excerpt length, even multi-sentence excerpts can fool expert human raters over 30% of the time. Our findings reveal the importance of using both human and automatic detectors to assess the humanness of text generation systems."
283,acl,2020,Toward Better Storylines with Sentence-Level Language Models,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.666,"Automatic storytelling is challenging since it requires generating long, coherent natural language to describes a sensible sequence of events. Despite considerable efforts on automatic story generation in the past, prior work either is restricted in plot planning, or can only generate stories in a narrow domain. In this paper, we explore open-domain story generation that writes stories given a title (topic) as input. We propose a plan-and-write hierarchical generation framework that first plans a storyline, and then generates a story based on the storyline. We compare two planning strategies. The dynamic schema interweaves story planning and its surface realization in text, while the static schema plans out the entire storyline before generating stories. Experiments show that with explicit storyline planning, the generated stories are more diverse, coherent, and on topic than those generated without creating a full plan, according to both automatic and human evaluations."

In this paper, we aim to analyze and interpret what is changed during the transfer process. We start from the observation that in many existing models and datasets, certain words within a sentence play important roles in determining the sentence attribute class. These words are referred to as \textit{the Pivot Words}. Based on these pivot words, we propose a lexical analysis framework, \textit{the Pivot Analysis}, to quantitatively analyze the effects of these words in text attribute classification and transfer. We apply this framework to existing datasets and models and show that: (1) the pivot words are strong features for the classification of sentence attributes; (2) to change the attribute of a sentence, many datasets only requires to change certain pivot words; (3) consequently, many transfer models only perform the lexical-level modification, while leaving higher-level sentence structures unchanged. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of linguistic attribute transfer and further identifies the future requirements and challenges of this task\footnote{Our code can be found at https://github.com/FranxYao/pivot_analysis}."

A crucial part of writing is editing and revising the text. Previous works on text revision have focused on defining edit intention taxonomies within a single domain or developing computational models with a single level of edit granularity, such as sentence-level edits, which differ from human's revision cycles. This work describes IteraTeR: the first large-scale, multi-domain, edit-intention annotated corpus of iteratively revised text. In particular, IteraTeR is collected based on a new framework to comprehensively model the iterative text revisions that generalize to various domains of formal writing, edit intentions, revision depths, and granularities. When we incorporate our annotated edit intentions, both generative and edit-based text revision models significantly improve automatic evaluations. Through our work, we better understand the text revision process, making vital connections between edit intentions and writing quality, enabling the creation of diverse corpora to support computational modeling of iterative text revisions."

However, the existing neural topic models is difficult to retain representative information of the documents within the learnt topic representation. In this paper, we propose a neural topic model which incorporates deep mutual information estimation, i.e., Neural Topic Modeling with Deep Mutual Information Estimation(NTM-DMIE). NTM-DMIE is a neural network method for topic learning which maximizes the mutual information between the input documents and their latent topic representation. To learn robust topic representation, we incorporate the discriminator to discriminate negative examples and positive examples via adversarial learning. Moreover, we use both global and local mutual information to preserve the rich information of the input documents in the topic representation. We evaluate NTM-DMIE on several metrics, including accuracy of text clustering, with topic representation, topic uniqueness and topic coherence. Compared to the existing methods, the experimental results show that NTM-DMIE can outperform in all the metrics on the four datasets."

We propose CONPONO, an inter-sentence objective for pretraining language models that models discourse coherence and the distance between sentences. Given an anchor sentence, our model is trained to predict the text k sentences away using a sampled-softmax objective where the candidates consist of neighboring sentences and sentences randomly sampled from the corpus. On the discourse representation benchmark DiscoEval, our model improves over the previous state-of-the-art by up to 13% and on average 4% absolute across 7 tasks. Our model is the same size as BERT-Base, but outperforms the much larger BERT- Large model and other more recent approaches that incorporate discourse. We also show that CONPONO yields gains of 2%-6% absolute even for tasks that do not explicitly evaluate discourse: textual entailment (RTE), common sense reasoning (COPA) and reading comprehension (ReCoRD)."

But what is interpretability, and what constitutes a high-quality interpretation? In this opinion piece we reflect on the current state of interpretability evaluation research. We call for more clearly differentiating between different desired criteria an interpretation should satisfy, and focus on the faithfulness criteria. We survey the literature with respect to faithfulness evaluation, and arrange the current approaches around three assumptions, providing an explicit form to how faithfulness is ""defined"" by the community. We provide concrete guidelines on how evaluation of interpretation methods should and should not be conducted. Finally, we claim that the current binary definition for faithfulness sets a potentially unrealistic bar for being considered faithful. We call for discarding the binary notion of faithfulness in favor of a more graded one, which we believe will be of greater practical utility."

It is important that NLP applications such as named entity recognition and question answering produce calibrated confidence scores for their predictions, especially if the system is to be deployed in a safety-critical domain such as healthcare. However, the output space of such structured prediction models is often too large to adapt binary or multi-class calibration methods directly. In this study, we propose a general calibration scheme for output entities of interest in neural-network based structured prediction models. Our proposed method can be used with any binary class calibration scheme and a neural network model. Additionally, we show that our calibration method can also be used as an uncertainty-aware, entity-specific decoding step to improve the performance of the underlying model at no additional training cost or data requirements. We show that our method outperforms current calibration techniques for named-entity-recognition, part-of-speech and question answering. We also improve our model's performance from our decoding step across several tasks and benchmark datasets. Our method improves the calibration and model performance on out-of-domain test scenarios as well."

It is also shown that conversely it is decidable whether an N-rational series corresponds to a rational abstract numeration system."

In machine translation, each language is considered a domain with its own word embedding. The alignment between word embeddings allows linking semantically equivalent words in multilingual contexts. Moreover, it offers a way to infer cross-lingual meaning for words without a direct translation. Current methods for word embedding alignment are either supervised, i.e. they require known word pairs, or learn a cross-domain transformation on fixed embeddings in an unsupervised way. Here we propose an end-to-end approach for word embedding alignment that does not require known word pairs. Our method, termed Word Alignment through MMD (WAM), learns embeddings that are aligned during sentence translation training using a localized Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) constraint between the embeddings. We show that our method not only out-performs unsupervised methods, but also supervised methods that train on known word translations."

Collaborative building is one of such tasks. We wish to develop an intelligent builder agent in a simulated building environment (Minecraft) that can build whatever users wish to build by just talking to the agent. In order to achieve this goal, such agents need to be able to take the initiative by asking clarification questions when further information is needed. Existing works on Minecraft Corpus Dataset only learn to execute instructions neglecting the importance of asking for clarifications. In this paper, we extend the Minecraft Corpus Dataset by annotating all builder utterances into eight types, including clarification questions, and propose a new builder agent model capable of determining when to ask or execute instructions. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the collaborative building task with a substantial improvement. We also define two new tasks, the learning to ask task and the joint learning task. The latter consists of solving both collaborating building and learning to ask tasks jointly."

Learning IMPlicature and PRESupposition,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.768,"Natural language inference (NLI) is an increasingly important task for natural language understanding, which requires one to infer whether a sentence entails another. However, the ability of NLI models to make pragmatic inferences remains understudied. We create an IMPlicature and PRESupposition diagnostic dataset (IMPPRES), consisting of >25k semiautomatically generated sentence pairs illustrating well-studied pragmatic inference types. We use IMPPRES to evaluate whether BERT, InferSent, and BOW NLI models trained on MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) learn to make pragmatic inferences. Although MultiNLI appears to contain very few pairs illustrating these inference types, we find that BERT learns to draw pragmatic inferences. It reliably treats scalar implicatures triggered by ""some"" as entailments. For some presupposition triggers like ""only"", BERT reliably recognizes the presupposition as an entailment, even when the trigger is embedded under an entailment canceling operator like negation. BOW and InferSent show weaker evidence of pragmatic reasoning. We conclude that NLI training encourages models to learn some, but not all, pragmatic inferences."

Nevertheless, recent studies, e.g., Zhao et al. (2017) show that these techniques inadvertently capture the societal bias hidden in the corpus and further amplify it. However, their analysis is conducted only on models' top predictions. In this paper, we investigate the gender bias amplification issue from the distribution perspective and demonstrate that the bias is amplified in the view of predicted probability distribution over labels. We further propose a bias mitigation approach based on posterior regularization. With little performance loss, our method can almost remove the bias amplification in the distribution. Our study sheds the light on understanding the bias amplification."

However, most of the existing NER benchmarks lack domain-specialized entity types or do not focus on a certain domain, leading to a less effective cross-domain evaluation. To address these obstacles, we introduce a cross-domain NER dataset (CrossNER), a fully-labeled collection of NER data spanning over five diverse domains with specialized entity categories for different domains. Additionally, we also provide a domain-related corpus since using it to continue pre-training language models (domain-adaptive pre-training) is effective for the domain adaptation. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the effectiveness of leveraging different levels of the domain corpus and pre-training strategies to do domain-adaptive pre-training for the cross-domain task. Results show that focusing on the fractional corpus containing domain-specialized entities and utilizing a more challenging pre-training strategy in domain-adaptive pre-training are beneficial for the NER domain adaptation, and our proposed method can consistently outperform existing cross-domain NER baselines. Nevertheless, experiments also illustrate the challenge of this cross-domain NER task. We hope that our dataset and baselines will catalyze research in the NER domain adaptation area.

This paper proposes a novel framework to jointly model Chinese variational, semantic, and contextualized representations for Chinese text spam detection task. In particular, a Variation Family-enhanced Graph Embedding (VFGE) algorithm is designed based on a Chinese character variation graph. The VFGE can learn both the graph embeddings of the Chinese characters (local) and the latent variation families (global). Furthermore, an enhanced bidirectional language model, with a combination gate function and an aggregation learning function, is proposed to integrate the graph and text information while capturing the sequential information.

Many existing state-of-the-art models are first pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. However, due to limited data resources from downstream tasks and the extremely large capacity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the adapted model to overfit the data of downstream tasks and forget the knowledge of the pre-trained model. To address the above issue in a more principled manner, we propose a new computational framework for robust and efficient fine-tuning for pre-trained language models. Specifically, our proposed framework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing regularization, which effectively manages the capacity of the model; 2. Bregman proximal point optimization, which is a class of trust-region methods and can prevent knowledge forgetting. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple NLP benchmarks."

To evaluate and improve sentence alignment quality, we create two manually annotated sentence-aligned datasets from two commonly used text simplification corpora, Newsela and Wikipedia. We propose a novel neural CRF alignment model which not only leverages the sequential nature of sentences in parallel documents but also utilizes a neural sentence pair model to capture semantic similarity. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all the previous work on monolingual sentence alignment task by more than 5 points in F1. We apply our CRF aligner to construct two new text simplification datasets, Newsela-Auto and Wiki-Auto, which are much larger and of better quality compared to the existing datasets.

Unlike previous state-of-the-art models, the semantic information is interpreted as the latent dependency between the natural language words in our joint representation. Such dependency information can capture the interactions between the semantics and natural language words. We integrate a neural component into our model and propose an efficient dynamic-programming algorithm to perform tractable inference.

From a natural language processing (NLP) perspective, this is a challenging unsupervised task, and high-performing systems have the potential to improve tools for low-resource languages or to assist linguistic annotators. From a cognitive science perspective, this can shed light on how children acquire morphological knowledge. We further introduce a system for the task, which generates morphological paradigms via the following steps: (i) EDIT TREE retrieval, (ii) additional lemma retrieval, (iii) paradigm size discovery, and (iv) inflection generation. We perform an evaluation on 14 typologically diverse languages.

With no style-specific article-headline pair (only a standard headline summarization dataset and mono-style corpora), our method TitleStylist generates style-specific headlines by combining the summarization and reconstruction tasks into a multitasking framework. We also introduced a novel parameter sharing scheme to further disentangle the style from the text. Through both automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that TitleStylist can generate relevant, fluent headlines with three target styles: humor, romance, and clickbait.

Recently, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many clinical NLP tasks. However, training deep learning models usually requires large annotated datasets, which are normally not publicly available and can be time-consuming to build in clinical domains. Working with smaller annotated datasets is typical in clinical NLP and therefore, ensuring that deep learning models perform well is crucial for the models to be used in real-world applications. A widely adopted approach is fine-tuning existing Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), but these attempts fall short when the training dataset contains only a few annotated samples. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has recently been investigated to tackle this problem. Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been widely utilized as an FSL approach in computer vision, but has not been studied well in NLP. Furthermore, the literature on its applications in clinical domains is scarce. In this paper, we propose two SNN-based FSL approaches for clinical NLP, including Pre-Trained SNN (PT-SNN) and SNN with Second-Order Embeddings (SOE-SNN). We evaluated the proposed approaches on two clinical tasks, namely clinical text classification and clinical named entity recognition. We tested three few-shot settings including 4-shot, 8-shot, and 16-shot learning. Both clinical NLP tasks were benchmarked using three PLMs, including BERT,BioBERT, and BioClinicalBERT. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed SNN-based FSL approaches in both NLP tasks."

Self-supervised pretrained models are often fine-tuned on parallel data from one or multiple language pairs for machine translation. Multilingual fine-tuning improves performance on low-resource languages but requires modifying the entire model and can be prohibitively expensive. Training a new adapter on each language pair or training a single adapter on all language pairs without updating the pretrained model has been proposed as a parameter-efficient alternative. However, the former does not permit any sharing between languages, while the latter shares parameters for all languages and is susceptible to negative interference. In this paper, we propose training language-family adapters on top of mBART-50 to facilitate cross-lingual transfer. Our approach outperforms related baselines, yielding higher translation scores on average when translating from English to 17 different low-resource languages. We also show that language-family adapters provide an effective method to translate to languages unseen during pretraining."

We consider several approaches to learning discrete latent variable models for text in the case where exact marginalization over these variables is intractable. We compare the performance of the learned representations as features for low-resource document and sentence classification. Our best models outperform the previous best reported results with continuous representations in these low-resource settings, while learning significantly more compressed representations.

In multi-head attention mechanism, different heads attend to different parts of the input. However, the limitation is that multiple heads might attend to the same part of the input, resulting in multiple heads being redundant. Thus, the model resources are under-utilized. One approach to avoid this is to prune least important heads based on certain importance score. In this work, we focus on designing a Dynamic Head Importance Computation Mechanism (DHICM) to dynamically calculate the importance of a head with respect to the input. Our insight is to design an additional attention layer together with multi-head attention, and utilize the outputs of the multi-head attention along with the input, to compute the importance for each head. Additionally, we add an extra loss function to prevent the model from assigning same score to all heads, to identify more important heads and improvise performance. We analyzed performance of DHICM for NMT with different languages. Experiments on different datasets show that DHICM outperforms traditional Transformer-based approach by large margin, especially, when less training data is available."
311,acl,2020,Robust Encodings: A Framework for Combating Adversarial Typos,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.245,"Despite excellent performance on many tasks, NLP systems are easily fooled by small adversarial perturbations of inputs. Existing procedures to defend against such perturbations are either (i) heuristic in nature and susceptible to stronger attacks or (ii) provide guaranteed robustness to worst-case attacks, but are incompatible with state-of-the-art models like BERT. In this work, we introduce robust encodings (RobEn): a simple framework that confers guaranteed robustness, without making compromises on model architecture. The core component of RobEn is an encoding function, which maps sentences to a smaller, discrete space of encodings. Systems using these encodings as a bottleneck confer guaranteed robustness with standard training, and the same encodings can be used across multiple tasks. We identify two desiderata to construct robust encoding functions: perturbations of a sentence should map to a small set of encodings (stability), and models using encodings should still perform well (fidelity). We instantiate RobEn to defend against a large family of adversarial typos. Across six tasks from GLUE, our instantiation of RobEn paired with BERT achieves an average robust accuracy of 71.3% against all adversarial typos in the family considered, while previous work using a typo-corrector achieves only 35.3% accuracy against a simple greedy attack."
312,acl,2020,When do Word Embeddings Accurately Reflect Surveys on our Beliefs About People?,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.405,"Social biases are encoded in word embeddings. This presents a unique opportunity to study society historically and at scale, and a unique danger when embeddings are used in downstream applications. Here, we investigate the extent to which publicly-available word embeddings accurately reflect beliefs about certain kinds of people as measured via traditional survey methods. We find that biases found in word embeddings do, on average, closely mirror survey data across seventeen dimensions of social meaning. However, we also find that biases in embeddings are much more reflective of survey data for some dimensions of meaning (e.g. gender) than others (e.g. race), and that we can be highly confident that embedding-based measures reflect survey data only for the most salient biases."

However, only a very small number of the over 7000 languages of the world are represented in the rapidly evolving language technologies and applications. In this paper we look at the relation between the types of languages, resources, and their representation in NLP conferences to understand the trajectory that different languages have followed over time. Our quantitative investigation underlines the disparity between languages, especially in terms of their resources, and calls into question the ""language agnostic"" status of current models and systems. Through this paper, we attempt to convince the ACL community to prioritise the resolution of the predicaments highlighted here, so that no language is left behind."
314,acl,2020,Posterior Calibrated Training on Sentence Classification Tasks,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.242,"Most classification models work by first predicting a posterior probability distribution over all classes and then selecting that class with the largest estimated probability. In many settings however, the quality of posterior probability itself (e.g., 65% chance having diabetes), gives more reliable information than the final predicted class alone. When these methods are shown to be poorly calibrated, most fixes to date have relied on posterior calibration, which rescales the predicted probabilities but often has little impact on final classifications. Here we propose an end-to-end training procedure called posterior calibrated (PosCal) training that directly optimizes the objective while minimizing the difference between the predicted and empirical posterior probabilities.We show that PosCal not only helps reduce the calibration error but also improve task performance by penalizing drops in performance of both objectives. Our PosCal achieves about 2.5% of task performance gain and 16.1% of calibration error reduction on GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) compared to the baseline. We achieved the comparable task performance with 13.2% calibration error reduction on xSLUE (Kang and Hovy, 2019), but not outperforming the two-stage calibration baseline. PosCal training can be easily extendable to any types of classification tasks as a form of regularization term. Also, PosCal has the advantage that it incrementally tracks needed statistics for the calibration objective during the training process, making efficient use of large training sets."

Through our analysis of over 1.3 million ads with political content, we show how different types of political advertisers are disseminating U.S. political messages using Facebook, Google, and Twitter's advertising platforms. We find that in total, ads with political content included in these archives have generated between 8.67 billion - 33.8 billion impressions and that sponsors have spent over $300 million USD on advertising with U.S. political content.   We are able to improve our understanding of political advertisers on these platforms. We have also discovered a significant amount of advertising by quasi for-profit media companies that appeared to exist for the sole purpose of creating deceptive online communities focused on spreading political messaging and not for directly generating profits. Advertising by such groups is a relatively recent phenomenon, and appears to be thriving on online platforms due to the lower regulatory requirements compared to traditional advertising platforms.   We have found through our attempts to collect and analyze this data that there are many limitations and weaknesses that enable intentional or accidental deception and bypassing of the current implementations of these transparency archives. We provide several suggestions for how these archives could be made more robust and useful. Overall, these efforts by Facebook, Google, and Twitter have improved political advertising transparency of honest and, in some cases, possibly dishonest advertisers on their platforms. We thank the people at these companies who have built these archives and continue to improve them."
316,acl,2020,Selective Question Answering under Domain Shift,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.503,"To avoid giving wrong answers, question answering (QA) models need to know when to abstain from answering. Moreover, users often ask questions that diverge from the model's training data, making errors more likely and thus abstention more critical. In this work, we propose the setting of selective question answering under domain shift, in which a QA model is tested on a mixture of in-domain and out-of-domain data, and must answer (i.e., not abstain on) as many questions as possible while maintaining high accuracy. Abstention policies based solely on the model's softmax probabilities fare poorly, since models are overconfident on out-of-domain inputs. Instead, we train a calibrator to identify inputs on which the QA model errs, and abstain when it predicts an error is likely. Crucially, the calibrator benefits from observing the model's behavior on out-of-domain data, even if from a different domain than the test data. We combine this method with a SQuAD-trained QA model and evaluate on mixtures of SQuAD and five other QA datasets. Our method answers 56% of questions while maintaining 80% accuracy; in contrast, directly using the model's probabilities only answers 48% at 80% accuracy."

318,acl,2020,Improved Natural Language Generation via Loss Truncation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.66,"Neural language models are usually trained to match the distributional properties of a large-scale corpus by minimizing the log loss. While straightforward to optimize, this approach forces the model to reproduce all variations in the dataset, including noisy and invalid references (e.g., misannotation and hallucinated facts). Worse, the commonly used log loss is overly sensitive to such phenomena and even a small fraction of noisy data can degrade performance. In this work, we show that the distinguishability of the models and reference serves as a principled and robust alternative for handling invalid references. To optimize distinguishability, we propose loss truncation, which adaptively removes high loss examples during training. We show this is as easy to optimize as log loss and tightly bounds distinguishability under noise. Empirically, we demonstrate that loss truncation outperforms existing baselines on distinguishability on a summarization task, and show that samples generated by the loss truncation model have factual accuracy ratings that exceed those of baselines and match human references."

State-of-the-art approaches for knowledge extraction were each designed for a single category of product, and thus do not apply to real-life e-Commerce scenarios, which often contain thousands of diverse categories. This paper proposes TXtract, a taxonomy-aware knowledge extraction model that applies to thousands of product categories organized in a hierarchical taxonomy. Through category conditional self-attention and multi-task learning, our approach is both scalable, as it trains a single model for thousands of categories, and effective, as it extracts category-specific attribute values. Experiments on products from a taxonomy with 4,000 categories show that TXtract outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by up to 10% in F1 and 15% in coverage across all categories."

We find that PLMs do not distinguish between negated (""Birds cannot [MASK]"") and non-negated (""Birds can [MASK]"") cloze questions. (2) Mispriming. Inspired by priming methods in human psychology, we add ""misprimes"" to cloze questions (""Talk? Birds can [MASK]""). We find that PLMs are easily distracted by misprimes. These results suggest that PLMs still have a long way to go to adequately learn human-like factual knowledge."

For example, IOB-format entity labels, such as B-Person and I-Person, can be decomposed into span (B and I) and type information (Person). However, while most sequence labeling models do not consider such label components, the shared components across labels, such as Person, can be beneficial for label prediction. In this work, we propose to integrate label component information as embeddings into models. Through experiments on English and Japanese fine-grained named entity recognition, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance, especially for instances with low-frequency labels."

In this work, we propose a deep generative model to generate paraphrase with diversity. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. An additional transcoder is used to convert a sentence into its paraphrasing latent code. The transcoder takes an explicit pattern embedding variable as condition, so diverse paraphrase can be generated by sampling on the pattern embedding variable. We use a Wasserstein GAN to align the distributions of the real and generated paraphrase samples. We propose a multi-class extension to the Wasserstein GAN, which allows our generative model to learn from both positive and negative samples. The generated paraphrase distribution is forced to get closer to the positive real distribution, and be pushed away from the negative distribution in Wasserstein distance. We test our model in two datasets with both automatic metrics and human evaluation. Results show that our model can generate fluent and reliable paraphrase samples that outperform the state-of-art results, while also provides reasonable variability and diversity."

Such observational data often contains confounders, variables that influence both potential causes and potential effects. Unmeasured or latent confounders can bias causal estimates, and this has motivated interest in measuring potential confounders from observed text. For example, an individual's entire history of social media posts or the content of a news article could provide a rich measurement of multiple confounders. Yet, methods and applications for this problem are scattered across different communities and evaluation practices are inconsistent. This review is the first to gather and categorize these examples and provide a guide to data-processing and evaluation decisions. Despite increased attention on adjusting for confounding using text, there are still many open problems, which we highlight in this paper."

This ability is challenging but indispensable to achieve general VQA. One limitation of existing KVQA solutions is that they jointly embed all kinds of information without fine-grained selection, which introduces unexpected noises for reasoning the correct answer. How to capture the question-oriented and information-complementary evidence remains a key challenge to solve the problem. Inspired by the human cognition theory, in this paper, we depict an image by multiple knowledge graphs from the visual, semantic and factual views. Thereinto, the visual graph and semantic graph are regarded as image-conditioned instantiation of the factual graph. On top of these new representations, we re-formulate Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering as a recurrent reasoning process for obtaining complementary evidence from multimodal information. To this end, we decompose the model into a series of memory-based reasoning steps, each performed by a G raph-based R ead, U pdate, and C ontrol ( GRUC ) module that conducts parallel reasoning over both visual and semantic information. By stacking the modules multiple times, our model performs transitive reasoning and obtains question-oriented concept representations under the constrain of different modalities. Finally, we perform graph neural networks to infer the global-optimal answer by jointly considering all the concepts. We achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on three popular benchmark datasets, including FVQA, Visual7W-KB and OK-VQA, and demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model with extensive experiments."

For the prosperity of the NLP community, in this paper, we introduce the WYWEB evaluation benchmark, which consists of nine NLP tasks in classical Chinese, implementing sentence classifi cation, sequence labeling, reading comprehension, and machine translation. We evaluate the existing pre-trained language models, which are all struggling with this benchmark.

Understanding the role of each and the interplay between them is crucial for obtaining insights regarding argument interpretation and generation. It is particularly important for building effective argument generation systems that can take both the discourse and the audience characteristics into account. Having such personalized argument generation systems would be helpful to expose individuals to different viewpoints and help them make a more fair and informed decision on an issue. Even though studies in Social Sciences and Psychology have shown that source and audience effects are essential components of the persuasion process, most research in computational persuasion has focused solely on understanding the characteristics of persuasive language. In this thesis, we make several contributions to understand the relative effect of the source, audience, and language in computational persuasion. We first introduce a large-scale dataset with extensive user information to study these factors' effects simultaneously. Then, we propose models to understand the role of the audience's prior beliefs on their perception of arguments. We also investigate the role of social interactions and engagement in understanding users' success in online debating over time. We find that the users' prior beliefs and social interactions play an essential role in predicting their success in persuasion. Finally, we explore the importance of incorporating contextual information to predict argument impact and show improvements compared to encoding only the text of the arguments."

Recent work has shown that contextual representations like BERT perform well on tasks that require sensitivity to linguistic structure. We present here two studies which aim to provide a better understanding of the nature of BERT's representations. The first of these focuses on the identification of structurally-defined elements using diagnostic classifiers, while the second explores BERT's representation of subject-verb agreement and anaphor-antecedent dependencies through a quantitative assessment of self-attention vectors. In both cases, we find that BERT encodes positional information about word tokens well on its lower layers, but switches to a hierarchically-oriented encoding on higher layers. We conclude then that BERT's representations do indeed model linguistically relevant aspects of hierarchical structure, though they do not appear to show the sharp sensitivity to hierarchical structure that is found in human processing of reflexive anaphora."

Given ChatGPT's promising performance across various tasks, we conduct extensive evaluations on the whole test sets of 13 datasets, including temporal and causal relations, PDTB2.0-based and dialogue-based discourse relations, and downstream applications on discourse understanding. To achieve reliable results, we adopt three tailored prompt templates for each task, including the zero-shot prompt template, zero-shot prompt engineering (PE) template, and in-context learning (ICL) prompt template, to establish the initial baseline scores for all popular sentence-pair relation classification tasks for the first time. We find that ChatGPT exhibits strong performance in detecting and reasoning about causal relations, while it may not be proficient in identifying the temporal order between two events. It can recognize most discourse relations with existing explicit discourse connectives, but the implicit discourse relation still remains a challenging task. Meanwhile, ChatGPT performs poorly in the dialogue discourse parsing task that requires structural understanding in a dialogue before being aware of the discourse relation."

However, Korean NLP research has focused on South Korean only, and existing NLP systems of the Korean language, such as neural machine translation (NMT) models, cannot properly handle North Korean inputs. Training a model using North Korean data is the most straightforward approach to solving this problem, but there is insufficient data to train NMT models. In this study, we create data for North Korean NMT models using a comparable corpus. First, we manually create evaluation data for automatic alignment and machine translation. Then, we investigate automatic alignment methods suitable for North Korean. Finally, we verify that a model trained by North Korean bilingual data without human annotation can significantly boost North Korean translation accuracy compared to existing South Korean models in zero-shot settings."

However, storing and accessing these embeddings requires a large amount of space. This is not conducive to the deployment of these models on resource-limited devices. Combining the powerful compression capability of tensor products, we propose a word embedding compression method with morphological augmentation, Morphologically-enhanced Tensorized Embeddings (MorphTE). A word consists of one or more morphemes, the smallest units that bear meaning or have a grammatical function. MorphTE represents a word embedding as an entangled form of its morpheme vectors via the tensor product, which injects prior semantic and grammatical knowledge into the learning of embeddings. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the morpheme vector and the number of morphemes are much smaller than those of words, which greatly reduces the parameters of the word embeddings. We conduct experiments on tasks such as machine translation and question answering. Experimental results on four translation datasets of different languages show that MorphTE can compress word embedding parameters by about 20 times without performance loss and significantly outperforms related embedding compression methods."

Dynamic spatio-temporal relationships between people/objects, and diverse multimodal events are present in a video clip. Hence, it is important to develop automated models that can accurately extract such information from videos. Answering questions on videos is one of the tasks which can evaluate such AI abilities. In this paper, we propose a video question answering model which effectively integrates multi-modal input sources and finds the temporally relevant information to answer questions. Specifically, we first employ dense image captions to help identify objects and their detailed salient regions and actions, and hence give the model useful extra information (in explicit textual format to allow easier matching) for answering questions. Moreover, our model is also comprised of dual-level attention (word/object and frame level), multi-head self/cross-integration for different sources (video and dense captions), and gates which pass more relevant information to the classifier. Finally, we also cast the frame selection problem as a multi-label classification task and introduce two loss functions, In-andOut Frame Score Margin (IOFSM) and Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy (BBCE), to better supervise the model with human importance annotations. We evaluate our model on the challenging TVQA dataset, where each of our model components provides significant gains, and our overall model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin (74.09% versus 70.52%).

However, they are inefficient in that they predict the dialogue state at every turn from scratch. Here, we consider dialogue state as an explicit fixed-sized memory and propose a selectively overwriting mechanism for more efficient DST. This mechanism consists of two steps: (1) predicting state operation on each of the memory slots, and (2) overwriting the memory with new values, of which only a few are generated according to the predicted state operations. Our method decomposes DST into two sub-tasks and guides the decoder to focus only on one of the tasks, thus reducing the burden of the decoder. This enhances the effectiveness of training and DST performance. Our SOM-DST (Selectively Overwriting Memory for Dialogue State Tracking) model achieves state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy with 51.72% in MultiWOZ 2.0 and 53.01% in MultiWOZ 2.1 in an open vocabulary-based DST setting. In addition, we analyze the accuracy gaps between the current and the ground truth-given situations and suggest that it is a promising direction to improve state operation prediction to boost the DST performance."

Our parsing model estimates the conditional probability distribution of possible splitting points in a given text span and supports efficient top-down decoding, which is linear in number of nodes. The conditional splitting formulation together with efficient beam search inference facilitate structural consistency without relying on expensive structured inference. Crucially, for discourse analysis we show that in our formulation, discourse segmentation can be framed as a special case of parsing which allows us to perform discourse parsing without requiring segmentation as a pre-requisite. Experiments show that our model achieves good results on the standard syntactic parsing tasks under settings with/without pre-trained representations and rivals state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods that are more computationally expensive than ours. In discourse parsing, our method outperforms SoTA by a good margin."

To address this question, we introduce a suite of probing tasks that enable fine-grained testing of contextual embeddings for encoding of information about surrounding words. We apply these tasks to examine the popular BERT, ELMo and GPT contextual encoders, and find that each of our tested information types is indeed encoded as contextual information across tokens, often with near-perfect recoverability-but the encoders vary in which features they distribute to which tokens, how nuanced their distributions are, and how robust the encoding of each feature is to distance. We discuss implications of these results for how different types of models breakdown and prioritize word-level context information when constructing token embeddings."

However, this research requires expensive labor costs to annotate data as the basis of research, and models that rely on fine-tuning paradigms only apply to specific tasks, rather than learn a general commonsense reasoning ability. As a more robust method, zero-shot commonsense question answering shows a good prospect. The current zero-shot framework tries to convert triples in commonsense knowledge graphs (KGs) into QA-form samples as the pre-trained data source to incorporate commonsense knowledge into the model. However, this method ignores the multi-hop relationship in the KG, which is also an important central problem in commonsense reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-hop commonsense knowledge injection framework. Specifically, it explores multi-hop reasoning paradigm in KGs that conform to linguistic logic, and we further propose two multi-hop QA generation methods based on KGs. Then, we utilize contrastive learning to pre-train the model with the synthetic QA dataset to inject multi-hop commonsense knowledge. Extensive experiments on five commonsense question answering benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-art performance."

While previous work relies heavily on bilingual lexical resources to bridge the gap between the source and the target languages, these resources are scarce or unavailable for many low-resource languages. To address this problem, we investigate zero-shot cross-lingual entity linking, in which we assume no bilingual lexical resources are available in the source low-resource language. Specifically, we propose pivot-based entity linking, which leverages information from a high-resource ""pivot"" language to train character-level neural entity linking models that are transferred to the source low-resource language in a zero-shot manner. With experiments on 9 low-resource languages and transfer through a total of 54 languages, we show that our proposed pivot-based framework improves entity linking accuracy 17% (absolute) on average over the baseline systems, for the zero-shot scenario. Further, we also investigate the use of language-universal phonological representations which improves average accuracy (absolute) by 36% when transferring between languages that use different scripts."

341,acl,2020,Overestimation of Syntactic Representation in Neural Language Models,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.160,"With the advent of powerful neural language models over the last few years, research attention has increasingly focused on what aspects of language they represent that make them so successful. Several testing methodologies have been developed to probe models' syntactic representations. One popular method for determining a model's ability to induce syntactic structure trains a model on strings generated according to a template then tests the model's ability to distinguish such strings from superficially similar ones with different syntax. We illustrate a fundamental problem with this approach by reproducing positive results from a recent paper with two non-syntactic baseline language models: an n-gram model and an LSTM model trained on scrambled inputs."
342,acl,2020,Interactive Construction of User-Centric Dictionary for Text Analytics,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.72,"We present a dictionary-based approach to racism detection in Dutch social media comments, which were retrieved from two public Belgian social media sites likely to attract racist reactions. These comments were labeled as racist or non-racist by multiple annotators. For our approach, three discourse dictionaries were created: first, we created a dictionary by retrieving possibly racist and more neutral terms from the training data, and then augmenting these with more general words to remove some bias. A second dictionary was created through automatic expansion using a \texttt{word2vec} model trained on a large corpus of general Dutch text. Finally, a third dictionary was created by manually filtering out incorrect expansions. We trained multiple Support Vector Machines, using the distribution of words over the different categories in the dictionaries as features. The best-performing model used the manually cleaned dictionary and obtained an F-score of 0.46 for the racist class on a test set consisting of unseen Dutch comments, retrieved from the same sites used for the training set. The automated expansion of the dictionary only slightly boosted the model's performance, and this increase in performance was not statistically significant. The fact that the coverage of the expanded dictionaries did increase indicates that the words that were automatically added did occur in the corpus, but were not able to meaningfully impact performance. The dictionaries, code, and the procedure for requesting the corpus are available at: https://github.com/clips/hades"
343,acl,2020,What is Learned in Visually Grounded Neural Syntax Acquisition,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.234,"Visual features are a promising signal for learning bootstrap textual models. However, blackbox learning models make it difficult to isolate the specific contribution of visual components. In this analysis, we consider the case study of the Visually Grounded Neural Syntax Learner (Shi et al., 2019), a recent approach for learning syntax from a visual training signal. By constructing simplified versions of the model, we isolate the core factors that yield the model's strong performance. Contrary to what the model might be capable of learning, we find significantly less expressive versions produce similar predictions and perform just as well, or even better. We also find that a simple lexical signal of noun concreteness plays the main role in the model's predictions as opposed to more complex syntactic reasoning."

Our work builds upon CopyAttention, a sequence generation OpenIE model (Cui et. al., 2018). Our analysis reveals that CopyAttention produces a constant number of extractions per sentence, and its extracted tuples often express redundant information.   We present IMoJIE, an extension to CopyAttention, which produces the next extraction conditioned on all previously extracted tuples. This approach overcomes both shortcomings of CopyAttention, resulting in a variable number of diverse extractions per sentence. We train IMoJIE on training data bootstrapped from extractions of several non-neural systems, which have been automatically filtered to reduce redundancy and noise. IMoJIE outperforms CopyAttention by about 18 F1 pts, and a BERT-based strong baseline by 2 F1 pts, establishing a new state of the art for the task."

SCDE is a human-created sentence cloze dataset, collected from public school English examinations. Our task requires a model to fill up multiple blanks in a passage from a shared candidate set with distractors designed by English teachers. Experimental results demonstrate that this task requires the use of non-local, discourse-level context beyond the immediate sentence neighborhood. The blanks require joint solving and significantly impair each other's context. Furthermore, through ablations, we show that the distractors are of high quality and make the task more challenging. Our experiments show that there is a significant performance gap between advanced models (72%) and humans (87%), encouraging future models to bridge this gap."
346,acl,2020,Improving Low-Resource Named Entity Recognition using Joint Sentence and Token Labeling,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.523,"Cross-lingual named entity recognition (CrossNER) faces challenges stemming from uneven performance due to the scarcity of multilingual corpora, especially for non-English data. While prior efforts mainly focus on data-driven transfer methods, a significant aspect that has not been fully explored is aligning both semantic and token-level representations across diverse languages. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Contrastive Learning for Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (mCL-NER). Specifically, we reframe the CrossNER task into a problem of recognizing relationships between pairs of tokens. This approach taps into the inherent contextual nuances of token-to-token connections within entities, allowing us to align representations across different languages. A multi-view contrastive learning framework is introduced to encompass semantic contrasts between source, codeswitched, and target sentences, as well as contrasts among token-to-token relations. By enforcing agreement within both semantic and relational spaces, we minimize the gap between source sentences and their counterparts of both codeswitched and target sentences. This alignment extends to the relationships between diverse tokens, enhancing the projection of entities across languages. We further augment CrossNER by combining self-training with labeled source data and unlabeled target data. Our experiments on the XTREME benchmark, spanning 40 languages, demonstrate the superiority of mCL-NER over prior data-driven and model-based approaches. It achieves a substantial increase of nearly +2.0 $F_1$ scores across a broad spectrum and establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art performer."

Scientific publications provide valuable information into cutting-edge scientific advances, but efficient processing of increasing amounts of data is a time-consuming task. In this paper, several modifications of methods for the Russian language are proposed. It also includes the results of experiments comparing a keyword extraction method, vocabulary method, and some methods based on neural networks. Text collections for these tasks exist for the English language and are actively used by the scientific community, but at present, such datasets in Russian are not publicly available. In this paper, we present a corpus of scientific texts in Russian, RuSERRC. This dataset consists of 1600 unlabeled documents and 80 labeled with entities and semantic relations (6 relation types were considered). The dataset and models are available at https://github.com/iis-research-team. We hope they can be useful for research purposes and development of information extraction systems."

However, such studies often suffer from limited scope by focusing on a single language and a single linguistic formalism. In this study, we aim to investigate the extent to which the semblance of syntactic structure captured by language models adheres to a surface-syntactic or deep syntactic style of analysis, and whether the patterns are consistent across different languages. We apply a probe for extracting directed dependency trees to BERT and ELMo models trained on 13 different languages, probing for two different syntactic annotation styles: Universal Dependencies (UD), prioritizing deep syntactic relations, and Surface-Syntactic Universal Dependencies (SUD), focusing on surface structure. We find that both models exhibit a preference for UD over SUD - with interesting variations across languages and layers - and that the strength of this preference is correlated with differences in tree shape."

However, limitations of existing datasets hinder the development of large-scale models capable of generating and utilising clarification questions. In order to overcome these limitations, we devise a novel bootstrapping framework (based on self-supervision) that assists in the creation of a diverse, large-scale dataset of clarification questions based on post-comment tuples extracted from stackexchange. The framework utilises a neural network based architecture for classifying clarification questions. It is a two-step method where the first aims to increase the precision of the classifier and second aims to increase its recall. We quantitatively demonstrate the utility of the newly created dataset by applying it to the downstream task of question-answering. The final dataset, ClarQ, consists of ~2M examples distributed across 173 domains of stackexchange. We release this dataset in order to foster research into the field of clarification question generation with the larger goal of enhancing dialog and question answering systems."

Our model is guided by a scoring function involving fluency, simplicity, and meaning preservation. Then, we iteratively perform word and phrase-level edits on the complex sentence. Compared with previous approaches, our model does not require a parallel training set, but is more controllable and interpretable. Experiments on Newsela and WikiLarge datasets show that our approach is nearly as effective as state-of-the-art supervised approaches."
351,acl,2020,An Online Semantic-enhanced Dirichlet Model for Short Text Stream Clustering,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.70,"Analyzing texts from social media encounters many challenges due to their unique characteristics of shortness, massiveness, and dynamic. Short texts do not provide enough context information, causing the failure of the traditional statistical models. Furthermore, many applications often face with massive and dynamic short texts, causing various computational challenges to the current batch learning algorithms. This paper presents a novel framework, namely Bag of Biterms Modeling (BBM), for modeling massive, dynamic, and short text collections. BBM comprises of two main ingredients: (1) the concept of Bag of Biterms (BoB) for representing documents, and (2) a simple way to help statistical models to include BoB. Our framework can be easily deployed for a large class of probabilistic models, and we demonstrate its usefulness with two well-known models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). By exploiting both terms (words) and biterms (pairs of words), the major advantages of BBM are: (1) it enhances the length of the documents and makes the context more coherent by emphasizing the word connotation and co-occurrence via Bag of Biterms, (2) it inherits inference and learning algorithms from the primitive to make it straightforward to design online and streaming algorithms for short texts. Extensive experiments suggest that BBM outperforms several state-of-the-art models. We also point out that the BoB representation performs better than the traditional representations (e.g, Bag of Words, tf-idf) even for normal texts."
352,acl,2020,NILE : Natural Language Inference with Faithful Natural Language Explanations,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.771,"The recent growth in the popularity and success of deep learning models on NLP classification tasks has accompanied the need for generating some form of natural language explanation of the predicted labels. Such generated natural language (NL) explanations are expected to be faithful, i.e., they should correlate well with the model's internal decision making. In this work, we focus on the task of natural language inference (NLI) and address the following question: can we build NLI systems which produce labels with high accuracy, while also generating faithful explanations of its decisions? We propose Natural-language Inference over Label-specific Explanations (NILE), a novel NLI method which utilizes auto-generated label-specific NL explanations to produce labels along with its faithful explanation. We demonstrate NILE's effectiveness over previously reported methods through automated and human evaluation of the produced labels and explanations. Our evaluation of NILE also supports the claim that accurate systems capable of providing testable explanations of their decisions can be designed. We discuss the faithfulness of NILE's explanations in terms of sensitivity of the decisions to the corresponding explanations. We argue that explicit evaluation of faithfulness, in addition to label and explanation accuracy, is an important step in evaluating model's explanations. Further, we demonstrate that task-specific probes are necessary to establish such sensitivity."
353,acl,2020,Learning to Identify Follow-Up Questions in Conversational Question Answering,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.90,"We investigate the problem of generating informative questions in information-asymmetric conversations. Unlike previous work on question generation which largely assumes knowledge of what the answer might be, we are interested in the scenario where the questioner is not given the context from which answers are drawn, but must reason pragmatically about how to acquire new information, given the shared conversation history. We identify two core challenges: (1) formally defining the informativeness of potential questions, and (2) exploring the prohibitively large space of potential questions to find the good candidates. To generate pragmatic questions, we use reinforcement learning to optimize an informativeness metric we propose, combined with a reward function designed to promote more specific questions. We demonstrate that the resulting pragmatic questioner substantially improves the informativeness and specificity of questions generated over a baseline model, as evaluated by our metrics as well as humans."
354,acl,2020,Language Models as an Alternative Evaluator of Word Order Hypotheses: A Case Study in Japanese,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.47,"We examine a methodology using neural language models (LMs) for analyzing the word order of language. This LM-based method has the potential to overcome the difficulties existing methods face, such as the propagation of preprocessor errors in count-based methods. In this study, we explore whether the LM-based method is valid for analyzing the word order. As a case study, this study focuses on Japanese due to its complex and flexible word order. To validate the LM-based method, we test (i) parallels between LMs and human word order preference, and (ii) consistency of the results obtained using the LM-based method with previous linguistic studies. Through our experiments, we tentatively conclude that LMs display sufficient word order knowledge for usage as an analysis tool. Finally, using the LM-based method, we demonstrate the relationship between the canonical word order and topicalization, which had yet to be analyzed by large-scale experiments."
355,acl,2020,Weight Poisoning Attacks on Pretrained Models,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.249,"With the development of deep learning (DL), DL-based code search models have achieved state-of-the-art performance and have been widely used by developers during software development. However, the security issue, e.g., recommending vulnerable code, has not received sufficient attention, which will bring potential harm to software development. Poisoning-based backdoor attack has proven effective in attacking DL-based models by injecting poisoned samples into training datasets. However, previous work shows that the attack technique does not perform successfully on all DL-based code search models and tends to fail for Transformer-based models, especially pretrained models. Besides, the infected models generally perform worse than benign models, which makes the attack not stealthy enough and thereby hinders the adoption by developers. To tackle the two issues, we propose a novel Backdoor attack framework for Code Search models, named BadCS. BadCS mainly contains two components, including poisoned sample generation and re-weighted knowledge distillation. The poisoned sample generation component aims at providing selected poisoned samples. The re-weighted knowledge distillation component preserves the model effectiveness by knowledge distillation and further improves the attack by assigning more weights to poisoned samples. Experiments on four popular DL-based models and two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the existing code search systems are easily attacked by BadCS. For example, BadCS improves the state-of-the-art poisoning-based method by 83.03%-99.98% and 75.98%-99.90% on Python and Java datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, BadCS also achieves a relatively better performance than benign models, increasing the baseline models by 0.49% and 0.46% on average, respectively."

To take advantage of text-only data, language model (LM) integration approaches such as rescoring and shallow fusion have been widely used for CTC. However, they lose CTC's non-autoregressive nature because of the need for beam search, which slows down the inference speed. In this study, we propose an error correction method with phone-conditioned masked LM (PC-MLM). In the proposed method, less confident word tokens in a greedy decoded output from CTC are masked. PC-MLM then predicts these masked word tokens given unmasked words and phones supplementally predicted from CTC. We further extend it to Deletable PC-MLM in order to address insertion errors. Since both CTC and PC-MLM are non-autoregressive models, the method enables fast LM integration. Experimental evaluations on the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) and TED-LIUM2 in domain adaptation setting shows that our proposed method outperformed rescoring and shallow fusion in terms of inference speed, and also in terms of recognition accuracy on CSJ."

In this study, we propose a novel method that replicates the effects of a model ensemble with a single model.

We propose a novel unsupervised method to derive multilingual sentence embeddings relying only on monolingual data. We first produce a synthetic parallel corpus using unsupervised machine translation, and use it to fine-tune a pretrained cross-lingual masked language model (XLM) to derive the multilingual sentence representations. The quality of the representations is evaluated on two parallel corpus mining tasks with improvements of up to 22 F1 points over vanilla XLM. In addition, we observe that a single synthetic bilingual corpus is able to improve results for other language pairs."

The increasing need to approximate conversational interaction styles raises expectations for chatbots to present social behaviors that are habitual in human-human communication. In this survey, we argue that chatbots should be enriched with social characteristics that cohere with users' expectations, ultimately avoiding frustration and dissatisfaction. We bring together the literature on disembodied, text-based chatbots to derive a conceptual model of social characteristics for chatbots. We analyzed 56 papers from various domains to understand how social characteristics can benefit human-chatbot interactions and identify the challenges and strategies to designing them. Additionally, we discussed how characteristics may influence one another. Our results provide relevant opportunities to both researchers and designers to advance human-chatbot interactions."

It introduces a novel method that encourages the inclusion of key terms from the original document into the summary: key terms are masked out of the original document and must be filled in by a coverage model using the current generated summary. A novel unsupervised training procedure leverages this coverage model along with a fluency model to generate and score summaries. When tested on popular news summarization datasets, the method outperforms previous unsupervised methods by more than 2 R-1 points, and approaches results of competitive supervised methods. Our model attains higher levels of abstraction with copied passages roughly two times shorter than prior work, and learns to compress and merge sentences without supervision."

This is a harder task than the news summarization task, given the chapter length as well as the extreme paraphrasing and generalization found in the summaries. We focus on extractive summarization, which requires the creation of a gold-standard set of extractive summaries. We present a new metric for aligning reference summary sentences with chapter sentences to create gold extracts and also experiment with different alignment methods.

Its performance is largely influenced by the annotation quality and quantity in supervised learning scenarios, and obtaining ground truth labels is often costly. In many cases, ground truth labels do not exist, but noisy annotations or annotations from different domains are accessible. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Consensus Network (ConNet) that can be trained on annotations from multiple sources (e.g., crowd annotation, cross-domain data...). It learns individual representation for every source and dynamically aggregates source-specific knowledge by a context-aware attention module. Finally, it leads to a model reflecting the agreement (consensus) among multiple sources. We evaluate the proposed framework in two practical settings of multi-source learning: learning with crowd annotations and unsupervised cross-domain model adaptation. Extensive experimental results show that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods in both settings. We also demonstrate that the method can apply to various tasks and cope with different encoders."

In general, a question can be correctly answered if its query graph is built correctly and the right answer is then retrieved by issuing the query graph against the KG. Therefore, this paper focuses on query graph generation from natural language questions. Existing approaches for query graph generation ignore the semantic structure of a question, resulting in a large number of noisy query graph candidates that undermine prediction accuracies. In this paper, we define six semantic structures from common questions in KGQA and develop a novel Structure-BERT to predict the semantic structure of a question. By doing so, we can first filter out noisy candidate query graphs, and then rank the remaining candidates with a BERT-based ranking model. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks MetaQA and WebQuestionsSP (WSP) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as compared to state-of-the-arts."

This complexity, together with a general scarcity of written data, poses a challenge to the development of natural language technologies. To address this challenge, we offer linguistically-informed approaches for bootstrapping a neural morphological analyzer, and demonstrate its application to Kunwinjku, a polysynthetic Australian language. We generate data from a finite state transducer to train an encoder-decoder model. We improve the model by ""hallucinating"" missing linguistic structure into the training data, and by resampling from a Zipf distribution to simulate a more natural distribution of morphemes. The best model accounts for all instances of reduplication in the test set and achieves an accuracy of 94.7% overall, a 10 percentage point improvement over the FST baseline. This process demonstrates the feasibility of bootstrapping a neural morph analyzer from minimal resources."

Our starting point is a language model that has been trained on generic, not task-specific language data. We then place this model in a multi-agent self-play environment that generates task-specific rewards used to adapt or modulate the model, turning it into a task-conditional language model. We introduce a new way for combining the two types of learning based on the idea of reranking language model samples, and show that this method outperforms others in communicating with humans in a visual referential communication task.

Unlike chit-chat dialogue models, task-oriented dialogue models fulfill at least two task-specific modules: dialogue state tracker (DST) and response generator (RG). The dialogue state consists of the domain-slot-value triples, which are regarded as the user's constraints to search the domain-related databases. The large-scale task-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state usually are inaccessible. It prevents the development of the pretrained language model for the task-oriented dialogue. We propose a simple yet effective pretraining method to alleviate this problem, which consists of two pretraining phases. The first phase is to pretrain on large-scale contextual text data, where the structured information of the text is extracted by the information extracting tool. To bridge the gap between the pretraining method and downstream tasks, we design two pretraining tasks: ontology-like triple recovery and next-text generation, which simulates the DST and RG, respectively. The second phase is to fine-tune the pretrained model on the TOD data. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an exciting boost and get competitive performance even without any TOD data on CamRest676 and MultiWOZ benchmarks."

Such a simple task for humans has remained challenging for modern abstractive summarizers, substantially restricting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present an investigation into fusing sentences drawn from a document by introducing the notion of points of correspondence, which are cohesive devices that tie any two sentences together into a coherent text. The types of points of correspondence are delineated by text cohesion theory, covering pronominal and nominal referencing, repetition and beyond. We create a dataset containing the documents, source and fusion sentences, and human annotations of points of correspondence between sentences. Our dataset bridges the gap between coreference resolution and summarization. It is publicly shared to serve as a basis for future work to measure the success of sentence fusion systems.

To mitigate this cost, machine learning methods, such as transfer learning, semi-supervised learning and active learning, aim to be label-efficient: achieving high predictive performance from relatively few labeled examples. While obtaining the best label-efficiency in practice often requires combinations of these techniques, existing benchmark and evaluation frameworks do not capture a concerted combination of all such techniques. This paper addresses this deficiency by introducing LabelBench, a new computationally-efficient framework for joint evaluation of multiple label-efficient learning techniques. As an application of LabelBench, we introduce a novel benchmark of state-of-the-art active learning methods in combination with semi-supervised learning for fine-tuning pretrained vision transformers. Our benchmark demonstrates better label-efficiencies than previously reported in active learning. LabelBench's modular codebase is open-sourced for the broader community to contribute label-efficient learning methods and benchmarks.

Our model uses a Seq2Seq model in combination with pointer networks to align and choose words from the monolingual sentences and form a grammatical code-switching sentence. In our experiment, we show that by training a language model using the augmented sentences we improve the perplexity score by 10% compared to the LSTM baseline."
372,acl,2020,Generating Diverse and Consistent QA pairs from Contexts with Information-Maximizing Hierarchical Conditional VAEs,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.20,"One of the most crucial challenges in question answering (QA) is the scarcity of labeled data, since it is costly to obtain question-answer (QA) pairs for a target text domain with human annotation. An alternative approach to tackle the problem is to use automatically generated QA pairs from either the problem context or from large amount of unstructured texts (e.g. Wikipedia). In this work, we propose a hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (HCVAE) for generating QA pairs given unstructured texts as contexts, while maximizing the mutual information between generated QA pairs to ensure their consistency. We validate our Information Maximizing Hierarchical Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (Info-HCVAE) on several benchmark datasets by evaluating the performance of the QA model (BERT-base) using only the generated QA pairs (QA-based evaluation) or by using both the generated and human-labeled pairs (semi-supervised learning) for training, against state-of-the-art baseline models. The results show that our model obtains impressive performance gains over all baselines on both tasks, using only a fraction of data for training."
373,acl,2020,Empowering Active Learning to Jointly Optimize System and User Demands,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.390,"Existing approaches to active learning maximize the system performance by sampling unlabeled instances for annotation that yield the most efficient training. However, when active learning is integrated with an end-user application, this can lead to frustration for participating users, as they spend time labeling instances that they would not otherwise be interested in reading. In this paper, we propose a new active learning approach that jointly optimizes the seemingly counteracting objectives of the active learning system (training efficiently) and the user (receiving useful instances). We study our approach in an educational application, which particularly benefits from this technique as the system needs to rapidly learn to predict the appropriateness of an exercise to a particular user, while the users should receive only exercises that match their skills. We evaluate multiple learning strategies and user types with data from real users and find that our joint approach better satisfies both objectives when alternative methods lead to many unsuitable exercises for end users."

In this paper, we aim to improve the quality of each phrase embedding by augmenting it with a contextualized sparse representation (Sparc). Unlike previous sparse vectors that are term-frequency-based (e.g., tf-idf) or directly learned (only few thousand dimensions), we leverage rectified self-attention to indirectly learn sparse vectors in n-gram vocabulary space. By augmenting the previous phrase retrieval model (Seo et al., 2019) with Sparc, we show 4%+ improvement in CuratedTREC and SQuAD-Open. Our CuratedTREC score is even better than the best known retrieve & read model with at least 45x faster inference speed."

Towards this goal, we propose a new approach called Memory-Augmented Recurrent Transformer (MART), which uses a memory module to augment the transformer architecture. The memory module generates a highly summarized memory state from the video segments and the sentence history so as to help better prediction of the next sentence (w.r.t. coreference and repetition aspects), thus encouraging coherent paragraph generation. Extensive experiments, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses on two popular datasets ActivityNet Captions and YouCookII show that MART generates more coherent and less repetitive paragraph captions than baseline methods, while maintaining relevance to the input video events.

376,acl,2020,TVQA+: Spatio-Temporal Grounding for Video Question Answering,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.730,"Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is the task of answering the natural language questions about a video. Producing an answer requires understanding the interplay across visual scenes in video and linguistic semantics in question. However, most leading VideoQA models work as black boxes, which make the visual-linguistic alignment behind the answering process obscure. Such black-box nature calls for visual explainability that reveals ``What part of the video should the model look at to answer the question?''. Only a few works present the visual explanations in a post-hoc fashion, which emulates the target model's answering process via an additional method. Nonetheless, the emulation struggles to faithfully exhibit the visual-linguistic alignment during answering.   Instead of post-hoc explainability, we focus on intrinsic interpretability to make the answering process transparent. At its core is grounding the question-critical cues as the causal scene to yield answers, while rolling out the question-irrelevant information as the environment scene. Taking a causal look at VideoQA, we devise a self-interpretable framework, Equivariant and Invariant Grounding for Interpretable VideoQA (EIGV). Specifically, the equivariant grounding encourages the answering to be sensitive to the semantic changes in the causal scene and question; in contrast, the invariant grounding enforces the answering to be insensitive to the changes in the environment scene. By imposing them on the answering process, EIGV is able to distinguish the causal scene from the environment information, and explicitly present the visual-linguistic alignment. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets justify the superiority of EIGV in terms of accuracy and visual interpretability over the leading baselines."

From empirical analysis and previous research, we find three psychological traits most dominant in Phishing emails - A Sense of Urgency, Inducing Fear by Threatening, and Enticement with Desire. We manually label 10% of all phishing emails in our training dataset for these three traits. We leverage that knowledge by training BERT, Sentence-BERT (SBERT), and Character-level-CNN models and capturing the nuances via the last layers that form the Phishing Psychological Trait (PPT) scores. For the phishing email detection task, we use the pretrained BERT and SBERT model, and concatenate the PPT scores to feed into a fully-connected neural network model. Our results show that the addition of PPT scores improves the model performance significantly, thus indicating the effectiveness of PPT scores in capturing the psychological nuances. Furthermore, to mitigate the effect of the imbalanced training dataset, we use the GPT-2 model to generate phishing emails (Radford et al., 2019). Our best model outperforms the current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) model's F1 score by 4.54%. Additionally, our analysis of individual PPTs suggests that Fear provides the strongest cue in detecting phishing emails."

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of generative pre-training in computer programs, yet they are always English-centric. In this work, we step towards bridging the gap between multilingual NLs and multilingual PLs for large language models (LLMs). We release ERNIE-Code, a unified pre-trained language model for 116 NLs and 6 PLs. We employ two methods for universal cross-lingual pre-training: span-corruption language modeling that learns patterns from monolingual NL or PL; and pivot-based translation language modeling that relies on parallel data of many NLs and PLs. Extensive results show that ERNIE-Code outperforms previous multilingual LLMs for PL or NL across a wide range of end tasks of code intelligence, including multilingual code-to-text, text-to-code, code-to-code, and text-to-text generation. We further show its advantage of zero-shot prompting on multilingual code summarization and text-to-text translation. We release our code and pre-trained checkpoints."

Definition modeling aims to make the semantic content in each embedding explicit, by outputting a natural language definition based on the embedding. However, existing definition models are limited in their ability to generate accurate definitions for different senses of the same word. In this paper, we introduce a new method that enables definition modeling for multiple senses. We show how a Gumble-Softmax approach outperforms baselines at matching sense-specific embeddings to definitions during training. In experiments, our multi-sense definition model improves recall over a state-of-the-art single-sense definition model by a factor of three, without harming precision."

First, three language modeling tasks are used to pre-train the transformers, token- and utterance-level language modeling and utterance order prediction, that learn both token and utterance embeddings for better understanding in dialogue contexts. Then, multi-task learning between the utterance prediction and the token span prediction is applied to fine-tune for span-based question answering (QA).

We introduce strong baselines for them, by training an existing supervised parsing model (Kitaev and Klein, 2018) on the same labeled examples they access. When training on the 1,700 examples, or even when using only 50 examples for training and 5 for development, such a few-shot parsing approach can outperform all the unsupervised parsing methods by a significant margin. Few-shot parsing can be further improved by a simple data augmentation method and self-training. This suggests that, in order to arrive at fair conclusions, we should carefully consider the amount of labeled data used for model development. We propose two protocols for future work on unsupervised parsing: (i) use fully unsupervised criteria for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; (ii) use as few labeled examples as possible for model development, and compare to few-shot parsing trained on the same labeled examples."

One of the big challenges with this task is the lack of sufficient annotated data. While data augmentation is potentially an effective technique to address the above issue, it is uncontrollable as it may change aspect words and aspect labels unexpectedly. In this paper, we formulate the data augmentation as a conditional generation task: generating a new sentence while preserving the original opinion targets and labels. We propose a masked sequence-to-sequence method for conditional augmentation of aspect term extraction. Unlike existing augmentation approaches, ours is controllable and allows us to generate more diversified sentences. Experimental results confirm that our method alleviates the data scarcity problem significantly. It also effectively boosts the performances of several current models for aspect term extraction."
386,acl,2020,A Unified MRC Framework for Named Entity Recognition,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.519,"NER has been traditionally formulated as a sequence labeling task. However, there has been recent trend in posing NER as a machine reading comprehension task (Wang et al., 2020; Mengge et al., 2020), where entity name (or other information) is considered as a question, text as the context and entity value in text as answer snippet. These works consider MRC based on a single question (entity) at a time. We propose posing NER as a multi-question MRC task, where multiple questions (one question per entity) are considered at the same time for a single text. We propose a novel BERT-based multi-question MRC (NER-MQMRC) architecture for this formulation. NER-MQMRC architecture considers all entities as input to BERT for learning token embeddings with self-attention and leverages BERT-based entity representation for further improving these token embeddings for NER task. Evaluation on three NER datasets show that our proposed architecture leads to average 2.5 times faster training and 2.3 times faster inference as compared to NER-SQMRC framework based models by considering all entities together in a single pass. Further, we show that our model performance does not degrade compared to single-question based MRC (NER-SQMRC) (Devlin et al., 2019) leading to F1 gain of +0.41%, +0.32% and +0.27% for AE-Pub, Ecommerce5PT and Twitter datasets respectively.

For a better search result, we design a joint learning method to perform intra-cell and inter-cell NAS simultaneously. We implement our model in a differentiable architecture search system. For recurrent neural language modeling, it outperforms a strong baseline significantly on the PTB and WikiText data, with a new state-of-the-art on PTB. Moreover, the learned architectures show good transferability to other systems. E.g., they improve state-of-the-art systems on the CoNLL and WNUT named entity recognition (NER) tasks and CoNLL chunking task, indicating a promising line of research on large-scale pre-learned architectures."

To scale training, we decouple the language and action data by (a) annotating action phrase spans in HowTo instructions and (b) synthesizing grounded descriptions of actions for mobile user interfaces. We use a Transformer to extract action phrase tuples from long-range natural language instructions. A grounding Transformer then contextually represents UI objects using both their content and screen position and connects them to object descriptions. Given a starting screen and instruction, our model achieves 70.59% accuracy on predicting complete ground-truth action sequences in PIXELHELP."

Prior work deals with these two tasks independently, which ignores the semantic connection between the two tasks. In this paper, we propose to use the machine reading comprehension (MRC) framework to bridge this gap. We formalize predicate disambiguation as multiple-choice machine reading comprehension, where the descriptions of candidate senses of a given predicate are used as options to select the correct sense. The chosen predicate sense is then used to determine the semantic roles for that predicate, and these semantic roles are used to construct the query for another MRC model for argument labeling. In this way, we are able to leverage both the predicate semantics and the semantic role semantics for argument labeling. We also propose to select a subset of all the possible semantic roles for computational efficiency. Experiments show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results to previous work. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ShannonAI/MRC-SRL}."

We evaluate our technique in the Frogger game environment, training an autonomous game playing agent to rationalize its action choices using natural language. A natural language training corpus is collected from human players thinking out loud as they play the game. We motivate the use of rationalization as an approach to explanation generation and show the results of two experiments evaluating the effectiveness of rationalization. Results of these evaluations show that neural machine translation is able to accurately generate rationalizations that describe agent behavior, and that rationalizations are more satisfying to humans than other alternative methods of explanation."

In addition, to further reduce the bias problem in the gate mechanism, this paper proposes a regularization method to guide the learning of the gates with supervision automatically generated using pointwise mutual information. Extensive experiments on 4 translation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model obtains an averaged gain of 1.0 BLEU score over a strong Transformer baseline."

This paper proposes a solution to the second problem, a system we call Helpa. End-users can teach Helpa arbitrary new tasks whose level of complexity is similar to the tasks available from today's most popular virtual assistants. Teaching Helpa does not involve any programming. Instead, users teach Helpa by providing just one example of a command paired with a demonstration of how to execute that command. Helpa does not rely on any pre-existing domain-specific knowledge. It is therefore completely domain-independent. Our usability study showed that end-users can teach Helpa many new tasks in less than a minute each, often much less."

In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved significant success in named entity recognition and many other Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Most of these algorithms are trained end to end, and can automatically learn features from large scale labeled datasets. However, these data-driven methods typically lack the capability of processing rare or unseen entities. Previous statistical methods and feature engineering practice have demonstrated that human knowledge can provide valuable information for handling rare and unseen cases. In this paper, we address the problem by incorporating dictionaries into deep neural networks for the Chinese CNER task. Two different architectures that extend the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network and five different feature representation schemes are proposed to handle the task. Computational results on the CCKS-2017 Task 2 benchmark dataset show that the proposed method achieves the highly competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning methods."

We collect 64,000 examples by prompting a language model with three seed examples of instructions and eliciting a fourth. This set is then expanded by prompting the model to rephrase each instruction, creating a total of approximately 240,000 examples of instructions, inputs, and outputs. Experiments show that despite containing a fair amount of noise, training on Unnatural Instructions rivals the effectiveness of training on open-source manually-curated datasets, surpassing the performance of models such as T0++ and Tk-Instruct across various benchmarks. These results demonstrate the potential of model-generated data as a cost-effective alternative to crowdsourcing for dataset expansion and diversification."

However, without considering the penalization of problematic tokens, LMs trained using cross-entropy exhibit text degeneration. To address this, unlikelihood training has been proposed to reduce the probability of unlikely tokens predicted by LMs. But unlikelihood does not consider the relationship between the label tokens and unlikely token candidates, thus showing marginal improvements in degeneration. We propose a new contrastive token learning objective that inherits the advantages of cross-entropy and unlikelihood training and avoids their limitations. The key idea is to teach a LM to generate high probabilities for label tokens and low probabilities of negative candidates. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling and open-domain dialogue generation tasks show that the proposed contrastive token objective yields much less repetitive texts, with a higher generation quality than baseline approaches, achieving the new state-of-the-art performance on text degeneration."

The most commonly used cross entropy (CE) criteria is actually an accuracy-oriented objective, and thus creates a discrepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance contributes equally to the objective function, while at test time F1 score concerns more about positive examples. In this paper, we propose to use dice loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data-imbalanced NLP tasks. Dice loss is based on the Sorensen-Dice coefficient or Tversky index, which attaches similar importance to false positives and false negatives, and is more immune to the data-imbalance issue. To further alleviate the dominating influence from easy-negative examples in training, we propose to associate training examples with dynamically adjusted weights to deemphasize easy-negative examples.Theoretical analysis shows that this strategy narrows down the gap between the F1 score in evaluation and the dice loss in training. With the proposed training objective, we observe significant performance boost on a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks. Notably, we are able to achieve SOTA results on CTB5, CTB6 and UD1.4 for the part of speech tagging task; SOTA results on CoNLL03, OntoNotes5.0, MSRA and OntoNotes4.0 for the named entity recognition task; along with competitive results on the tasks of machine reading comprehension and paraphrase identification."

Second, we take advantage of the QA model to extract more appropriate answers, which iteratively refines data over RefQA. We conduct experiments on SQuAD 1.1, and NewsQA by fine-tuning BERT without access to manually annotated data.

We hypothesize that explicit discourse representations have utility for NLP tasks over longer documents or document sequences, which sequence-to-sequence models are unable to capture. For abstractive summarization, for instance, conventional neural models simply match source documents and the summary in a latent space without explicit representation of text structure or relations. In this paper, we propose to use neural discourse representations obtained from a rhetorical structure theory (RST) parser to enhance document representations. Specifically, document representations are generated for discourse spans, known as the elementary discourse units (EDUs). We empirically investigate the benefit of the proposed approach on two different tasks: abstractive summarization and popularity prediction of online petitions.

Our model utilizes graphs to encode documents in order to capture cross-document relations, which is crucial to summarizing long documents. Our model can also take advantage of graphs to guide the summary generation process, which is beneficial for generating coherent and concise summaries. Furthermore, pre-trained language models can be easily combined with our model, which further improve the summarization performance significantly.

Meta-NLG defines a set of meta tasks, and directly incorporates the objective of adapting to new low-resource NLG tasks into the meta-learning optimization process. Extensive experiments are conducted on a large multi-domain dataset (MultiWoz) with diverse linguistic variations. We show that Meta-NLG significantly outperforms other training procedures in various low-resource configurations. We analyze the results, and demonstrate that Meta-NLG adapts extremely fast and well to low-resource situations."

Proper nouns, such as a person's name, an organization's name, or a location's name, are examples of entities. The NER is one of the important modules in applications like human resources, customer support, search engines, content classification, and academia. In this work, we consider NER for low-resource Indian languages like Hindi and Marathi. The transformer-based models have been widely used for NER tasks. We consider different variations of BERT like base-BERT, RoBERTa, and AlBERT and benchmark them on publicly available Hindi and Marathi NER datasets. We provide an exhaustive comparison of different monolingual and multilingual transformer-based models and establish simple baselines currently missing in the literature. We show that the monolingual MahaRoBERTa model performs the best for Marathi NER whereas the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa performs the best for Hindi NER. We also perform cross-language evaluation and present mixed observations."
405,acl,2020,Enhancing Pre-trained Chinese Character Representation with Word-aligned Attention,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.315,"Chinese characters carry a wealth of morphological and semantic information; therefore, the semantic enhancement of the morphology of Chinese characters has drawn significant attention. The previous methods were intended to directly extract information from a whole Chinese character image, which usually cannot capture both global and local information simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a stroke-based autoencoder(SAE), to model the sophisticated morphology of Chinese characters with the self-supervised method. Following its canonical writing order, we first represent a Chinese character as a series of stroke images with a fixed writing order, and then our SAE model is trained to reconstruct this stroke image sequence. This pre-trained SAE model can predict the stroke image series for unseen characters, as long as their strokes or radicals appeared in the training set. We have designed two contrasting SAE architectures on different forms of stroke images. One is fine-tuned on existing stroke-based method for zero-shot recognition of handwritten Chinese characters, and the other is applied to enrich the Chinese word embeddings from their morphological features. The experimental results validate that after pre-training, our SAE architecture outperforms other existing methods in zero-shot recognition and enhances the representation of Chinese characters with their abundant morphological and semantic information."
406,acl,2020,What Does BERT with Vision Look At?,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.469,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a high-energy phosphate compound and the most direct energy source in organisms. ATP is an essential biomarker for evaluating cell viability in biology. Researchers often use ATP bioluminescence to measure the ATP of organoid after drug to evaluate the drug efficacy. However, ATP bioluminescence has some limitations, leading to unreliable drug screening results. Performing ATP bioluminescence causes cell lysis of organoids, so it is impossible to observe organoids' long-term viability changes after medication continually. To overcome the disadvantages of ATP bioluminescence, we propose Ins-ATP, a non-invasive strategy, the first organoid ATP estimation model based on the high-throughput microscopic image. Ins-ATP directly estimates the ATP of organoids from high-throughput microscopic images, so that it does not influence the drug reactions of organoids. Therefore, the ATP change of organoids can be observed for a long time to obtain more stable results. Experimental results show that the ATP estimation by Ins-ATP is in good agreement with those determined by ATP bioluminescence. Specifically, the predictions of Ins-ATP are consistent with the results measured by ATP bioluminescence in the efficacy evaluation experiments of different drugs."

However, the state of the art techniques to process, mining and manage those rich media are still in their infancy. Advances developments in multimedia acquisition and storage technology the rapid progress has led to the fast growing incredible amount of data stored in databases. Useful information to users can be revealed if these multimedia files are analyzed. Multimedia mining deals with the extraction of implicit knowledge, multimedia data relationships, or other patterns not explicitly stored in multimedia files. Also in retrieval, indexing and classification of multimedia data with efficient information fusion of the different modalities is essential for the system's overall performance. The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic overview of multimedia mining.

408,acl,2020,Rigid Formats Controlled Text Generation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.68,"Neural text generation has made tremendous progress in various tasks. One common characteristic of most of the tasks is that the texts are not restricted to some rigid formats when generating. However, we may confront some special text paradigms such as Lyrics (assume the music score is given), Sonnet, SongCi (classical Chinese poetry of the Song dynasty), etc. The typical characteristics of these texts are in three folds: (1) They must comply fully with the rigid predefined formats. (2) They must obey some rhyming schemes. (3) Although they are restricted to some formats, the sentence integrity must be guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, text generation based on the predefined rigid formats has not been well investigated. Therefore, we propose a simple and elegant framework named SongNet to tackle this problem. The backbone of the framework is a Transformer-based auto-regressive language model. Sets of symbols are tailor-designed to improve the modeling performance especially on format, rhyme, and sentence integrity. We improve the attention mechanism to impel the model to capture some future information on the format. A pre-training and fine-tuning framework is designed to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments conducted on two collected corpora demonstrate that our proposed framework generates significantly better results in terms of both automatic metrics and the human evaluation."

We develop the first benchmark and collect a dataset of 245 multimedia news articles with extensively annotated events and arguments. We propose a novel method, Weakly Aligned Structured Embedding (WASE), that encodes structured representations of semantic information from textual and visual data into a common embedding space. The structures are aligned across modalities by employing a weakly supervised training strategy, which enables exploiting available resources without explicit cross-media annotation. Compared to uni-modal state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves 4.0% and 9.8% absolute F-score gains on text event argument role labeling and visual event extraction. Compared to state-of-the-art multimedia unstructured representations, we achieve 8.3% and 5.0% absolute F-score gains on multimedia event extraction and argument role labeling, respectively. By utilizing images, we extract 21.4% more event mentions than traditional text-only methods."
410,acl,2020,Towards Debiasing Sentence Representations,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.488,"As natural language processing methods are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it becomes necessary to recognize the role they potentially play in shaping social biases and stereotypes. Previous work has revealed the presence of social biases in widely used word embeddings involving gender, race, religion, and other social constructs. While some methods were proposed to debias these word-level embeddings, there is a need to perform debiasing at the sentence-level given the recent shift towards new contextualized sentence representations such as ELMo and BERT. In this paper, we investigate the presence of social biases in sentence-level representations and propose a new method, Sent-Debias, to reduce these biases. We show that Sent-Debias is effective in removing biases, and at the same time, preserves performance on sentence-level downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, linguistic acceptability, and natural language understanding. We hope that our work will inspire future research on characterizing and removing social biases from widely adopted sentence representations for fairer NLP."

Existing automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEU are mostly reference-based. They calculate the difference between the generated response and a limited number of available references. Likert-score based self-reported user rating is widely adopted by social conversational systems, such as Amazon Alexa Prize chatbots. However, self-reported user rating suffers from bias and variance among different users. To alleviate this problem, we formulate dialog evaluation as a comparison task. We also propose an automatic evaluation model CMADE (Comparison Model for Automatic Dialog Evaluation) that automatically cleans self-reported user ratings as it trains on them. Specifically, we first use a self-supervised method to learn better dialog feature representation, and then use KNN and Shapley to remove confusing samples. Our experiments show that CMADE achieves 89.2% accuracy in the dialog comparison task."

While pretrained masked language models such as BERT overwhelm the line of natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, autoregressive language models such as GPT are especially capable in natural language generation (NLG). In this paper, we propose a probabilistic masking scheme for the masked language model, which we call probabilistically masked language model (PMLM). We implement a specific PMLM with a uniform prior distribution on the masking ratio named u-PMLM. We prove that u-PMLM is equivalent to an autoregressive permutated language model. One main advantage of the model is that it supports text generation in arbitrary order with surprisingly good quality, which could potentially enable new applications over traditional unidirectional generation. Besides, the pretrained u-PMLM also outperforms BERT on a set of downstream NLU tasks."
413,acl,2020,A Joint Neural Model for Information Extraction with Global Features,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.713,"Joint relation modeling is a curial component in human motion prediction. Most existing methods tend to design skeletal-based graphs to build the relations among joints, where local interactions between joint pairs are well learned. However, the global coordination of all joints, which reflects human motion's balance property, is usually weakened because it is learned from part to whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions are sometimes unnatural. To tackle this issue, we learn a medium, called balance attractor (BA), from the spatiotemporal features of motion to characterize the global motion features, which is subsequently used to build new joint relations. Through the BA, all joints are related synchronously, and thus the global coordination of all joints can be better learned. Based on the BA, we propose our framework, referred to Attractor-Guided Neural Network, mainly including Attractor-Based Joint Relation Extractor (AJRE) and Multi-timescale Dynamics Extractor (MTDE). The AJRE mainly includes Global Coordination Extractor (GCE) and Local Interaction Extractor (LIE). The former presents the global coordination of all joints, and the latter encodes local interactions between joint pairs. The MTDE is designed to extract dynamic information from raw position information for effective prediction. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short and long-term predictions in H3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW."

This paper investigates the task of building a non-goal driven conversational agent, using neural network generative models and analyzes how the conversation context is handled. It compares a simpler Encoder-Decoder with a Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder architecture, which includes an additional module to model the context of the conversation using previous utterances information. We found that the hierarchical model was able to extract relevant context information and include them in the generation of the output. However, it performed worse (35-40%) than the simple Encoder-Decoder model regarding both grammatically correct output and meaningful response. Despite these results, experiments demonstrate how conversations about similar topics appear close to each other in the context space due to the increased frequency of specific topic-related words, thus leaving promising directions for future research and how the context of a conversation can be exploited."

Thus, a crucial research question is how to obtain supervision in a cost-effective way. In this paper, we introduce ""entity triggers,"" an effective proxy of human explanations for facilitating label-efficient learning of NER models. An entity trigger is defined as a group of words in a sentence that helps to explain why humans would recognize an entity in the sentence.   We crowd-sourced 14k entity triggers for two well-studied NER datasets. Our proposed model, Trigger Matching Network, jointly learns trigger representations and soft matching module with self-attention such that can generalize to unseen sentences easily for tagging. Our framework is significantly more cost-effective than the traditional neural NER frameworks. Experiments show that using only 20% of the trigger-annotated sentences results in a comparable performance as using 70% of conventional annotated sentences."

In the cooking domain, the web offers many partially-overlapping text and video recipes (i.e. procedures) that describe how to make the same dish (i.e. high-level task). Aligning instructions for the same dish across different sources can yield descriptive visual explanations that are far richer semantically than conventional textual instructions, providing commonsense insight into how real-world procedures are structured. Learning to align these different instruction sets is challenging because: a) different recipes vary in their order of instructions and use of ingredients; and b) video instructions can be noisy and tend to contain far more information than text instructions. To address these challenges, we first use an unsupervised alignment algorithm that learns pairwise alignments between instructions of different recipes for the same dish. We then use a graph algorithm to derive a joint alignment between multiple text and multiple video recipes for the same dish. We release the Microsoft Research Multimodal Aligned Recipe Corpus containing 150K pairwise alignments between recipes across 4,262 dishes with rich commonsense information."

Advances in natural language processing can help to accelerate this work, using the linguists' past decisions as training material, but questions remain about how to prioritize human involvement. In this extended abstract, we describe the beginnings of a new project that will attempt to ease this language documentation process through the use of natural language processing (NLP) technology. It is based on (1) methods to adapt NLP tools to new languages, based on recent advances in massively multilingual neural networks, and (2) backend APIs and interfaces that allow linguists to upload their data. We then describe our current progress on two fronts: automatic phoneme transcription, and glossing. Finally, we briefly describe our future directions."
418,acl,2020,Named Entity Recognition without Labelled Data: A Weak Supervision Approach,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.139,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance often degrades rapidly when applied to target domains that differ from the texts observed during training. When in-domain labelled data is available, transfer learning techniques can be used to adapt existing NER models to the target domain. But what should one do when there is no hand-labelled data for the target domain? This paper presents a simple but powerful approach to learn NER models in the absence of labelled data through weak supervision. The approach relies on a broad spectrum of labelling functions to automatically annotate texts from the target domain. These annotations are then merged together using a hidden Markov model which captures the varying accuracies and confusions of the labelling functions. A sequence labelling model can finally be trained on the basis of this unified annotation. We evaluate the approach on two English datasets (CoNLL 2003 and news articles from Reuters and Bloomberg) and demonstrate an improvement of about 7 percentage points in entity-level $F_1$ scores compared to an out-of-domain neural NER model."

The research in cognitive science, instead, suggests that understanding is an essential signal for a high-quality chit-chat conversation. Motivated by this, we propose P^2 Bot, a transmitter-receiver based framework with the aim of explicitly modeling understanding. Specifically, P^2 Bot incorporates mutual persona perception to enhance the quality of personalized dialogue generation. Experiments on a large public dataset, Persona-Chat, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a considerable boost over the state-of-the-art baselines across both automatic metrics and human evaluations."

Existing RST parsing pipelines construct rhetorical structures without the knowledge of document-level content structures, which causes relatively low performance when predicting the discourse relations for large text spans. Recognizing the value of high-level content-related information in facilitating discourse relation recognition, we propose a novel pipeline for RST-DP that incorporates structure-aware news content sentence representations derived from the task of News Discourse Profiling. By incorporating only a few additional layers, this enhanced pipeline exhibits promising performance across various RST parsing metrics."

In this paper, we introduce a new model, called RikiNet, which reads Wikipedia pages for natural question answering. RikiNet contains a dynamic paragraph dual-attention reader and a multi-level cascaded answer predictor. The reader dynamically represents the document and question by utilizing a set of complementary attention mechanisms. The representations are then fed into the predictor to obtain the span of the short answer, the paragraph of the long answer, and the answer type in a cascaded manner. On the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset, a single RikiNet achieves 74.3 F1 and 57.9 F1 on long-answer and short-answer tasks. To our best knowledge, it is the first single model that outperforms the single human performance.

This is achieved by carefully introducing instance-level domain-relevance features and automatically constructing a training curriculum to gradually concentrate on multi-domain relevant and noise-reduced data batches.

Although evidence shows recent increases in SUD medication access from expanding Medicaid availability under the Affordable Care Act, it is yet unknown whether these policies also led to a growth in the changes in the nature of hiring in SUDT related workforce, partly due to poor data availability. Our study uses novel data to shed light on recent trends in a fast-evolving and policy-relevant labor market, and contributes to understanding the current SUDT related workforce and the effect of Medicaid expansion on hiring attempts in this sector. We examine attempts over 2010-2018 at hiring in the SUDT and related behavioral health sector as background for estimating the causal effect of the 2014-and-beyond state Medicaid expansion on these outcomes through ""difference-in-difference"" econometric models. We use Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) data covering virtually all U.S. job postings by employers. Nationally, we find little growth in the sector's hiring attempts in 2010-2018 relative to the rest of the economy or to health care as a whole. However, this masks diverging trends in subsectors, which saw reduction in hospital based hiring attempts, increases towards outpatient facilities, and changes in occupational hiring demand shifting from medical personnel towards counselors and social workers. Although Medicaid expansion did not lead to any statistically significant or meaningful change in overall hiring attempts, there was a shift in the hiring landscape."

We propose UPSA, a novel approach that accomplishes Unsupervised Paraphrasing by Simulated Annealing. We model paraphrase generation as an optimization problem and propose a sophisticated objective function, involving semantic similarity, expression diversity, and language fluency of paraphrases. Then, UPSA searches the sentence space towards this objective by performing a sequence of local editing. Our method is unsupervised and does not require parallel corpora for training, so it could be easily applied to different domains. We evaluate our approach on a variety of benchmark datasets, namely, Quora, Wikianswers, MSCOCO, and Twitter. Extensive results show that UPSA achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with previous unsupervised methods in terms of both automatic and human evaluations. Further, our approach outperforms most existing domain-adapted supervised models, showing the generalizability of UPSA."

In each dialog, the recommender proactively leads a multi-type dialog to approach recommendation targets and then makes multiple recommendations with rich interaction behavior. This dataset allows us to systematically investigate different parts of the overall problem, e.g., how to naturally lead a dialog, how to interact with users for recommendation. Finally we establish baseline results on DuRecDial for future studies.

Existing joint intent and slot filling systems analyze and compute features collectively for all slot types, and importantly, have no way to explain the slot filling model decisions. In this work, we propose a novel approach that: (i) learns to generate additional slot type specific features in order to improve accuracy and (ii) provides explanations for slot filling decisions for the first time in a joint NLU model. We perform an additional constrained supervision using a set of binary classifiers for the slot type specific feature learning, thus ensuring appropriate attention weights are learned in the process to explain slot filling decisions for utterances. Our model is inherently explainable and does not need any post-hoc processing. We evaluate our approach on two widely used datasets and show accuracy improvements. Moreover, a detailed analysis is also provided for the exclusive slot explainability."

This paper presents Kernel Graph Attention Network (KGAT), which conducts more fine-grained fact verification with kernel-based attentions. Given a claim and a set of potential evidence sentences that form an evidence graph, KGAT introduces node kernels, which better measure the importance of the evidence node, and edge kernels, which conduct fine-grained evidence propagation in the graph, into Graph Attention Networks for more accurate fact verification. KGAT achieves a 70.38% FEVER score and significantly outperforms existing fact verification models on FEVER, a large-scale benchmark for fact verification. Our analyses illustrate that, compared to dot-product attentions, the kernel-based attention concentrates more on relevant evidence sentences and meaningful clues in the evidence graph, which is the main source of KGAT's effectiveness."

To address this issue, we propose a dynamic token reduction approach to accelerate PLMs' inference, named TR-BERT, which could flexibly adapt the layer number of each token in inference to avoid redundant calculation. Specially, TR-BERT formulates the token reduction process as a multi-step token selection problem and automatically learns the selection strategy via reinforcement learning. The experimental results on several downstream NLP tasks show that TR-BERT is able to speed up BERT by 2-5 times to satisfy various performance demands. Moreover, TR-BERT can also achieve better performance with less computation in a suite of long-text tasks since its token-level layer number adaption greatly accelerates the self-attention operation in PLMs. The source code and experiment details of this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/thunlp/TR-BERT."

Our guiding hypothesis is that a shared set of latent skills underlies many disparate language generation tasks, and that explicitly modelling these skills in a task embedding space can help with both positive transfer across tasks and with efficient adaptation to new tasks. We instantiate this task embedding space as a latent variable in a latent variable sequence-to-sequence model. We evaluate this hypothesis by curating a series of monolingual text-to-text language generation datasets - covering a broad range of tasks and domains - and comparing the performance of models both in the multitask and few-shot regimes. We show that our latent task variable model outperforms other sequence-to-sequence baselines on average across tasks in the multitask setting. In the few-shot learning setting on an unseen test dataset (i.e., a new task), we demonstrate that model adaptation based on inference in the latent task space is more robust than standard fine-tuning based parameter adaptation and performs comparably in terms of overall performance.

Existing works for disfluency detection have focused on designing a single objective only for disfluency detection, while auxiliary objectives utilizing linguistic information of a word such as named entity or part-of-speech information can be effective. In this paper, we focus on detecting disfluencies on spoken transcripts and propose a method utilizing named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) as auxiliary sequence labeling (SL) tasks for disfluency detection. First, we investigate cases that utilizing linguistic information of a word can prevent mispredicting important words and can be helpful for the correct detection of disfluencies. Second, we show that training a disfluency detection model with auxiliary SL tasks can improve its F-score in disfluency detection. Then, we analyze which auxiliary SL tasks are influential depending on baseline models. Experimental results on the widely used English Switchboard dataset show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in disfluency detection."

The Majority of people get their news through social media. At the same time, fake news has grown exponentially on social media platforms in recent years. Several artificial intelligence-based solutions for detecting fake news have shown promising results. On the other hand, these detection systems lack explanation capabilities, i.e., the ability to explain why they made a prediction. This paper highlights the current state of the art in explainable fake news detection. We discuss the pitfalls in the current explainable AI-based fake news detection models and present our ongoing research on multi-modal explainable fake news detection model."
435,acl,2020,Influence Paths for Characterizing Subject-Verb Number Agreement in LSTM Language Models,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.430,"LSTM-based recurrent neural networks are the state-of-the-art for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite their performance, it is unclear whether, or how, LSTMs learn structural features of natural languages such as subject-verb number agreement in English. Lacking this understanding, the generality of LSTM performance on this task and their suitability for related tasks remains uncertain. Further, errors cannot be properly attributed to a lack of structural capability, training data omissions, or other exceptional faults. We introduce *influence paths*, a causal account of structural properties as carried by paths across gates and neurons of a recurrent neural network. The approach refines the notion of influence (the subject's grammatical number has influence on the grammatical number of the subsequent verb) into a set of gate or neuron-level paths. The set localizes and segments the concept (e.g., subject-verb agreement), its constituent elements (e.g., the subject), and related or interfering elements (e.g., attractors). We exemplify the methodology on a widely-studied multi-layer LSTM language model, demonstrating its accounting for subject-verb number agreement. The results offer both a finer and a more complete view of an LSTM's handling of this structural aspect of the English language than prior results based on diagnostic classifiers and ablation."
436,acl,2020,Bipartite Flat-Graph Network for Nested Named Entity Recognition,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.571,"In this paper, we propose a novel bipartite flat-graph network (BiFlaG) for nested named entity recognition (NER), which contains two subgraph modules: a flat NER module for outermost entities and a graph module for all the entities located in inner layers. Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and graph convolutional network (GCN) are adopted to jointly learn flat entities and their inner dependencies. Different from previous models, which only consider the unidirectional delivery of information from innermost layers to outer ones (or outside-to-inside), our model effectively captures the bidirectional interaction between them. We first use the entities recognized by the flat NER module to construct an entity graph, which is fed to the next graph module. The richer representation learned from graph module carries the dependencies of inner entities and can be exploited to improve outermost entity predictions. Experimental results on three standard nested NER datasets demonstrate that our BiFlaG outperforms previous state-of-the-art models."
437,acl,2020,Non-Topical Coherence in Social Talk: A Call for Dialogue Model Enrichment,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-srw.17,"Large-scale open-domain dialogue data crawled from public social media has greatly improved the performance of dialogue models. However, long-turn dialogues are still highly scarce. Specifically, most dialogue sessions in existing corpora have less than three turns. To alleviate this issue, we propose the Retrieve, Reorganize and Rescale framework (Re$^3$Dial), which can automatically construct a billion-scale long-turn dialogue corpus from existing short-turn dialogue data. Re$^3$Dial first trains an Unsupervised Dense Session Retriever (UDSR) to capture semantic and discourse relationships within multi-turn dialogues for retrieving relevant and coherent sessions. It then reorganizes the short-turn dialogues into long-turn sessions via recursively retrieving and selecting the consecutive sessions with our proposed diversity sampling strategy. Extensive evaluations on multiple multi-turn dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that Re$^3$Dial consistently and significantly improves the dialogue model's ability to utilize long-term context for modeling multi-turn dialogues across different pre-training settings. Finally, we build a toolkit for efficiently rescaling dialogue corpus with Re$^3$Dial, which enables us to construct a corpus containing 1B Chinese dialogue sessions with 11.3 turns on average (5X longer than the original EVA corpus). We will release our UDSR model, toolkit, and data for public use."

How to extract users' multiple interests effectively from their historical behavior sequences to improve the relevance and personalization of the recommend results remains an open problem for user modeling.Most existing deep-learning based approaches exploit item-ids and category-ids but neglect fine-grained features like color and mate-rial, which hinders modeling the fine granularity of users' interests.In the paper, we present Multiple interest and Fine granularity Net-work (MFN), which tackle users' multiple and fine-grained interests and construct the model from both the similarity relationship and the combination relationship among the users' multiple interests.Specifically, for modeling the similarity relationship, we leverage two sets of embeddings, where one is the fixed embedding from pre-trained models (e.g. Glove) to give the attention weights and the other is trainable embedding to be trained with MFN together.For modeling the combination relationship, self-attentive layers are exploited to build the higher order combinations of different interest representations. In the construction of network, we design an interest-extract module using attention mechanism to capture multiple interest representations from user historical behavior sequences and leverage an auxiliary loss to boost the distinction of the interest representations. Then a hierarchical network is applied to model the attention relation between the multiple interest vectors of different granularities and the target item. We evaluate MFNon both public and industrial datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MFN achieves superior performance than other existed representing methods."

In this paper, we propose a conversational word embedding method named PR-Embedding, which utilizes the conversation pairs $ \left\langle{post, reply} \right\rangle$ to learn word embedding. Different from previous works, PR-Embedding uses the vectors from two different semantic spaces to represent the words in post and reply. To catch the information among the pair, we first introduce the word alignment model from statistical machine translation to generate the cross-sentence window, then train the embedding on word-level and sentence-level. We evaluate the method on single-turn and multi-turn response selection tasks for retrieval-based dialog systems. The experiment results show that PR-Embedding can improve the quality of the selected response. PR-Embedding source code is available at https://github.com/wtma/PR-Embedding"

Firstly, Carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) classification can help people to understand the properties of enzymes. However, one CAZyme may belong to several classes. This leads to Multi-label CAZyme classification. Secondly, to capture information from the secondary structure of protein, protein classification is modeled as graph classification problem. Thirdly, compound-protein interactions prediction employs graph learning for compound with sequential embedding for protein. This can be seen as classification task for compound-protein pairs. This paper proposes three models for protein classification. Firstly, this paper proposes a Multi-label CAZyme classification model using CNN-LSTM with Attention mechanism. Secondly, this paper proposes a variational graph autoencoder based subspace learning model for protein graph classification. Thirdly, this paper proposes graph isomorphism networks (GIN) and Attention-based CNN-LSTM for compound-protein interactions prediction, as well as comparing GIN with graph convolution networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT) in this task. The proposed models are effective for protein classification. Source code and data are available at https://github.com/zshicode/GNN-AttCL-protein.

As a representative, Lattice-LSTM (Zhang and Yang, 2018) has achieved new benchmark results on several public Chinese NER datasets. However, Lattice-LSTM has a complex model architecture. This limits its application in many industrial areas where real-time NER responses are needed.   In this work, we propose a simple but effective method for incorporating the word lexicon into the character representations. This method avoids designing a complicated sequence modeling architecture, and for any neural NER model, it requires only subtle adjustment of the character representation layer to introduce the lexicon information. Experimental studies on four benchmark Chinese NER datasets show that our method achieves an inference speed up to 6.15 times faster than those of state-ofthe-art methods, along with a better performance. The experimental results also show that the proposed method can be easily incorporated with pre-trained models like BERT."

Previous table-based QA studies focusing on translating natural questions into table queries (NLQ2SQL), however, suffer from the unique nature of EHR data due to complex and specialized medical terminology, hence increased decoding difficulty. In this paper, we design UniQA, a unified encoder-decoder architecture for EHR-QA where natural language questions are converted to queries such as SQL or SPARQL. We also propose input masking (IM), a simple and effective method to cope with complex medical terms and various typos and better learn the SQL/SPARQL syntax. Combining the unified architecture with an effective auxiliary training objective, UniQA demonstrated a significant performance improvement against the previous state-of-the-art model for MIMICSQL* (14.2% gain), the most complex NLQ2SQL dataset in the EHR domain, and its typo-ridden versions (approximately 28.8% gain). In addition, we confirmed consistent results for the graph-based EHR-QA dataset, MIMICSPARQL*."

In this paper, we describe several kinds of stereotypes concerning different communities that are present in popular sentence representation models, including pretrained next sentence prediction and contrastive sentence representation models. We compare such models to textual entailment models that learn language logic for a variety of downstream language understanding tasks. By comparing strong pretrained models based on text similarity with textual entailment learning, we conclude that the explicit logic learning with textual entailment can significantly reduce bias and improve the recognition of social communities, without an explicit de-biasing process"

Authorship obfuscation, on the other hand, aims to protect against authorship attribution by modifying a text's style. In this paper, we evaluate the stealthiness of state-of-the-art authorship obfuscation methods under an adversarial threat model. An obfuscator is stealthy to the extent an adversary finds it challenging to detect whether or not a text modified by the obfuscator is obfuscated - a decision that is key to the adversary interested in authorship attribution. We show that the existing authorship obfuscation methods are not stealthy as their obfuscated texts can be identified with an average F1 score of 0.87. The reason for the lack of stealthiness is that these obfuscators degrade text smoothness, as ascertained by neural language models, in a detectable manner. Our results highlight the need to develop stealthy authorship obfuscation methods that can better protect the identity of an author seeking anonymity."

However, they are limited by their - (i) inability to learn cross-modal representations across text, layout and image dimensions for documents and (ii) inability to process multi-page documents. Pre-training techniques have been shown in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain to learn generic textual representations from large unlabelled datasets, applicable to various downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning-based framework that utilizes a combination of self-supervised and supervised pre-training tasks to learn a generic document representation applicable to various downstream document tasks. Specifically, we introduce Document Topic Modelling and Document Shuffle Prediction as novel pre-training tasks to learn rich image representations along with the text and layout representations for documents. We utilize the Longformer network architecture as the backbone to encode the multi-modal information from multi-page documents in an end-to-end fashion. We showcase the applicability of our pre-training framework on a variety of different real-world document tasks such as document classification, document information extraction, and document retrieval.

However, we observed that bottleneck autoencoders produce subjectively low quality reconstructed images. In this work, we explore the ability of sparse coding to improve reconstructed image quality for the same degree of compression. We observe that sparse image compression produces visually superior reconstructed images and yields higher values of pixel-wise measures of reconstruction quality (PSNR and SSIM) compared to bottleneck autoencoders. % In addition, we find that using alternative metrics that correlate better with human perception, such as feature perceptual loss and the classification accuracy, sparse image compression scores up to 18.06\% and 2.7\% higher, respectively, compared to bottleneck autoencoders. Although computationally much more intensive, we find that sparse coding is otherwise superior to bottleneck autoencoders for the same degree of compression."

In existing work, a weighted Tchebycheff MOBO approach has been demonstrated which attempts to estimate the unknown utopia in formulating acquisition function, through calibration using a priori selected regression model. However, the existing MOBO model lacks flexibility in selecting the appropriate regression models given the guided sampled data and therefore, can under-fit or over-fit as the iterations of the MOBO progress, reducing the overall MOBO performance. As it is too complex to a priori guarantee a best model in general, this motivates us to consider a portfolio of different families of predictive models fitted with current training data, guided by the WTB MOBO; the best model is selected following a user-defined prediction root mean-square-error-based approach. The proposed approach is implemented in optimizing a multi-modal benchmark problem and a thin tube design under constant loading of temperature-pressure, with minimizing the risk of creep-fatigue failure and design cost. Finally, the nested weighted Tchebycheff MOBO model performance is compared with different MOBO frameworks with respect to accuracy in parameter estimation, Pareto-optimal solutions and function evaluation cost. This method is generalized enough to consider different families of predictive models in the portfolio for best model selection, where the overall design architecture allows for solving any high-dimensional (multiple functions) complex black-box problems and can be extended to any other global criterion multi-objective optimization methods where prior knowledge of utopia is required."

This problem is typically addressed by either pre-processing words into subword units or performing translation directly at the level of characters. The former is based on word segmentation algorithms optimized using corpus-level statistics with no regard to the translation task. The latter learns directly from translation data but requires rather deep architectures. In this paper, we propose to translate words by modeling word formation through a hierarchical latent variable model which mimics the process of morphological inflection. Our model generates words one character at a time by composing two latent representations: a continuous one, aimed at capturing the lexical semantics, and a set of (approximately) discrete features, aimed at capturing the morphosyntactic function, which are shared among different surface forms. Our model achieves better accuracy in translation into three morphologically-rich languages than conventional open-vocabulary NMT methods, while also demonstrating a better generalization capacity under low to mid-resource settings."

When working with edge devices these desiderata are usually achieved through replication and offloading. This paper reports on the design and implementation of Workrs, a fault tolerant service that enables the offloading of jobs from devices with limited computational power. We propose a solution that allows users to upload jobs through a web service, which will be executed on edge nodes within the system. The solution is designed to be fault tolerant and scalable, with no single point of failure as well as the ability to accommodate growth, if the service is expanded. The use of Docker checkpointing on the worker machines ensures that jobs can be resumed in the event of a fault. We provide a mathematical approach to optimize the number of checkpoints that are created along a computation, given that we can forecast the time needed to execute a job. We present experiments that indicate in which scenarios checkpointing benefits job execution. The results achieved are based on a working prototype which shows clear benefits of using checkpointing and restore when the completion jobs' time rises compared with the forecast fault rate. The code of Workrs is released as open source, and it is available at \url{https://github.com/orgs/P7-workrs/repositories}. This paper is an extended version of \cite{edge2023paper}."

We run a battery of supervised machine learning models for automatically detecting parody tweets with an emphasis on robustness by testing on tweets from accounts unseen in training, across different genders and across countries. Our results show that political parody tweets can be predicted with an accuracy up to 90%. Finally, we identify the markers of parody through a linguistic analysis.

It is therefore necessary to extract information from medical reports to conduct clinical studies. Transfer learning with BERT-like models such as CamemBERT has allowed major advances, especially for named entity recognition. However, these models are trained for plain language and are less efficient on biomedical data. This is why we propose a new French public biomedical dataset on which we have continued the pre-training of CamemBERT. Thus, we introduce a first version of CamemBERT-bio, a specialized public model for the French biomedical domain that shows 2.54 points of F1 score improvement on average on different biomedical named entity recognition tasks.

We propose a FAQ retrieval system that considers the similarity between a user's query and a question as well as the relevance between the query and an answer. Although a common approach to FAQ retrieval is to construct labeled data for training, it takes annotation costs. Therefore, we use a traditional unsupervised information retrieval system to calculate the similarity between the query and question. On the other hand, the relevance between the query and answer can be learned by using QA pairs in a FAQ database. The recently-proposed BERT model is used for the relevance calculation. Since the number of QA pairs in FAQ page is not enough to train a model, we cope with this issue by leveraging FAQ sets that are similar to the one in question. We evaluate our approach on two datasets. The first one is localgovFAQ, a dataset we construct in a Japanese administrative municipality domain. The second is StackExchange dataset, which is the public dataset in English. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods on these datasets."

Judging whether, and to what extent, automatic metrics concur with the gold standard of human evaluation is not a straightforward problem. We show that current methods for judging metrics are highly sensitive to the translations used for assessment, particularly the presence of outliers, which often leads to falsely confident conclusions about a metric's efficacy. Finally, we turn to pairwise system ranking, developing a method for thresholding performance improvement under an automatic metric against human judgements, which allows quantification of type I versus type II errors incurred, i.e., insignificant human differences in system quality that are accepted, and significant human differences that are rejected. Together, these findings suggest improvements to the protocols for metric evaluation and system performance evaluation in machine translation."

However, we have a concern about the truthfulness of generated summaries: whether all facts of a generated summary are mentioned in the source text. This paper explores improving the truthfulness in headline generation on two popular datasets. Analyzing headlines generated by the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder model, we show that the model sometimes generates untruthful headlines. We conjecture that one of the reasons lies in untruthful supervision data used for training the model. In order to quantify the truthfulness of article-headline pairs, we consider the textual entailment of whether an article entails its headline. After confirming quite a few untruthful instances in the datasets, this study hypothesizes that removing untruthful instances from the supervision data may remedy the problem of the untruthful behaviors of the model. Building a binary classifier that predicts an entailment relation between an article and its headline, we filter out untruthful instances from the supervision data. Experimental results demonstrate that the headline generation model trained on filtered supervision data shows no clear difference in ROUGE scores but remarkable improvements in automatic and manual evaluations of the generated headlines."

Researchers approach this enterprise by training ""probes"" - supervised models designed to extract linguistic structure from another model's output. One such probe is the structural probe (Hewitt and Manning, 2019), designed to quantify the extent to which syntactic information is encoded in contextualised word representations. The structural probe has a novel design, unattested in the parsing literature, the precise benefit of which is not immediately obvious. To explore whether syntactic probes would do better to make use of existing techniques, we compare the structural probe to a more traditional parser with an identical lightweight parameterisation. The parser outperforms structural probe on UUAS in seven of nine analysed languages, often by a substantial amount (e.g. by 11.1 points in English). Under a second less common metric, however, there is the opposite trend - the structural probe outperforms the parser. This begs the question: which metric should we prefer?"

In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between abstractiveness and factuality of generated summaries across multiple datasets and models, using extensive human evaluations of factuality. In our analysis, we visualize the rates of change in factuality as we gradually increase abstractiveness using a decoding constraint, and we observe that, while increased abstractiveness generally leads to a drop in factuality, the rate of factuality decay depends on factors such as the data that the system was trained on. We introduce two datasets with human factuality judgements; one containing 10.2k generated summaries with systematically varied degrees of abstractiveness; the other containing 4.2k summaries from five different summarization models. We propose new factuality metrics that adjust for the degree of abstractiveness, and we use them to compare the abstractiveness-adjusted factuality of previous summarization works, providing baselines for future work."

Our model extends the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with two new ingredients: first, we propose a modified evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective which explicitly promotes mutual information; second, we regularize the probabilities of the decoder by mixing an auxiliary factorized distribution which is directly predicted by the latent variables. We present empirical results on the Transformer architecture and show the proposed model effectively addressed posterior collapse: latent variables are no longer ignored in the presence of powerful decoder. As a result, the proposed model yields improved translation quality while demonstrating superior performance in terms of data efficiency and robustness."
463,acl,2020,Inflecting When There&apos;s No Majority: Limitations of Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks as Cognitive Models for German Plurals,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.159,"Can artificial neural networks learn to represent inflectional morphology and generalize to new words as human speakers do? Kirov and Cotterell (2018) argue that the answer is yes: modern Encoder-Decoder (ED) architectures learn human-like behavior when inflecting English verbs, such as extending the regular past tense form -(e)d to novel words. However, their work does not address the criticism raised by Marcus et al. (1995): that neural models may learn to extend not the regular, but the most frequent class -- and thus fail on tasks like German number inflection, where infrequent suffixes like -s can still be productively generalized.   To investigate this question, we first collect a new dataset from German speakers (production and ratings of plural forms for novel nouns) that is designed to avoid sources of information unavailable to the ED model. The speaker data show high variability, and two suffixes evince 'regular' behavior, appearing more often with phonologically atypical inputs. Encoder-decoder models do generalize the most frequently produced plural class, but do not show human-like variability or 'regular' extension of these other plural markers. We conclude that modern neural models may still struggle with minority-class generalization."

We propose an automatic humor generation framework for filling the blanks in Mad Libs stories, while accounting for the demographic backgrounds of the desired audience. We collect a dataset consisting of such stories, which are filled in and judged by carefully selected workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We build upon the BERT platform to predict location-biased word fillings in incomplete sentences, and we fine tune BERT to classify location-specific humor in a sentence. We leverage these components to produce YodaLib, a fully-automated Mad Libs style humor generation framework, which selects and ranks appropriate candidate words and sentences in order to generate a coherent and funny story tailored to certain demographics. Our experimental results indicate that YodaLib outperforms a previous semi-automated approach proposed for this task, while also surpassing human annotators in both qualitative and quantitative analyses."

Standard language generation metrics have been shown to be ineffective for evaluating dialog models. To this end, this paper presents USR, an UnSupervised and Reference-free evaluation metric for dialog. USR is a reference-free metric that trains unsupervised models to measure several desirable qualities of dialog. USR is shown to strongly correlate with human judgment on both Topical-Chat (turn-level: 0.42, system-level: 1.0) and PersonaChat (turn-level: 0.48 and system-level: 1.0). USR additionally produces interpretable measures for several desirable properties of dialog."

To enhance the wake word detection system's robustness on such scenarios, we investigate two data augmentation setups for training end-to-end KWS systems. One is involving the synthesized data from a multi-speaker speech synthesis system, and the other augmentation is performed by adding random noise to the acoustic feature. Experimental results show that augmentations help improve the system's robustness. Moreover, by augmenting the training set with the synthetic data generated by the multi-speaker text-to-speech system, we achieve a significant improvement regarding confusing words scenario."
467,acl,2020,Generalized Entropy Regularization or: There&apos;s Nothing Special about Label Smoothing,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.615,"Prior work has explored directly regularizing the output distributions of probabilistic models to alleviate peaky (i.e. over-confident) predictions, a common sign of overfitting. This class of techniques, of which label smoothing is one, has a connection to entropy regularization. Despite the consistent success of label smoothing across architectures and data sets in language generation tasks, two problems remain open: (1) there is little understanding of the underlying effects entropy regularizers have on models, and (2) the full space of entropy regularization techniques is largely unexplored. We introduce a parametric family of entropy regularizers, which includes label smoothing as a special case, and use it to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the entropy of a model and its performance on language generation tasks. We also find that variance in model performance can be explained largely by the resulting entropy of the model. Lastly, we find that label smoothing provably does not allow for sparsity in an output distribution, an undesirable property for language generation models, and therefore advise the use of other entropy regularization methods in its place."
468,acl,2020,Contextualized Weak Supervision for Text Classification,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.30,"Text classification typically requires a substantial amount of human-annotated data to serve as supervision, which is costly to obtain in dynamic emerging domains. Certain methods seek to address this problem by solely relying on the surface text of class names to serve as extremely weak supervision. However, existing methods fail to account for single-class documents discussing multiple topics. Both topic diversity and vague sentences may introduce noise into the document's underlying representation and consequently the precision of the predicted class. Furthermore, current work focuses on text granularities (documents, sentences, or words) independently, which limits the degree of coarse- or fine-grained context that we can jointly extract from all three to identify significant subtext for classification. In order to address this problem, we propose MEGClass, an extremely weakly-supervised text classification method to exploit Mutually-Enhancing Text Granularities. Specifically, MEGClass constructs class-oriented sentence and class representations based on keywords for performing a sentence-level confidence-weighted label ensemble in order to estimate a document's initial class distribution. This serves as the target distribution for a multi-head attention network with a class-weighted contrastive loss. This network learns contextualized sentence representations and weights to form document representations that reflect its original document and sentence-level topic diversity. Retaining this heterogeneity allows MEGClass to select the most class-indicative documents to serve as iterative feedback for enhancing the class representations. Finally, these top documents are used to fine-tune a pre-trained text classifier. As demonstrated through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, MEGClass outperforms other weakly and extremely weakly supervised methods."
469,acl,2020,A Formal Hierarchy of RNN Architectures,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.43,"We develop a formal hierarchy of the expressive capacity of RNN architectures. The hierarchy is based on two formal properties: space complexity, which measures the RNN's memory, and rational recurrence, defined as whether the recurrent update can be described by a weighted finite-state machine. We place several RNN variants within this hierarchy. For example, we prove the LSTM is not rational, which formally separates it from the related QRNN (Bradbury et al., 2016). We also show how these models' expressive capacity is expanded by stacking multiple layers or composing them with different pooling functions. Our results build on the theory of ""saturated"" RNNs (Merrill, 2019). While formally extending these findings to unsaturated RNNs is left to future work, we hypothesize that the practical learnable capacity of unsaturated RNNs obeys a similar hierarchy. Experimental findings from training unsaturated networks on formal languages support this conjecture."
470,acl,2020,Dialogue Coherence Assessment Without Explicit Dialogue Act Labels,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.133,"Recent dialogue coherence models use the coherence features designed for monologue texts, e.g. nominal entities, to represent utterances and then explicitly augment them with dialogue-relevant features, e.g., dialogue act labels. It indicates two drawbacks, (a) semantics of utterances is limited to entity mentions, and (b) the performance of coherence models strongly relies on the quality of the input dialogue act labels. We address these issues by introducing a novel approach to dialogue coherence assessment. We use dialogue act prediction as an auxiliary task in a multi-task learning scenario to obtain informative utterance representations for coherence assessment. Our approach alleviates the need for explicit dialogue act labels during evaluation. The results of our experiments show that our model substantially (more than 20 accuracy points) outperforms its strong competitors on the DailyDialogue corpus, and performs on par with them on the SwitchBoard corpus for ranking dialogues concerning their coherence."

Existing MWP corpora for studying AI progress remain limited either in language usage patterns or in problem types. We thus present a new English MWP corpus with 2,305 MWPs that cover more text patterns and most problem types taught in elementary school. Each MWP is annotated with its problem type and grade level (for indicating the level of difficulty). Furthermore, we propose a metric to measure the lexicon usage diversity of a given MWP corpus, and demonstrate that ASDiv is more diverse than existing corpora. Experiments show that our proposed corpus reflects the true capability of MWP solvers more faithfully."

Tailoring Pre-trained Language Models via Monte-Carlo Methods,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.314,"It has been a common approach to pre-train a language model on a large corpus and fine-tune it on task-specific data. In practice, we observe that fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a small dataset may lead to over- and/or under-estimation problem. In this paper, we propose MC-Tailor, a novel method to alleviate the above issue in text generation tasks by truncating and transferring the probability mass from over-estimated regions to under-estimated ones. Experiments on a variety of text generation datasets show that MC-Tailor consistently and significantly outperforms the fine-tuning approach. Our code is available at this url."

We hypothesize that this issue is not primarily caused by the pretrained model's limitations, but rather by the paucity of crowdsourced NLI examples that might convey the importance of syntactic structure at the fine-tuning stage. We explore several methods to augment standard training sets with syntactically informative examples, generated by applying syntactic transformations to sentences from the MNLI corpus. The best-performing augmentation method, subject/object inversion, improved BERT's accuracy on controlled examples that diagnose sensitivity to word order from 0.28 to 0.73, without affecting performance on the MNLI test set. This improvement generalized beyond the particular construction used for data augmentation, suggesting that augmentation causes BERT to recruit abstract syntactic representations."

We explore questions such as: how well cited are papers of different types (journal articles, conference papers, demo papers, etc.)? how well cited are papers from different areas of within NLP? etc. Notably, we show that only about 56\% of the papers in AA are cited ten or more times. CL Journal has the most cited papers, but its citation dominance has lessened in recent years. On average, long papers get almost three times as many citations as short papers; and papers on sentiment classification, anaphora resolution, and entity recognition have the highest median citations.

Measuring gender gaps is a crucial step towards addressing them. In this work, we examine female first author percentages and the citations to their papers in Natural Language Processing (1965 to 2019). We determine aggregate-level statistics using an existing manually curated author--gender list as well as first names strongly associated with a gender. We find that only about 29% of first authors are female and only about 25% of last authors are female. Notably, this percentage has not improved since the mid 2000s. We also show that, on average, female first authors are cited less than male first authors, even when controlling for experience and area of research. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations involved in automatic demographic analysis."

The evolution of these scenarios is highly uncertain and depends on the interactions of agents with static and dynamic objects in the scene. GNN-based approaches have recently gained attention as they are well suited to naturally model these interactions. However, one of the main challenges that remains unexplored is how to address the complexity and opacity of these models in order to deal with the transparency requirements for autonomous driving systems, which includes aspects such as interpretability and explainability. In this work, we aim to improve the explainability of motion prediction systems by using different approaches. First, we propose a new Explainable Heterogeneous Graph-based Policy (XHGP) model based on an heterograph representation of the traffic scene and lane-graph traversals, which learns interaction behaviors using object-level and type-level attention. This learned attention provides information about the most important agents and interactions in the scene. Second, we explore this same idea with the explanations provided by GNNExplainer. Third, we apply counterfactual reasoning to provide explanations of selected individual scenarios by exploring the sensitivity of the trained model to changes made to the input data, i.e., masking some elements of the scene, modifying trajectories, and adding or removing dynamic agents. The explainability analysis provided in this paper is a first step towards more transparent and reliable motion prediction systems, important from the perspective of the user, developers and regulatory agencies.

We compare the Eisner algorithm and the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm in the task and find that using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm generates deeper trees and achieves better performance. We also evaluate the structure of the output of the parser with average maximum path length and average proportion of leaf nodes and find that the dependency trees generated by the parser are close to the gold trees. As the corpus allows non-projective structures, we analyze the complexity of non-projectivity of the corpus and find that the dependency structures in this corpus have gap degree at most one and edge degree at most one."

Inspired by this, we define a new task, namely stylized data-to-text generation, whose aim is to generate coherent text for the given non-linguistic data according to a specific style. This task is non-trivial, due to three challenges: the logic of the generated text, unstructured style reference, and biased training samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized data-to-text generation model, named StyleD2T, comprising three components: logic planning-enhanced data embedding, mask-based style embedding, and unbiased stylized text generation. In the first component, we introduce a graph-guided logic planner for attribute organization to ensure the logic of generated text. In the second component, we devise feature-level mask-based style embedding to extract the essential style signal from the given unstructured style reference. In the last one, pseudo triplet augmentation is utilized to achieve unbiased text generation, and a multi-condition based confidence assignment function is designed to ensure the quality of pseudo samples. Extensive experiments on a newly collected dataset from Taobao have been conducted, and the results show the superiority of our model over existing methods."

We use language to improve few-shot visual classification in the underexplored scenario where natural language task descriptions are available during training, but unavailable for novel tasks at test time. Existing models for this setting sample new descriptions at test time and use those to classify images. Instead, we propose language-shaped learning (LSL), an end-to-end model that regularizes visual representations to predict language. LSL is conceptually simpler, more data efficient, and outperforms baselines in two challenging few-shot domains."

This motivates us to consider polyglot named-entity recognition (NER), where one model is trained using annotated data drawn from more than one language. However, a straightforward implementation of this simple idea does not always work in practice: naive training of NER models using annotated data drawn from multiple languages consistently underperforms models trained on monolingual data alone, despite having access to more training data. The starting point of this paper is a simple solution to this problem, in which polyglot models are fine-tuned on monolingual data to consistently and significantly outperform their monolingual counterparts. To explain this phenomena, we explore the sources of multilingual transfer in polyglot NER models and examine the weight structure of polyglot models compared to their monolingual counterparts. We find that polyglot models efficiently share many parameters across languages and that fine-tuning may utilize a large number of those parameters."

Furthermore, existing work has not provided a clear picture about the model properties required to produce proper syntactic generalizations. We present a systematic evaluation of the syntactic knowledge of neural language models, testing 20 combinations of model types and data sizes on a set of 34 English-language syntactic test suites. We find substantial differences in syntactic generalization performance by model architecture, with sequential models underperforming other architectures. Factorially manipulating model architecture and training dataset size (1M--40M words), we find that variability in syntactic generalization performance is substantially greater by architecture than by dataset size for the corpora tested in our experiments. Our results also reveal a dissociation between perplexity and syntactic generalization performance."

This requires a better semantic understanding of the user's intent and its contextual meaning. Multilingual semantic search is less explored and more challenging than its monolingual or bilingual counterparts, due to the lack of multilingual parallel resources for this task and the need to circumvent ""language bias"". In this work, we propose an alignment approach: MAML-Align, specifically for low-resource scenarios. Our approach leverages meta-distillation learning based on MAML, an optimization-based Model-Agnostic Meta-Learner. MAML-Align distills knowledge from a Teacher meta-transfer model T-MAML, specialized in transferring from monolingual to bilingual semantic search, to a Student model S-MAML, which meta-transfers from bilingual to multilingual semantic search. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to extend meta-distillation to a multilingual search application. Our empirical results show that on top of a strong baseline based on sentence transformers, our meta-distillation approach boosts the gains provided by MAML and significantly outperforms naive fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, multilingual meta-distillation learning improves generalization even to unseen languages."

In this paper, we attempt to model Nen verbal morphology using state-of-the-art machine learning models for morphological reinflection. We explore and categorise the types of errors these systems generate.

ADA uses adversarial training to construct representations that are predictive for trigger identification, but not predictive of the example's domain. It requires no labeled data from the target domain, making it completely unsupervised. Experiments with two domains (English literature and news) show that ADA leads to an average F1 score improvement of 3.9 on out-of-domain data. Our best performing model (BERT-A) reaches 44-49 F1 across both domains, using no labeled target data.

We employ a vanilla noise model at training time. For evaluation, we use both the original data and its variants perturbed with real OCR errors and misspellings.

Existing approaches construct static document-level graphs based on syntactic trees, co-references or heuristics from the unstructured text to model the dependencies. Unlike previous methods that may not be able to capture rich non-local interactions for inference, we propose a novel model that empowers the relational reasoning across sentences by automatically inducing the latent document-level graph. We further develop a refinement strategy, which enables the model to incrementally aggregate relevant information for multi-hop reasoning. Specifically, our model achieves an F1 score of 59.05 on a large-scale document-level dataset (DocRED), significantly improving over the previous results, and also yields new state-of-the-art results on the CDR and GDA dataset. Furthermore, extensive analyses show that the model is able to discover more accurate inter-sentence relations."

In this work, we cast nested NER to constituency parsing and propose a novel pointing mechanism for bottom-up parsing to tackle both tasks. The key idea is based on the observation that if we traverse a constituency tree in post-order, i.e., visiting a parent after its children, then two consecutively visited spans would share a boundary. Our model tracks the shared boundaries and predicts the next boundary at each step by leveraging a pointer network. As a result, it needs only linear steps to parse and thus is efficient. It also maintains a parsing configuration for structural consistency, i.e., always outputting valid trees. Experimentally, our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on PTB among all BERT-based models (96.01 F1 score) and competitive performance on CTB7 in constituency parsing; and it also achieves strong performance on three benchmark datasets of nested NER: ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA.

To this end, we introduce a novel embedding model, named R-MeN, that explores a relational memory network to encode potential dependencies in relationship triples. R-MeN considers each triple as a sequence of 3 input vectors that recurrently interact with a memory using a transformer self-attention mechanism. Thus R-MeN encodes new information from interactions between the memory and each input vector to return a corresponding vector. Consequently, R-MeN feeds these 3 returned vectors to a convolutional neural network-based decoder to produce a scalar score for the triple. Experimental results show that our proposed R-MeN obtains state-of-the-art results on SEARCH17 for the search personalization task, and on WN11 and FB13 for the triple classification task."

Ranking products retrieved from search becomes crucial to address customer's need and optimize for business metrics. While learning to Rank (LETOR) models have been extensively studied and have demonstrated efficacy in the context of web search; it is a relatively new research area to be explored in the e-commerce. In this paper, we present a framework for building LETOR model for an e-commerce platform. We analyze user queries and propose a mechanism to segment queries between broad and narrow based on user's intent. We discuss different types of features - query, product and query-product and discuss challenges in using them. We show that sparsity in product features can be tackled through a denoising auto-encoder while skip-gram based word embeddings help solve the query-product sparsity issues. We also present various target metrics that can be employed for evaluating search results and compare their robustness. Further, we build and compare performances of both pointwise and pairwise LETOR models on fashion category data set. We also build and compare distinct models for broad and narrow queries, analyze feature importance across these and show that these specialized models perform better than a combined model in the fashion world."

However, recent studies reveal that the robustness of these models can be challenged by carefully crafted textual adversarial examples. While several individual datasets have been proposed to evaluate model robustness, a principled and comprehensive benchmark is still missing. In this paper, we present Adversarial GLUE (AdvGLUE), a new multi-task benchmark to quantitatively and thoroughly explore and evaluate the vulnerabilities of modern large-scale language models under various types of adversarial attacks. In particular, we systematically apply 14 textual adversarial attack methods to GLUE tasks to construct AdvGLUE, which is further validated by humans for reliable annotations. Our findings are summarized as follows. (i) Most existing adversarial attack algorithms are prone to generating invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, with around 90% of them either changing the original semantic meanings or misleading human annotators as well. Therefore, we perform a careful filtering process to curate a high-quality benchmark. (ii) All the language models and robust training methods we tested perform poorly on AdvGLUE, with scores lagging far behind the benign accuracy. We hope our work will motivate the development of new adversarial attacks that are more stealthy and semantic-preserving, as well as new robust language models against sophisticated adversarial attacks. AdvGLUE is available at https://adversarialglue.github.io."

Nevertheless, little empirical work has been done on quantifying the prevalence of different syntactic divergences across language pairs. We propose a framework for extracting divergence patterns for any language pair from a parallel corpus, building on Universal Dependencies. We show that our framework provides a detailed picture of cross-language divergences, generalizes previous approaches, and lends itself to full automation. We further present a novel dataset, a manually word-aligned subset of the Parallel UD corpus in five languages, and use it to perform a detailed corpus study. We demonstrate the usefulness of the resulting analysis by showing that it can help account for performance patterns of a cross-lingual parser."

The former seeks the most relevant information from a reference text, while the latter is to locate or generate answers from the extracted evidence. Despite the importance of evidence labels for training the evidence extractor, they are not cheaply accessible, particularly in many non-extractive MRC tasks such as YES/NO question answering and multi-choice MRC.   To address this problem, we present a Self-Training method (STM), which supervises the evidence extractor with auto-generated evidence labels in an iterative process. At each iteration, a base MRC model is trained with golden answers and noisy evidence labels. The trained model will predict pseudo evidence labels as extra supervision in the next iteration. We evaluate STM on seven datasets over three MRC tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the improvement on existing MRC models, and we also analyze how and why such a self-training method works in MRC. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/SparkJiao/Self-Training-MRC"

Robustness to such perturbations is typically measured using translation quality metrics such as BLEU on the noisy input. This paper proposes additional metrics which measure the relative degradation and changes in translation when small perturbations are added to the input. We focus on a class of models employing subword regularization to address robustness and perform extensive evaluations of these models using the robustness measures proposed. Results show that our proposed metrics reveal a clear trend of improved robustness to perturbations when subword regularization methods are used.
499,acl,2020,An Analysis of the Utility of Explicit Negative Examples to Improve the Syntactic Abilities of Neural Language Models,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.309,"We explore the utilities of explicit negative examples in training neural language models. Negative examples here are incorrect words in a sentence, such as ""barks"" in ""*The dogs barks"". Neural language models are commonly trained only on positive examples, a set of sentences in the training data, but recent studies suggest that the models trained in this way are not capable of robustly handling complex syntactic constructions, such as long-distance agreement. In this paper, using English data, we first demonstrate that appropriately using negative examples about particular constructions (e.g., subject-verb agreement) will boost the model's robustness on them, with a negligible loss of perplexity. The key to our success is an additional margin loss between the log-likelihoods of a correct word and an incorrect word. We then provide a detailed analysis of the trained models. One of our findings is the difficulty of object-relative clauses for RNNs. We find that even with our direct learning signals the models still suffer from resolving agreement across an object-relative clause. Augmentation of training sentences involving the constructions somewhat helps, but the accuracy still does not reach the level of subject-relative clauses. Although not directly cognitively appealing, our method can be a tool to analyze the true architectural limitation of neural models on challenging linguistic constructions."

In order to interpret discrete data in continuous time, current implementations rely on non-causal interpolations of the data. This is fine when the whole time series is observed in advance, but means that Neural CDEs are not suitable for use in \textit{online prediction tasks}, where predictions need to be made in real-time: a major use case for recurrent networks. Here, we show how this limitation may be rectified. First, we identify several theoretical conditions that interpolation schemes for Neural CDEs should satisfy, such as boundedness and uniqueness. Second, we use these to motivate the introduction of new schemes that address these conditions, offering in particular measurability (for online prediction), and smoothness (for speed). Third, we empirically benchmark our online Neural CDE model on three continuous monitoring tasks from the MIMIC-IV medical database: we demonstrate improved performance on all tasks against ODE benchmarks, and on two of the three tasks against SOTA non-ODE benchmarks."
501,acl,2020,Text Classification with Negative Supervision,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.33,"For high-resource languages like English, text classification is a well-studied task. The performance of modern NLP models easily achieves an accuracy of more than 90% in many standard datasets for text classification in English (Xie et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Zaheer et al., 2020). However, text classification in low-resource languages is still challenging due to the lack of annotated data. Although methods like weak supervision and crowdsourcing can help ease the annotation bottleneck, the annotations obtained by these methods contain label noise. Models trained with label noise may not generalize well. To this end, a variety of noise-handling techniques have been proposed to alleviate the negative impact caused by the errors in the annotations (for extensive surveys see (Hedderich et al., 2021; Algan & Ulusoy, 2021)). In this work, we experiment with a group of standard noisy-handling methods on text classification tasks with noisy labels. We study both simulated noise and realistic noise induced by weak supervision. Moreover, we find task-adaptive pre-training techniques (Gururangan et al., 2020) are beneficial for learning with noisy labels."

However, the creation of multilingual multimodal evaluation datasets (e.g. Multi30K, xGQA, XVNLI, and MaRVL) poses a new challenge in finding high-quality training data that is both multilingual and multimodal. In this paper, we investigate whether machine translating English multimodal data can be an effective proxy for the lack of readily available multilingual data. We call this framework TD-MML: Translated Data for Multilingual Multimodal Learning, and it can be applied to any multimodal dataset and model. We apply it to both pretraining and fine-tuning data with a state-of-the-art model. In order to prevent models from learning from low-quality translated text, we propose two metrics for automatically removing such translations from the resulting datasets. In experiments on five tasks across 20 languages in the IGLUE benchmark, we show that translated data can provide a useful signal for multilingual multimodal learning, both at pretraining and fine-tuning."

The former occurs when an utterance is sarcastic from the perspective of its author, while the latter occurs when the utterance is interpreted as sarcastic by the audience. We show the limitations of previous labelling methods in capturing intended sarcasm and introduce the iSarcasm dataset of tweets labeled for sarcasm directly by their authors. Examining the state-of-the-art sarcasm detection models on our dataset showed low performance compared to previously studied datasets, which indicates that these datasets might be biased or obvious and sarcasm could be a phenomenon under-studied computationally thus far. By providing the iSarcasm dataset, we aim to encourage future NLP research to develop methods for detecting sarcasm in text as intended by the authors of the text, not as labeled under assumptions that we demonstrate to be sub-optimal."

With the shift from traditional news outlets to social media and similar venues, a major concern is that readers are becoming encapsulated in ""echo chambers"" and may fall prey to fake news and disinformation, lacking easy access to dissenting views. We suggest a novel task aiming to alleviate some of these concerns -- that of detecting articles that most effectively counter the arguments -- and not just the stance -- made in a given text. We study this problem in the context of debate speeches. Given such a speech, we aim to identify, from among a set of speeches on the same topic and with an opposing stance, the ones that directly counter it. We provide a large dataset of 3,685 such speeches (in English), annotated for this relation, which hopefully would be of general interest to the NLP community. We explore several algorithms addressing this task, and while some are successful, all fall short of expert human performance, suggesting room for further research.

At inference time, each span is assigned a class label based on its similar spans in the training set, where it is easy to understand how much each training instance contributes to the predictions.

However, no matter how the dialogue history is used, each existing model uses its own consistent dialogue history during the entire state tracking process, regardless of which slot is updated. Apparently, it requires different dialogue history to update different slots in different turns. Therefore, using consistent dialogue contents may lead to insufficient or redundant information for different slots, which affects the overall performance. To address this problem, we devise DiCoS-DST to dynamically select the relevant dialogue contents corresponding to each slot for state updating. Specifically, it first retrieves turn-level utterances of dialogue history and evaluates their relevance to the slot from a combination of three perspectives: (1) its explicit connection to the slot name; (2) its relevance to the current turn dialogue; (3) Implicit Mention Oriented Reasoning. Then these perspectives are combined to yield a decision, and only the selected dialogue contents are fed into State Generator, which explicitly minimizes the distracting information passed to the downstream state prediction. Experimental results show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on MultiWOZ 2.1 and MultiWOZ 2.2, and achieves superior performance on multiple mainstream benchmark datasets (including Sim-M, Sim-R, and DSTC2)."

However, standard one-size-fits-all automatic speech recognition models perform poorly when applied to aphasic speech. One reason for this is the wide range of speech intelligibility due to different levels of severity (i.e., higher severity lends itself to less intelligible speech). To address this, we propose a novel acoustic model based on a mixture of experts (MoE), which handles the varying intelligibility stages present in aphasic speech by explicitly defining severity-based experts. At test time, the contribution of each expert is decided by estimating speech intelligibility with a speech intelligibility detector (SID). We show that our proposed approach significantly reduces phone error rates across all severity stages in aphasic speech compared to a baseline approach that does not incorporate severity information into the modeling process."

However, in consideration of efficiency, a limited-size vocabulary that only contains the top-N highest frequency words are employed for model training, which leads to many rare and unknown words. It is rather difficult when translating from the low-resource and morphologically-rich agglutinative languages, which have complex morphology and large vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a morphological word segmentation method on the source-side for NMT that incorporates morphology knowledge to preserve the linguistic and semantic information in the word structure while reducing the vocabulary size at training time. It can be utilized as a preprocessing tool to segment the words in agglutinative languages for other natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Experimental results show that our morphologically motivated word segmentation method is better suitable for the NMT model, which achieves significant improvements on Turkish-English and Uyghur-Chinese machine translation tasks on account of reducing data sparseness and language complexity."

Past work has shown that domain knowledge, framed as constraints over the output space, can help improve predictive accuracy. However, designing good constraints often relies on domain expertise. In this paper, we study the problem of learning such constraints. We frame the problem as that of training a two-layer rectifier network to identify valid structures or substructures, and show a construction for converting a trained network into a system of linear constraints over the inference variables. Our experiments on several NLP tasks show that the learned constraints can improve the prediction accuracy, especially when the number of training examples is small."

Afterwards, we fuse the document-level and graph-level representations to perform joint training of content selection and question decoding. On the HotpotQA deep-question centric dataset, our model greatly improves performance over questions requiring reasoning over multiple facts, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

The checkpoint will enable recovering from any kind of failure, be it as localized as a process fault or as wide spread as power supply loss to an entire rack of machines. As we move towards Exascale computing, it is becoming clear that this kind of ""single-level"" checkpointing is too inefficient to scale. Some HPC researchers are now investigating multi-level checkpointing, where checkpoint operations at each level are tailored to specific kinds of failure to address the inefficiencies of single-level checkpointing. Multi-level checkpointing has been shown in practice to be superior, giving greater efficiency in operation over single-level checkpointing. However, to date there is no theoretical basis that provides optimal parameter settings for an interval-based coordinated multi-level checkpointing approach. This paper presents a theoretical framework for determining optimal parameter settings in an interval-based multi-level periodic checkpointing system, that is applicable to stream processing. Our approach is stochastic, where at a given checkpoint interval, a level is selected with some probability for checkpointing. We derive the optimal checkpoint interval and associated optimal checkpoint probabilities for a multi-level checkpointing system, that considers failure rates, checkpoint costs, restart costs and possible failure during restarting, at every level. We confirm our results with stochastic simulation and practical experimentation."

Proper evaluation metrics are like a beacon guiding the research of simile generation (SG). However, it remains under-explored as to what criteria should be considered, how to quantify each criterion into metrics, and whether the metrics are effective for comprehensive, efficient, and reliable SG evaluation. To address the issues, we establish HAUSER, a holistic and automatic evaluation system for the SG task, which consists of five criteria from three perspectives and automatic metrics for each criterion. Through extensive experiments, we verify that our metrics are significantly more correlated with human ratings from each perspective compared with prior automatic metrics."

Failure to update comments accordingly when the corresponding code is modified introduces inconsistencies, which is known to lead to confusion and software bugs. In this paper, we aim to detect whether a comment becomes inconsistent as a result of changes to the corresponding body of code, in order to catch potential inconsistencies just-in-time, i.e., before they are committed to a code base. To achieve this, we develop a deep-learning approach that learns to correlate a comment with code changes. By evaluating on a large corpus of comment/code pairs spanning various comment types, we show that our model outperforms multiple baselines by significant margins. For extrinsic evaluation, we show the usefulness of our approach by combining it with a comment update model to build a more comprehensive automatic comment maintenance system which can both detect and resolve inconsistent comments based on code changes."

As a result, such models are biased on position and often perform a smart selection of sentences from the beginning of the document. When summarizing long narratives, which have complex structure and present information piecemeal, simple position heuristics are not sufficient. In this paper, we propose to explicitly incorporate the underlying structure of narratives into general unsupervised and supervised extractive summarization models. We formalize narrative structure in terms of key narrative events (turning points) and treat it as latent in order to summarize screenplays (i.e., extract an optimal sequence of scenes). Experimental results on the CSI corpus of TV screenplays, which we augment with scene-level summarization labels, show that latent turning points correlate with important aspects of a CSI episode and improve summarization performance over general extractive algorithms leading to more complete and diverse summaries."

We particularly focus on the scene context provided by the visual information, to ground the ASR. We extract representations for audio features in the encoder layers of the transformer and fuse video features using an additional crossmodal multihead attention layer. Additionally, we incorporate a multitask training criterion for multiresolution ASR, where we train the model to generate both character and subword level transcriptions.   Experimental results on the How2 dataset, indicate that multiresolution training can speed up convergence by around 50% and relatively improves word error rate (WER) performance by upto 18% over subword prediction models.

Different from the general image captioning tasks, medical report generation is more challenging for data-driven neural models. This is mainly due to 1) the serious data bias: the normal visual regions dominate the dataset over the abnormal visual regions, and 2) the very long sequence. To alleviate above two problems, we propose an AlignTransformer framework, which includes the Align Hierarchical Attention (AHA) and the Multi-Grained Transformer (MGT) modules: 1) AHA module first predicts the disease tags from the input image and then learns the multi-grained visual features by hierarchically aligning the visual regions and disease tags. The acquired disease-grounded visual features can better represent the abnormal regions of the input image, which could alleviate data bias problem; 2) MGT module effectively uses the multi-grained features and Transformer framework to generate the long medical report. The experiments on the public IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets show that the AlignTransformer can achieve results competitive with state-of-the-art methods on the two datasets. Moreover, the human evaluation conducted by professional radiologists further proves the effectiveness of our approach."

Noncontextual word embeddings are an efficient alternative in these settings. Such methods typically use one vector to encode multiple different meanings of a word, and incur errors due to polysemy. This paper proposes a two-stage method to distill multiple word senses from a pre-trained language model (BERT) by using attention over the senses of a word in a context and transferring this sense information to fit multi-sense embeddings in a skip-gram-like framework. We demonstrate an effective approach to training the sense disambiguation mechanism in our model with a distribution over word senses extracted from the output layer embeddings of BERT. Experiments on the contextual word similarity and sense induction tasks show that this method is superior to or competitive with state-of-the-art multi-sense embeddings on multiple benchmark data sets, and experiments with an embedding-based topic model (ETM) demonstrates the benefits of using this multi-sense embedding in a downstream application."

Although several `toxicity' detection datasets and models have been published, most of them ignore the context of the posts, implicitly assuming that comments maybe judged independently. We investigate this assumption by focusing on two questions: (a) does context affect the human judgement, and (b) does conditioning on context improve performance of toxicity detection systems? We experiment with Wikipedia conversations, limiting the notion of context to the previous post in the thread and the discussion title. We find that context can both amplify or mitigate the perceived toxicity of posts. Moreover, a small but significant subset of manually labeled posts (5% in one of our experiments) end up having the opposite toxicity labels if the annotators are not provided with context. Surprisingly, we also find no evidence that context actually improves the performance of toxicity classifiers, having tried a range of classifiers and mechanisms to make them context aware. This points to the need for larger datasets of comments annotated in context. We make our code and data publicly available."

The traditional way of VRD is first to detect objects in an image and then separately predict the relationship between the detected object instances. Such a disjoint approach is prone to predict redundant relationship tags (i.e., predicate) between the same object pair with similar semantic meaning, or incorrect ones that have a similar meaning to the ground truth but are semantically incorrect. To remedy this, we propose to jointly train a VRD model with visual object features and semantic relationship features. To this end, we propose VReBERT, a BERT-like transformer model for Visual Relationship Detection with a multi-stage training strategy to jointly process visual and semantic features. We show that our simple BERT-like model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art VRD models in predicate prediction. Furthermore, we show that by using the pre-trained VReBERT model, our model pushes the state-of-the-art zero-shot predicate prediction by a significant margin (+8.49 R@50 and +8.99 R@100)."

This combines the statistical transparency of the probabilistic modelling framework with the representational power of deep learning. Yet, due to a problem known as posterior collapse, it is difficult to estimate such models in the context of language modelling effectively. We concentrate on one such model, the variational auto-encoder, which we argue is an important building block in hierarchical probabilistic models of language. This paper contributes a sober view of the problem, a survey of techniques to address it, novel techniques, and extensions to the model. To establish a ranking of techniques, we perform a systematic comparison using Bayesian optimisation and find that many techniques perform reasonably similar, given enough resources. Still, a favourite can be named based on convenience. We also make several empirical observations and recommendations of best practices that should help researchers interested in this exciting field."

Since replacement or recharging of batteries in sensor nodes is almost impossible, power consumption becomes one of the crucial design issues in WSN. Clustering algorithm plays an important role in power conservation for the energy constrained network. Choosing a cluster head can appropriately balance the load in the network thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing lifetime. The paper focuses on an efficient cluster head election scheme that rotates the cluster head position among the nodes with higher energy level as compared to other. The algorithm considers initial energy, residual energy and an optimum value of cluster heads to elect the next group of cluster heads for the network that suits for IoT applications such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, and systems. Simulation analysis shows the modified version performs better than the LEACH protocol by enhancing the throughput by 60%, lifetime by 66%, and residual energy by 64%."

We investigated the relationship between music production quality and musically induced and perceived emotions. A listening test was performed where 10 critical listeners and 10 non-critical listeners evaluated 10 songs. There were two mixes of each song, the low quality mix and the high quality mix. Each participant's subjective experience was measured directly through questionnaire and indirectly by examining peripheral physiological changes, change in facial expressions and the number of head nods and shakes they made as they listened to each mix. We showed that music production quality had more of an emotional impact on critical listeners. Also, critical listeners had significantly different emotional responses to non-critical listeners for the high quality mixes and to a lesser extent the low quality mixes. The findings suggest that having a high level of skill in mix engineering only seems to matter in an emotional context to a subset of music listeners."
525,acl,2020,Modelling Context and Syntactical Features for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.293,"We present a statistical parsing framework for sentence-level sentiment classification in this article. Unlike previous works that employ syntactic parsing results for sentiment analysis, we develop a statistical parser to directly analyze the sentiment structure of a sentence. We show that complicated phenomena in sentiment analysis (e.g., negation, intensification, and contrast) can be handled the same as simple and straightforward sentiment expressions in a unified and probabilistic way. We formulate the sentiment grammar upon Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), and provide a formal description of the sentiment parsing framework. We develop the parsing model to obtain possible sentiment parse trees for a sentence, from which the polarity model is proposed to derive the sentiment strength and polarity, and the ranking model is dedicated to selecting the best sentiment tree. We train the parser directly from examples of sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity labels but without any syntactic annotations or polarity annotations of constituents within sentences. Therefore we can obtain training data easily. In particular, we train a sentiment parser, s.parser, from a large amount of review sentences with users' ratings as rough sentiment polarity labels. Extensive experiments on existing benchmark datasets show significant improvements over baseline sentiment classification approaches."
526,acl,2020,Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.420,"Probes, supervised models trained to predict properties (like parts-of-speech) from representations (like ELMo), have achieved high accuracy on a range of linguistic tasks. But does this mean that the representations encode linguistic structure or just that the probe has learned the linguistic task? In this paper, we propose control tasks, which associate word types with random outputs, to complement linguistic tasks. By construction, these tasks can only be learned by the probe itself. So a good probe, (one that reflects the representation), should be selective, achieving high linguistic task accuracy and low control task accuracy. The selectivity of a probe puts linguistic task accuracy in context with the probe's capacity to memorize from word types. We construct control tasks for English part-of-speech tagging and dependency edge prediction, and show that popular probes on ELMo representations are not selective. We also find that dropout, commonly used to control probe complexity, is ineffective for improving selectivity of MLPs, but that other forms of regularization are effective. Finally, we find that while probes on the first layer of ELMo yield slightly better part-of-speech tagging accuracy than the second, probes on the second layer are substantially more selective, which raises the question of which layer better represents parts-of-speech."
527,acl,2020,Sentence Meta-Embeddings for Unsupervised Semantic Textual Similarity,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.628,"Unsupervised sentence embedding aims to obtain the most appropriate embedding for a sentence to reflect its semantic. Contrastive learning has been attracting developing attention. For a sentence, current models utilize diverse data augmentation methods to generate positive samples, while consider other independent sentences as negative samples. Then they adopt InfoNCE loss to pull the embeddings of positive pairs gathered, and push those of negative pairs scattered. Although these models have made great progress on sentence embedding, we argue that they may suffer from feature suppression. The models fail to distinguish and decouple textual similarity and semantic similarity. And they may overestimate the semantic similarity of any pairs with similar textual regardless of the actual semantic difference between them. This is because positive pairs in unsupervised contrastive learning come with similar and even the same textual through data augmentation. To alleviate feature suppression, we propose contrastive learning for unsupervised sentence embedding with soft negative samples (SNCSE). Soft negative samples share highly similar textual but have surely and apparently different semantic with the original samples. Specifically, we take the negation of original sentences as soft negative samples, and propose Bidirectional Margin Loss (BML) to introduce them into traditional contrastive learning framework, which merely involves positive and negative samples. Our experimental results show that SNCSE can obtain state-of-the-art performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) task with average Spearman's correlation coefficient of 78.97% on BERTbase and 79.23% on RoBERTabase. Besides, we adopt rank-based error analysis method to detect the weakness of SNCSE for future study."

529,acl,2020,How Accents Confound: Probing for Accent Information in End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.345,"Accent variability has posed a huge challenge to automatic speech recognition~(ASR) modeling. Although one-hot accent vector based adaptation systems are commonly used, they require prior knowledge about the target accent and cannot handle unseen accents. Furthermore, simply concatenating accent embeddings does not make good use of accent knowledge, which has limited improvements. In this work, we aim to tackle these problems with a novel layer-wise adaptation structure injected into the E2E ASR model encoder. The adapter layer encodes an arbitrary accent in the accent space and assists the ASR model in recognizing accented speech. Given an utterance, the adaptation structure extracts the corresponding accent information and transforms the input acoustic feature into an accent-related feature through the linear combination of all accent bases. We further explore the injection position of the adaptation layer, the number of accent bases, and different types of accent bases to achieve better accent adaptation. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptation structure brings 12\% and 10\% relative word error rate~(WER) reduction on the AESRC2020 accent dataset and the Librispeech dataset, respectively, compared to the baseline."

Could ordering the sublayers in a different pattern lead to better performance? We generate randomly ordered transformers and train them with the language modeling objective. We observe that some of these models are able to achieve better performance than the interleaved baseline, and that those successful variants tend to have more self-attention at the bottom and more feedforward sublayers at the top. We propose a new transformer pattern that adheres to this property, the sandwich transformer, and show that it improves perplexity on multiple word-level and character-level language modeling benchmarks, at no cost in parameters, memory, or training time. However, the sandwich reordering pattern does not guarantee performance gains across every task, as we demonstrate on machine translation models. Instead, we suggest that further exploration of task-specific sublayer reorderings is needed in order to unlock additional gains."

They combine the best of two worlds by modeling the majority of frequent words directly and at the same time allow open vocabulary speech recognition by backing off to shorter units or characters to construct words unseen during training. However, mapping text to subwords is ambiguous and often multiple segmentation variants are possible. Yet, many systems are trained using only the most likely segmentation. Recent research suggests that sampling subword segmentations during training acts as a regularizer for neural machine translation and speech recognition models, leading to performance improvements. In this work, we conduct a principled investigation on the regularizing effect of the subword segmentation sampling method for a streaming end-to-end speech recognition task. In particular, we evaluate the subword regularization contribution depending on the size of the training dataset. Our results suggest that subword regularization provides a consistent improvement of (2-8%) relative word-error-rate reduction, even in a large-scale setting with datasets up to a size of 20k hours. Further, we analyze the effect of subword regularization on recognition of unseen words and its implications on beam diversity."

However, it is unclear how the number of pretraining languages influences a model's zero-shot learning for languages unseen during pretraining. To fill this gap, we ask the following research questions: (1) How does the number of pretraining languages influence zero-shot performance on unseen target languages? (2) Does the answer to that question change with model adaptation? (3) Do the findings for our first question change if the languages used for pretraining are all related? Our experiments on pretraining with related languages indicate that choosing a diverse set of languages is crucial. Without model adaptation, surprisingly, increasing the number of pretraining languages yields better results up to adding related languages, after which performance plateaus. In contrast, with model adaptation via continued pretraining, pretraining on a larger number of languages often gives further improvement, suggesting that model adaptation is crucial to exploit additional pretraining languages."

In addition to yielding gains in predictive accuracy, attention weights are often claimed to confer interpretability, purportedly useful both for providing insights to practitioners and for explaining why a model makes its decisions to stakeholders. We call the latter use of attention mechanisms into question by demonstrating a simple method for training models to produce deceptive attention masks. Our method diminishes the total weight assigned to designated impermissible tokens, even when the models can be shown to nevertheless rely on these features to drive predictions. Across multiple models and tasks, our approach manipulates attention weights while paying surprisingly little cost in accuracy. Through a human study, we show that our manipulated attention-based explanations deceive people into thinking that predictions from a model biased against gender minorities do not rely on the gender. Consequently, our results cast doubt on attention's reliability as a tool for auditing algorithms in the context of fairness and accountability."

Text classification just makes up for these deficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization system called TCSum, which leverages plentiful text classification data to improve the performance of multi-document summarization. TCSum projects documents onto distributed representations which act as a bridge between text classification and summarization. It also utilizes the classification results to produce summaries of different styles. Extensive experiments on DUC generic multi-document summarization datasets show that, TCSum can achieve the state-of-the-art performance without using any hand-crafted features and has the capability to catch the variations of summary styles with respect to different text categories."

This results in a loss of generalizability, controllability and a data-hungry nature. Conversely, more traditional dialog systems do have strong models of explicit structure. This paper introduces several approaches for explicitly incorporating structure into neural models of dialog. Structured Fusion Networks first learn neural dialog modules corresponding to the structured components of traditional dialog systems and then incorporate these modules in a higher-level generative model. Structured Fusion Networks obtain strong results on the MultiWOZ dataset, both with and without reinforcement learning. Structured Fusion Networks are shown to have several valuable properties, including better domain generalizability, improved performance in reduced data scenarios and robustness to divergence during reinforcement learning."

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to enhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained edge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii) adaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available; and (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and energy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN adaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of the models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters. This paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of such techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge devices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In particular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with corruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN adaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other that also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA, Raspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only updates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU, to be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However, the adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results strongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient on-device DNN adaptation."

Fine-tuning the trained contextual models on task-specific datasets has been the key to achieving superior performance downstream. While fine-tuning these pre-trained models is straightforward for lexical applications (applications with only language modality), it is not trivial for multimodal language (a growing area in NLP focused on modeling face-to-face communication). Pre-trained models don't have the necessary components to accept two extra modalities of vision and acoustic. In this paper, we proposed an attachment to BERT and XLNet called Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG). MAG allows BERT and XLNet to accept multimodal nonverbal data during fine-tuning. It does so by generating a shift to internal representation of BERT and XLNet; a shift that is conditioned on the visual and acoustic modalities. In our experiments, we study the commonly used CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis. Fine-tuning MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet significantly boosts the sentiment analysis performance over previous baselines as well as language-only fine-tuning of BERT and XLNet. On the CMU-MOSI dataset, MAG-XLNet achieves human-level multimodal sentiment analysis performance for the first time in the NLP community."

Aiming to tackle this problem, the natural language processing (NLP) community has experimented with a range of techniques for abuse detection. While achieving substantial success, these methods have so far only focused on modelling the linguistic properties of the comments and the online communities of users, disregarding the emotional state of the users and how this might affect their language. The latter is, however, inextricably linked to abusive behaviour. In this paper, we present the first joint model of emotion and abusive language detection, experimenting in a multi-task learning framework that allows one task to inform the other. Our results demonstrate that incorporating affective features leads to significant improvements in abuse detection performance across datasets."

In this paper, first, we present a systematic approach for defining a physical scenario using a causal sequence of physical interactions between objects. Then, we propose a methodology for generating tasks in a physics-simulating environment using these defined scenarios as inputs. Our approach enables a better understanding of the granular mechanics required for solving physics-based tasks, thereby facilitating accurate evaluation of AI systems' physical reasoning capabilities. We demonstrate our proposed task generation methodology using the physics-based puzzle game Angry Birds and evaluate the generated tasks using a range of metrics, including physical stability, solvability using intended physical interactions, and accidental solvability using unintended solutions. We believe that the tasks generated using our proposed methodology can facilitate a nuanced evaluation of physical reasoning agents, thus paving the way for the development of agents for more sophisticated real-world applications."

This paper envisions the use of generative AI in transforming storytelling into an interactive drama using dynamic and immersive narratives. First, we describe scenarios where narratives are created and character conversations are designed within an overarching fantasy disposition.

We present Iterative Null-space Projection (INLP), a novel method for removing information from neural representations. Our method is based on repeated training of linear classifiers that predict a certain property we aim to remove, followed by projection of the representations on their null-space. By doing so, the classifiers become oblivious to that target property, making it hard to linearly separate the data according to it. While applicable for multiple uses, we evaluate our method on bias and fairness use-cases, and show that our method is able to mitigate bias in word embeddings, as well as to increase fairness in a setting of multi-class classification."

Most existing methods employ an encoder-decoder structure with a single encoder to learn acoustic representation and semantic information simultaneously, which ignores the speech-and-text modality differences and makes the encoder overloaded, leading to great difficulty in learning such a model. To address these issues, we propose a Speech-to-Text Adaptation for Speech Translation (STAST) model which aims to improve the end-to-end model performance by bridging the modality gap between speech and text. Specifically, we decouple the speech translation encoder into three parts and introduce a shrink mechanism to match the length of speech representation with that of the corresponding text transcription. To obtain better semantic representation, we completely integrate a text-based translation model into the STAST so that two tasks can be trained in the same latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-modal adaptation method to close the distance between speech and text representation. Experimental results on English-French and English-German speech translation corpora have shown that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance."

For this we introduce a two-step approach. In the first step, we generate first-order logic sentences which define some combinatorial objects, e.g., undirected graphs, permutations, matchings etc. In the second step, we use algorithms for lifted first-order model counting to generate integer sequences that count the objects encoded by the first-order logic formulas generated in the first step. For instance, if the first-order sentence defines permutations then the generated integer sequence is the sequence of factorial numbers $n!$. We demonstrate that our approach is able to generate interesting new sequences by showing that a non-negligible fraction of the automatically generated sequences can actually be found in the Online Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) while generating many other similar sequences which are not present in OEIS and which are potentially interesting. A key technical contribution of our work is the method for generation of first-order logic sentences which is able to drastically prune the space of sentences by discarding large fraction of sentences which would lead to redundant integer sequences."

Moreover, we use our improved SMT system to initialize a dual NMT model, which is further fine-tuned through on-the-fly back-translation. Together, we obtain large improvements over the previous state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine translation.

The structures of embedding spaces largely depend on the co-occurrence statistics of each word, which the choice of context window determines. Despite this obvious connection between the context window and mapping-based cross-lingual embeddings, their relationship has been underexplored in prior work. In this work, we provide a thorough evaluation, in various languages, domains, and tasks, of bilingual embeddings trained with different context windows. The highlight of our findings is that increasing the size of both the source and target window sizes improves the performance of bilingual lexicon induction, especially the performance on frequent nouns."

CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models. In a user study, a team responsible for a commercial sentiment analysis model found new and actionable bugs in an extensively tested model. In another user study, NLP practitioners with CheckList created twice as many tests, and found almost three times as many bugs as users without it."

To address this problem, we propose a method of ""soft gazetteers"" that incorporates ubiquitously available information from English knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia, into neural named entity recognition models through cross-lingual entity linking.

Motivated by this, we model translationese and original (i.e. natural) text as separate languages in a multilingual model, and pose the question: can we perform zero-shot translation between original source text and original target text? There is no data with original source and original target, so we train sentence-level classifiers to distinguish translationese from original target text, and use this classifier to tag the training data for an NMT model. Using this technique we bias the model to produce more natural outputs at test time, yielding gains in human evaluation scores on both accuracy and fluency. Additionally, we demonstrate that it is possible to bias the model to produce translationese and game the BLEU score, increasing it while decreasing human-rated quality. We analyze these models using metrics to measure the degree of translationese in the output, and present an analysis of the capriciousness of heuristically-based train-data tagging."
556,acl,2020,Predicting Depression in Screening Interviews from Latent Categorization of Interview Prompts,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.2,"In many centralized labor markets candidates interview with potential employers before matches are formed through a clearinghouse One prominent example is the market for medical residencies and fellowships, which in recent years has had a large increase in the number of interviews. There have been numerous efforts to reduce the cost of interviewing in these markets using a variety of signalling mechanisms, however, the theoretical properties of these mechanisms have not been systematically studied in models with rich preferences. In this paper we give theoretical guarantees for a variety of mechanisms, finding that these mechanisms must properly balance competition.   We consider a random market in which agents' latent preferences are based on observed qualities, personal taste and (ex post) interview shocks and assume that following an interview mechanism a final stable match is generated with respect to preferences over interview partners. We study a novel many-to-many interview match mechanism to coordinate interviews and that with relatively few interviews, when suitably designed, the interview match yields desirable properties.   We find that under the interview matching mechanism with a limit of $k$ interviews per candidate and per position, the fraction of positions that are unfilled vanishes quickly with $k$. Moreover the ex post efficiency grows rapidly with $k$, and reporting sincere pre-interview preferences to this mechanism is an $\epsilon$-Bayes Nash equilibrium. Finally, we compare the performance of the interview match to other signalling and coordination mechanisms from the literature."

We propose neural models that simulate the distributions of these response offsets, taking into account the response turn as well as the preceding turn. The models are designed to be integrated into the pipeline of an incremental spoken dialogue system (SDS). We evaluate our models using offline experiments as well as human listening tests. We show that human listeners consider certain response timings to be more natural based on the dialogue context. The introduction of these models into SDS pipelines could increase the perceived naturalness of interactions."

We employ a neural architecture comprising of convolutional and recurrent layers with the addition of an optional CRF layer at the top. This system participated in the open track of the Parseme shared task on automatic identification of verbal MWEs due to the use of pre-trained wikipedia word embeddings. It outperformed all participating systems in both open and closed tracks with the overall macro-average MWE-based F1 score of 58.09 averaged among all languages. A particular strength of the system is its superior performance on unseen data entries.

However, to control annotation cost, each instance in the crowdsourced data is typically annotated by a small number of annotators. This creates a sparsity issue and limits the quality of machine learning models trained on such data. In this paper, we study how to handle sparsity in crowdsourced data using data augmentation. Specifically, we propose to directly learn a classifier by augmenting the raw sparse annotations. We implement two principles of high-quality augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks: 1) the generated annotations should follow the distribution of authentic ones, which is measured by a discriminator; 2) the generated annotations should have high mutual information with the ground-truth labels, which is measured by an auxiliary network. Extensive experiments and comparisons against an array of state-of-the-art learning from crowds methods on three real-world datasets proved the effectiveness of our data augmentation framework. It shows the potential of our algorithm for low-budget crowdsourcing in general."

Most of the studies have focused on developing novels neural network architectures to deal with the hierarchical structure, but we prefer to look for efficient ways to strengthen a baseline model. We first define the task as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Afterwards, we propose an auxiliary synthetic task of bottom-up-classification. Then, from external dictionaries, we retrieve textual definitions for the classes of all the hierarchy's layers, and map them into the word vector space. We use the class-definition embeddings as an additional input to condition the prediction of the next layer and in an adapted beam search. Whereas the modified search did not provide large gains, the combination of the auxiliary task and the additional input of class-definitions significantly enhance the classification accuracy. With our efficient approaches, we outperform previous studies, using a drastically reduced number of parameters, in two well-known English datasets."

This limitation led to a resurgence of methods that model alignments between sentences and their corresponding meaning representations, either implicitly through latent variables or explicitly by taking advantage of alignment annotations. We take the second direction and propose TPOL, a two-step approach that first translates input sentences monotonically and then reorders them to obtain the correct output. This is achieved with a modular framework comprising a Translator and a Reorderer component. We test our approach on two popular semantic parsing datasets. Our experiments show that by means of the monotonic translations, TPOL can learn reliable lexico-logical patterns from aligned data, significantly improving compositional generalization both over conventional seq2seq models, as well as over other approaches that exploit gold alignments."

Such a fast pace of research would not be possible without general NLU benchmarks, which allow for a fair comparison of the proposed methods. However, such benchmarks are available only for a handful of languages. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a comprehensive multi-task benchmark for the Polish language understanding, accompanied by an online leaderboard. It consists of a diverse set of tasks, adopted from existing datasets for named entity recognition, question-answering, textual entailment, and others. We also introduce a new sentiment analysis task for the e-commerce domain, named Allegro Reviews (AR). To ensure a common evaluation scheme and promote models that generalize to different NLU tasks, the benchmark includes datasets from varying domains and applications. Additionally, we release HerBERT, a Transformer-based model trained specifically for the Polish language, which has the best average performance and obtains the best results for three out of nine tasks. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation, including several standard baselines and recently proposed, multilingual Transformer-based models."

Character substitution choices differ between users but have been shown to be governed by the same main principles observed across a variety of languages---namely, character pairs are often associated through phonetic or visual similarity. We propose a noisy-channel WFST cascade model for deciphering the original non-Latin script from observed romanized text in an unsupervised fashion. We train our model directly on romanized data from two languages: Egyptian Arabic and Russian. We demonstrate that adding inductive bias through phonetic and visual priors on character mappings substantially improves the model's performance on both languages, yielding results much closer to the supervised skyline. Finally, we introduce a new dataset of romanized Russian, collected from a Russian social network website and partially annotated for our experiments."

The most successful approaches to this task have typically explored explicit paths through sequences of triples. These approaches have usually resorted to human-designed sampling procedures, since large knowledge graphs produce prohibitively large numbers of possible paths, most of which are uninformative. As an alternative approach, we propose performing a single, short sequence of interactive lookup operations on an embedded knowledge graph which has been trained through end-to-end backpropagation to be an optimized and compressed version of the initial knowledge base. Our proposed model, called Embedded Knowledge Graph Network (EKGN), achieves new state-of-the-art results on popular knowledge base completion benchmarks."

The model can automatically acquire probabilistic discourse knowledge from a dialogue corpus were collected and annotated manually from multi-genre Egyptian call-centers. Extensive experiments were conducted using Support Vector Machines classifier to evaluate the system performance.

They struggle to achieve human-like thinking, however, because they lack the skill of iterative reasoning upon knowledge. To expose this problem in a new light, we introduce a challenge on learning from small data, PuzzLing Machines, which consists of Rosetta Stone puzzles from Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. These puzzles are carefully designed to contain only the minimal amount of parallel text necessary to deduce the form of unseen expressions. Solving them does not require external information (e.g., knowledge bases, visual signals) or linguistic expertise, but meta-linguistic awareness and deductive skills. Our challenge contains around 100 puzzles covering a wide range of linguistic phenomena from 81 languages. We show that both simple statistical algorithms and state-of-the-art deep neural models perform inadequately on this challenge, as expected. We hope that this benchmark, available at https://ukplab.github.io/PuzzLing-Machines/, inspires further efforts towards a new paradigm in NLP---one that is grounded in human-like reasoning and understanding."

However, for masked language models (MLMs), there is no direct way to estimate the log-likelihood of a sentence. To address this issue, Salazar et al. (2020) propose to estimate sentence pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores, computed by successively masking each sentence token, retrieving its score using the rest of the sentence as context, and summing the resulting values. Here, we demonstrate that the original PLL method yields inflated scores for out-of-vocabulary words and propose an adapted metric, in which we mask not only the target token, but also all within-word tokens to the right of the target. We show that our adapted metric (PLL-word-l2r) outperforms both the original PLL metric and a PLL metric in which all within-word tokens are masked. In particular, it better satisfies theoretical desiderata and better correlates with scores from autoregressive models. Finally, we show that the choice of metric affects even tightly controlled, minimal pair evaluation benchmarks (such as BLiMP), underscoring the importance of selecting an appropriate scoring metric for evaluating MLM properties."

In order to improve the quality of translations, it is important to exploit available resources efficiently. Employing different translation resources with different characteristics has many challenges. In this paper, we propose a method for exploiting available translation resources simultaneously. This method employs Learning to Rank(LTR) for exploiting different translation resources. To apply LTR methods for query translation, we define different translation relation based features in addition to context based features. We use the contextual information contained in translation resources for extracting context based features.The proposed method uses LTR to construct a translation ranking model based on defined features. The constructed model is used for ranking translation candidates of query words. To evaluate the proposed method we do English-Persian CLIR, in which we employ the translation ranking model to find translations of English queries and employ the translations to retrieve Persian documents. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms single resource based CLIR methods."

Their performance is often assumed to be superior, though in many conditions this is not yet the case. We compare cascaded and end-to-end models across high, medium, and low-resource conditions, and show that cascades remain stronger baselines. Further, we introduce two methods to incorporate phone features into ST models. We show that these features improve both architectures, closing the gap between end-to-end models and cascades, and outperforming previous academic work -- by up to 9 BLEU on our low-resource setting."

Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For example, given a statement that ""we shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women,"" most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker -- that ""women (candidates) are less qualified."" Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language.   We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups.   We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover Social Bias Frames from unstructured text. We find that while state-of-the-art neural models are effective at high-level categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias (80% F1), they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of Social Bias Frames. Our study motivates future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense reasoning on social implications."

Our brain is too complex to fully comprehend the structures and connectivity, as well as its functions, with the currently available technology such as electro-encephalography, positron emission tomography, or functional magnetic resonance imaging, and neurobiological data. Therefore, the exploration of neurobiological processes, such as cognition, requires substantially more related evidences, especially from in-vivo human experiments. Cognition and language are of inter-disciplinary nature and additional methodological support is needed from other disciplines, such as deep learning in the field of artificial intelligence, for example. In this paper, we have attempted to explain the neural mechanisms underlying ""cognition and language processing"" or ""cognition or thinking"" using a novel neural network model with several newly emerging developments such as neuronal resonance, in-vivo human fiber tractography or connectivity data, Engram and Hebbian hypothesis, human memory formation in the high brain areas, deep learning, and more recently developed neural memory concepts, the neural lexicon. The neural lexicon is developed via language by repeated exposure to the neural system, similar to multilayer signal processing in deep learning. We have derived a neural model to explain how human ""cognition and language processing"" or ""cognition and thinking"" works, with a focus on language, a universal medium of the human society. Although the proposed hypothesis is not fully based on experimental evidences, a substantial portion of the observations in this study is directly and indirectly supported by recent experimental findings and the theoretical bases of deep learning research."

With large-scale language models as the backbone, unsupervised pre-training on numerous corpora shows the potential to capture commonsense knowledge. Current pre-trained language model (PLM)-based reasoning follows the traditional practice using perplexity metric. However, commonsense reasoning is more than existing probability evaluation, which is biased by word frequency. This paper reconsiders the nature of commonsense reasoning and proposes a novel commonsense reasoning metric, Non-Replacement Confidence (NRC). In detail, it works on PLMs according to the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) pre-training objective in ELECTRA, in which the corruption detection objective reflects the confidence on contextual integrity that is more relevant to commonsense reasoning than existing probability. Our proposed novel method boosts zero-shot performance on two commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets and further seven commonsense question-answering datasets. Our analysis shows that pre-endowed commonsense knowledge, especially for RTD-based PLMs, is essential in downstream reasoning."

This paper proposes distributional semantic models which efficiently learn word embeddings for entailment, using a recently-proposed framework for modelling entailment in a vector-space. These models postulate a latent vector for a pseudo-phrase containing two neighbouring word vectors. We investigate both modelling words as the evidence they contribute about this phrase vector, or as the posterior distribution of a one-word phrase vector, and find that the posterior vectors perform better. The resulting word embeddings outperform the best previous results on predicting hyponymy between words, in unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments."

To evaluate systems properly via response selection, we propose the method to construct response selection test sets with well-chosen false candidates. Specifically, we propose to construct test sets filtering out some types of false candidates: (i) those unrelated to the ground-truth response and (ii) those acceptable as appropriate responses. Through experiments, we demonstrate that evaluating systems via response selection with the test sets developed by our method correlates more strongly with human evaluation, compared with widely used automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU."

In Neural Machine Translation (NMT) gender bias has been shown to reduce translation quality, particularly when the target language has grammatical gender. The recent WinoMT challenge set allows us to measure this effect directly (Stanovsky et al, 2019).   Ideally we would reduce system bias by simply debiasing all data prior to training, but achieving this effectively is itself a challenge. Rather than attempt to create a `balanced' dataset, we use transfer learning on a small set of trusted, gender-balanced examples. This approach gives strong and consistent improvements in gender debiasing with much less computational cost than training from scratch.   A known pitfall of transfer learning on new domains is `catastrophic forgetting', which we address both in adaptation and in inference. During adaptation we show that Elastic Weight Consolidation allows a performance trade-off between general translation quality and bias reduction. During inference we propose a lattice-rescoring scheme which outperforms all systems evaluated in Stanovsky et al (2019) on WinoMT with no degradation of general test set BLEU, and we show this scheme can be applied to remove gender bias in the output of `black box` online commercial MT systems.

Multiple works have proposed new network architectures or evaluation schemes, but potentially helpful context is still sometimes ignored by larger-context translation models. In this paper, we propose a novel learning algorithm that explicitly encourages a neural translation model to take into account additional context using a multilevel pair-wise ranking loss. We evaluate the proposed learning algorithm with a transformer-based larger-context translation system on document-level translation. By comparing performance using actual and random contexts, we show that a model trained with the proposed algorithm is more sensitive to the additional context."

A KG is a curated set of facts consisting of entities linked by relations. Certain facts include also temporal information forming a Temporal KG (TKG). Although many natural questions involve explicit or implicit time constraints, question answering (QA) over TKGs has been a relatively unexplored area. Existing solutions are mainly designed for simple temporal questions that can be answered directly by a single TKG fact. This paper puts forth a comprehensive embedding-based framework for answering complex questions over TKGs. Our method termed temporal question reasoning (TempoQR) exploits TKG embeddings to ground the question to the specific entities and time scope it refers to. It does so by augmenting the question embeddings with context, entity and time-aware information by employing three specialized modules. The first computes a textual representation of a given question, the second combines it with the entity embeddings for entities involved in the question, and the third generates question-specific time embeddings. Finally, a transformer-based encoder learns to fuse the generated temporal information with the question representation, which is used for answer predictions. Extensive experiments show that TempoQR improves accuracy by 25--45 percentage points on complex temporal questions over state-of-the-art approaches and it generalizes better to unseen question types."

Despite this success, Schick and Sch\""utze (2020) recently showed that these models struggle to understand rare words. For static word embeddings, this problem has been addressed by separately learning representations for rare words. In this work, we transfer this idea to pretrained language models: We introduce BERTRAM, a powerful architecture based on BERT that is capable of inferring high-quality embeddings for rare words that are suitable as input representations for deep language models. This is achieved by enabling the surface form and contexts of a word to interact with each other in a deep architecture. Integrating BERTRAM into BERT leads to large performance increases due to improved representations of rare and medium frequency words on both a rare word probing task and three downstream tasks."

For example, a state-of-the-art syntactic dependency parser trained on Wall Street Journal sentences has an absolute drop in performance of more than ten points when tested on textual data from the Web. An efficient solution to make these methods more robust to domain shift is to first learn a word representation using large amounts of unlabeled data from both domains, and then use this representation as features in a supervised learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose to use hidden Markov models to learn word representations for part-of-speech tagging. In particular, we study the influence of using data from the source, the target or both domains to learn the representation and the different ways to represent words using an HMM."

Recently, however, more advanced embedding methods and representations (e.g., ELMo, BERT) have further pushed the state-of-the-art in NLP, yet there are no common best practices for how to integrate these representations into clinical tasks. The purpose of this study, then, is to explore the space of possible options in utilizing these new models for clinical concept extraction, including comparing these to traditional word embedding methods (word2vec, GloVe, fastText). Both off-the-shelf open-domain embeddings and pre-trained clinical embeddings from MIMIC-III are evaluated. We explore a battery of embedding methods consisting of traditional word embeddings and contextual embeddings, and compare these on four concept extraction corpora: i2b2 2010, i2b2 2012, SemEval 2014, and SemEval 2015. We also analyze the impact of the pre-training time of a large language model like ELMo or BERT on the extraction performance. Last, we present an intuitive way to understand the semantic information encoded by contextual embeddings. Contextual embeddings pre-trained on a large clinical corpus achieves new state-of-the-art performances across all concept extraction tasks. The best-performing model outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with respective F1-measures of 90.25, 93.18 (partial), 80.74, and 81.65. We demonstrate the potential of contextual embeddings through the state-of-the-art performance these methods achieve on clinical concept extraction.

Our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the art for unsupervised sentence summarization according to ROUGE scores. Additionally, we demonstrate that the commonly reported ROUGE F1 metric is sensitive to summary length. Since this is unwillingly exploited in recent work, we emphasize that future evaluation should explicitly group summarization systems by output length brackets."

In this work, we explore to what extent neural network sentence encoders can learn to predict the strength of scalar inferences. We first show that an LSTM-based sentence encoder trained on an English dataset of human inference strength ratings is able to predict ratings with high accuracy (r=0.78). We then probe the model's behavior using manually constructed minimal sentence pairs and corpus data. We find that the model inferred previously established associations between linguistic features and inference strength, suggesting that the model learns to use linguistic features to predict pragmatic inferences."

Our cortical machinery segments the world and associate objects to specific colour terms, which is not only convenient for communication but also increases the efficiency of visual processing by reducing the dimensionality of input scenes. Although the neural substrate for this phenomenon is unknown, a recent study of cortical colour processing has discovered a set of neurons that are isoresponsive to stimuli in the shape of 3D-ellipsoidal surfaces in colour-opponent space. We hypothesise that these neurons might help explain the underlying mechanisms of colour naming in the visual cortex.   Following this, we propose a biologically-inspired colour naming model where each colour term - e.g. red, green, blue, yellow, etc. - is represented through an ellipsoid in 3D colour-opponent space. This paradigm is also supported by previous psychophysical colour categorisation experiments whose results resemble such shapes. ""Belongingness"" of each pixel to different colour categories is computed by a non-linear sigmoidal logistic function. The final colour term for a given pixel is calculated by a maximum pooling mechanism. The simplicity of our model allows its parameters to be learnt from a handful of segmented images. It also offers a straightforward extension to include further colour terms. Additionally, ellipsoids of proposed model can adapt to image contents offering a dynamical solution in order to address phenomenon of colour constancy. Our results on the Munsell chart and two datasets of real-world images show an overall improvement comparing to state-of-the-art algorithms."
586,acl,2020,The Right Tool for the Job: Matching Model and Instance Complexities,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.593,"We provide a comprehensive study of observable spectra from dark matter pair-annihilation or decay into sterile (right-handed) neutrinos. This occurs, for instance, in neutrino portal dark matter models, where a sterile neutrino acts as the portal between dark matter and the Standard Model sector. The subsequent decays of right-handed neutrinos produce detectable Standard Model particles, notably photons, positrons, and neutrinos. We study the phenomenology of models where the right-handed neutrino masses are below the GeV scale, as well as models where they are at, or significantly heavier than, the TeV scale. In both instances, and for different reasons, the standard tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, are both inadequate and inaccurate. We present the complete framework to compute the relevant branching ratios for right-handed neutrino decays and the spectra of secondary photons, positrons, and neutrinos for a broad range of dark matter and right-handed neutrino masses. We discuss the general features of such signals, and compare the spectra to standard signals from dark matter annihilation/decay into bottom quarks. Additionally, we provide open source code1 that can be used to compute such spectra. The code is available at https://github.com/LoganAMorrison/blackthorn."
587,acl,2020,Personalized PageRank with Syntagmatic Information for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-demos.6,"In this paper we concentrate on the resolution of the lexical ambiguity that arises when a given word has several different meanings. This specific task is commonly referred to as word sense disambiguation (WSD). The task of WSD consists of assigning the correct sense to words using an electronic dictionary as the source of word definitions. We present two WSD methods based on two main methodological approaches in this research area: a knowledge-based method and a corpus-based method. Our hypothesis is that word-sense disambiguation requires several knowledge sources in order to solve the semantic ambiguity of the words. These sources can be of different kinds--- for example, syntagmatic, paradigmatic or statistical information. Our approach combines various sources of knowledge, through combinations of the two WSD methods mentioned above. Mainly, the paper concentrates on how to combine these methods and sources of information in order to achieve good results in the disambiguation. Finally, this paper presents a comprehensive study and experimental work on evaluation of the methods and their combinations."

We define a set of rules enable us the passage from Arabizi to Arabic. Through these rules, we generate a set of candidates for the transliteration of each Arabizi word into arabic. Then, we extract the best candidate. This approach was evaluated by using three test corpora, and the obtained results show an improvement of the precision score which is equal to 75.11% for the best result. These results allow us to verify that our approach is very competitive comparing to others works that treat Arabizi transliteration in general.

589,acl,2020,BLEURT: Learning Robust Metrics for Text Generation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.704,"Evaluation metrics that are not robust to dialect variation make it impossible to tell how well systems perform for many groups of users, and can even penalize systems for producing text in lower-resource dialects. However, currently, there exists no way to quantify how metrics respond to change in the dialect of a generated utterance. We thus formalize dialect robustness and dialect awareness as goals for NLG evaluation metrics. We introduce a suite of methods and corresponding statistical tests one can use to assess metrics in light of the two goals. Applying the suite to current state-of-the-art metrics, we demonstrate that they are not dialect-robust and that semantic perturbations frequently lead to smaller decreases in a metric than the introduction of dialect features. As a first step to overcome this limitation, we propose a training schema, NANO, which introduces regional and language information to the pretraining process of a metric. We demonstrate that NANO provides a size-efficient way for models to improve the dialect robustness while simultaneously improving their performance on the standard metric benchmark."
590,acl,2020,Human Attention Maps for Text Classification: Do Humans and Neural Networks Focus on the Same Words?,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.419,"Attention mechanisms have been widely applied in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, as they help to focus on the area-of-interest of both visual and textual information. To answer the questions correctly, the model needs to selectively target different areas of an image, which suggests that an attention-based model may benefit from an explicit attention supervision. In this work, we aim to address the problem of adding attention supervision to VQA models. Since there is a lack of human attention data, we first propose a Human Attention Network (HAN) to generate human-like attention maps, training on a recently released dataset called Human ATtention Dataset (VQA-HAT). Then, we apply the pre-trained HAN on the VQA v2.0 dataset to automatically produce the human-like attention maps for all image-question pairs. The generated human-like attention map dataset for the VQA v2.0 dataset is named as Human-Like ATtention (HLAT) dataset. Finally, we apply human-like attention supervision to an attention-based VQA model. The experiments show that adding human-like supervision yields a more accurate attention together with a better performance, showing a promising future for human-like attention supervision in VQA."
591,acl,2020,Variational Neural Machine Translation with Normalizing Flows,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.694,"Variational Neural Machine Translation (VNMT) is an attractive framework for modeling the generation of target translations, conditioned not only on the source sentence but also on some latent random variables. The latent variable modeling may introduce useful statistical dependencies that can improve translation accuracy. Unfortunately, learning informative latent variables is non-trivial, as the latent space can be prohibitively large, and the latent codes are prone to be ignored by many translation models at training time. Previous works impose strong assumptions on the distribution of the latent code and limit the choice of the NMT architecture. In this paper, we propose to apply the VNMT framework to the state-of-the-art Transformer and introduce a more flexible approximate posterior based on normalizing flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal under both in-domain and out-of-domain conditions, significantly outperforming strong baselines."
592,acl,2020,That is a Known Lie: Detecting Previously Fact-Checked Claims,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.332,"The recent proliferation of ""fake news"" has triggered a number of responses, most notably the emergence of several manual fact-checking initiatives. As a result and over time, a large number of fact-checked claims have been accumulated, which increases the likelihood that a new claim in social media or a new statement by a politician might have already been fact-checked by some trusted fact-checking organization, as viral claims often come back after a while in social media, and politicians like to repeat their favorite statements, true or false, over and over again. As manual fact-checking is very time-consuming (and fully automatic fact-checking has credibility issues), it is important to try to save this effort and to avoid wasting time on claims that have already been fact-checked. Interestingly, despite the importance of the task, it has been largely ignored by the research community so far. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we formulate the task and we discuss how it relates to, but also differs from, previous work. We further create a specialized dataset, which we release to the research community. Finally, we present learning-to-rank experiments that demonstrate sizable improvements over state-of-the-art retrieval and textual similarity approaches."
593,acl,2020,Predictive Biases in Natural Language Processing Models: A Conceptual Framework and Overview,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.468,"An increasing number of works in natural language processing have addressed the effect of bias on the predicted outcomes, introducing mitigation techniques that act on different parts of the standard NLP pipeline (data and models). However, these works have been conducted in isolation, without a unifying framework to organize efforts within the field. This leads to repetitive approaches, and puts an undue focus on the effects of bias, rather than on their origins. Research focused on bias symptoms rather than the underlying origins could limit the development of effective countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a unifying conceptualization: the predictive bias framework for NLP. We summarize the NLP literature and propose a general mathematical definition of predictive bias in NLP along with a conceptual framework, differentiating four main origins of biases: label bias, selection bias, model overamplification, and semantic bias. We discuss how past work has countered each bias origin. Our framework serves to guide an introductory overview of predictive bias in NLP, integrating existing work into a single structure and opening avenues for future research."
594,acl,2020,Relation Extraction with Explanation,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.579,"Existing research studies on cross-sentence relation extraction in long-form multi-party conversations aim to improve relation extraction without considering the explainability of such methods. This work addresses that gap by focusing on extracting explanations that indicate that a relation exists while using only partially labeled data. We propose our model-agnostic framework, D-REX, a policy-guided semi-supervised algorithm that explains and ranks relations. We frame relation extraction as a re-ranking task and include relation- and entity-specific explanations as an intermediate step of the inference process. We find that about 90% of the time, human annotators prefer D-REX's explanations over a strong BERT-based joint relation extraction and explanation model. Finally, our evaluations on a dialogue relation extraction dataset show that our method is simple yet effective and achieves a state-of-the-art F1 score on relation extraction, improving upon existing methods by 13.5%."
595,acl,2020,"Two Birds, One Stone: A Simple, Unified Model for Text Generation from Structured and Unstructured Data",https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.355,"A number of researchers have recently questioned the necessity of increasingly complex neural network (NN) architectures. In particular, several recent papers have shown that simpler, properly tuned models are at least competitive across several NLP tasks. In this work, we show that this is also the case for text generation from structured and unstructured data. We consider neural table-to-text generation and neural question generation (NQG) tasks for text generation from structured and unstructured data, respectively. Table-to-text generation aims to generate a description based on a given table, and NQG is the task of generating a question from a given passage where the generated question can be answered by a certain sub-span of the passage using NN models. Experimental results demonstrate that a basic attention-based seq2seq model trained with the exponential moving average technique achieves the state of the art in both tasks.

596,acl,2020,A Contextual Hierarchical Attention Network with Adaptive Objective for Dialogue State Tracking,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.563,"Recent studies in dialogue state tracking (DST) leverage historical information to determine states which are generally represented as slot-value pairs. However, most of them have limitations to efficiently exploit relevant context due to the lack of a powerful mechanism for modeling interactions between the slot and the dialogue history. Besides, existing methods usually ignore the slot imbalance problem and treat all slots indiscriminately, which limits the learning of hard slots and eventually hurts overall performance. In this paper, we propose to enhance the DST through employing a contextual hierarchical attention network to not only discern relevant information at both word level and turn level but also learn contextual representations. We further propose an adaptive objective to alleviate the slot imbalance problem by dynamically adjust weights of different slots during training. Experimental results show that our approach reaches 52.68% and 58.55% joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets respectively and achieves new state-of-the-art performance with considerable improvements (+1.24% and +5.98%)."
