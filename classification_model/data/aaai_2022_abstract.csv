1,aaai,2022,Distributed Randomized Sketching Kernel Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i8.20870,"Differential privacy (DP) is a compelling privacy definition that explains the privacy-utility tradeoff via formal, provable guarantees. Inspired by recent progress toward general-purpose data release algorithms, we propose a private sketch, or small summary of the dataset, that supports a multitude of machine learning tasks including regression, classification, density estimation, near-neighbor search, and more. Our sketch consists of randomized contingency tables that are indexed with locality-sensitive hashing and constructed with an efficient one-pass algorithm. We prove competitive error bounds for DP kernel density estimation. Existing methods for DP kernel density estimation scale poorly, often exponentially slower with an increase in dimensions. In contrast, our sketch can quickly run on large, high-dimensional datasets in a single pass. Exhaustive experiments show that our generic sketch delivers a similar privacy-utility tradeoff when compared to existing DP methods at a fraction of the computation cost. We expect that our sketch will enable differential privacy in distributed, large-scale machine learning settings."
2,aaai,2022,Better Parameter-Free Stochastic Optimization with ODE Updates for Coin-Betting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20573,"Parameter-free stochastic gradient descent (PFSGD) algorithms do not require setting learning rates while achieving optimal theoretical performance. In practical applications, however, there remains an empirical gap between tuned stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and PFSGD. In this paper, we close the empirical gap with a new parameter-free algorithm based on continuous-time Coin-Betting on truncated models. The new update is derived through the solution of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and solved in a closed form. We show empirically that this new parameter-free algorithm outperforms algorithms with the ""best default"" learning rates and almost matches the performance of finely tuned baselines without anything to tune."
3,aaai,2022,Negative Sample Matters: A Renaissance of Metric Learning for Temporal Grounding,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i3.20163,"Temporal grounding aims to localize a video moment which is semantically aligned with a given natural language query. Existing methods typically apply a detection or regression pipeline on the fused representation with the research focus on designing complicated prediction heads or fusion strategies. Instead, from a perspective on temporal grounding as a metric-learning problem, we present a Mutual Matching Network (MMN), to directly model the similarity between language queries and video moments in a joint embedding space. This new metric-learning framework enables fully exploiting negative samples from two new aspects: constructing negative cross-modal pairs in a mutual matching scheme and mining negative pairs across different videos. These new negative samples could enhance the joint representation learning of two modalities via cross-modal mutual matching to maximize their mutual information. Experiments show that our MMN achieves highly competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on four video grounding benchmarks. Based on MMN, we present a winner solution for the HC-STVG challenge of the 3rd PIC workshop. This suggests that metric learning is still a promising method for temporal grounding via capturing the essential cross-modal correlation in a joint embedding space. Code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/MMN."
4,aaai,2022,Non-autoregressive Translation with Layer-Wise Prediction and Deep Supervision,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21323,"How do we perform efficient inference while retaining high translation quality? Existing neural machine translation models, such as Transformer, achieve high performance, but they decode words one by one, which is inefficient. Recent non-autoregressive translation models speed up the inference, but their quality is still inferior. In this work, we propose DSLP, a highly efficient and high-performance model for machine translation. The key insight is to train a non-autoregressive Transformer with Deep Supervision and feed additional Layer-wise Predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on four translation tasks (both directions of WMT'14 EN-DE and WMT'16 EN-RO). Results show that our approach consistently improves the BLEU scores compared with respective base models. Specifically, our best variant outperforms the autoregressive model on three translation tasks, while being 14.8 times more efficient in inference."
5,aaai,2022,Online Elicitation of Necessarily Optimal Matchings,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20451,"In this paper, we study the problem of eliciting preferences of agents in the house allocation model. For this we build on a recent model of Hosseini et al.[AAAI'21] and focus on the task of eliciting preferences to find matchings which are necessarily optimal, i.e., optimal under all possible completions of the elicited preferences. In particular, we follow the approach of Hosseini et al. and investigate the elicitation of necessarily Pareto optimal (NPO) and necessarily rank-maximal (NRM) matchings. Most importantly, we answer their open question and give an online algorithm for eliciting an NRM matching in the next-best query model which is 3/2-competitive, i.e., it takes at most 3/2 as many queries as an optimal algorithm. Besides this, we extend this field of research by introducing two new natural models of elicitation and by studying both the complexity of determining whether a necessarily optimal matching exists in them, and by giving online algorithms for these models."

In order to complete dialogues effectively, dialogue policy plays a key role in task-oriented dialogue systems. As far as we know, the existing task-oriented dialogue systems obtain the dialogue policy through classification, which can assign either a dialogue act and its corresponding parameters or multiple dialogue acts without their corresponding parameters for a dialogue action. In fact, a good dialogue policy should construct multiple dialogue acts and their corresponding parameters at the same time. However, it's hard for existing classification-based methods to achieve this goal. Thus, to address the issue above, we propose a novel generative dialogue policy learning method. Specifically, the proposed method uses attention mechanism to find relevant segments of given dialogue context and input utterance and then constructs the dialogue policy by a seq2seq way for task-oriented dialogue systems. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, we have publicly released our codes."
19,aaai,2022,Subspace Differential Privacy,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20315,"Many data applications have certain invariant constraints due to practical needs. Data curators who employ differential privacy need to respect such constraints on the sanitized data product as a primary utility requirement. Invariants challenge the formulation, implementation, and interpretation of privacy guarantees.   We propose subspace differential privacy, to honestly characterize the dependence of the sanitized output on confidential aspects of the data. We discuss two design frameworks that convert well-known differentially private mechanisms, such as the Gaussian and the Laplace mechanisms, to subspace differentially private ones that respect the invariants specified by the curator. For linear queries, we discuss the design of near-optimal mechanisms that minimize the mean squared error. Subspace differentially private mechanisms rid the need for post-processing due to invariants, preserve transparency and statistical intelligibility of the output, and can be suitable for distributed implementation. We showcase the proposed mechanisms on the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance demonstration data, and a spatio-temporal dataset of mobile access point connections on a large university campus."
20,aaai,2022,Machine-Learned Prediction Equilibrium for Dynamic Traffic Assignment,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20438,"User equilibrium is a central concept for studying transportation networks, and one can view it as the result of a dynamical process of drivers' route choice behavior. In this paper, based on a definition of O-D First-In-First-Out violation, we propose a new dynamical system model of the route choice behavior at the aggregate, route level for both static and dynamic transportation networks. An equilibrium of such a dynamical system can be a user equilibrium or a partial user equilibrium. We prove that, for static, symmetric traffic assignment problem with fixed or variable demand, only user equilibria are stable for the dynamical system, and the objective function in the mathematical programming formulation (Beckmann, McGuire, and Winsten, 1956) can be considered as the potential energy of the dynamical system. We then present an Euler-based perturbation method for finding user equilibrium and solve two examples for both static and dynamic traffic assignment problems. This new model is simple in form and could be applied to analyze other properties of transportation networks."
21,aaai,2022,Delivering Trustworthy AI through Formal XAI,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21499,"The advances in Machine Learning (ML) in recent years have been both impressive and far-reaching. However, the deployment of ML models is still impaired by a lack of trust in how the best-performing ML models make predictions. The issue of lack of trust is even more acute in the uses of ML models in high-risk or safety-critical domains. eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is at the core of ongoing efforts for delivering trustworthy AI. Unfortunately, XAI is riddled with critical misconceptions, that foster distrust instead of building trust. This paper details some of the most visible misconceptions in XAI, and shows how formal methods have been used, both to disprove those misconceptions, but also to devise practically effective alternatives."

23,aaai,2022,Online Search with Best-Price and Query-Based Predictions,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21199,"This paper leverages machine learned predictions to design online algorithms for the k-max and k-min search problems. Our algorithms can achieve performances competitive with the offline algorithm in hindsight when the predictions are accurate (i.e., consistency) and also provide worst-case guarantees when the predictions are arbitrarily wrong (i.e., robustness). Further, we show that our algorithms have attained the Pareto-optimal trade-off between consistency and robustness, where no other algorithms for k-max or k-min search can improve on the consistency for a given robustness. To demonstrate the performance of our algorithms, we evaluate them in experiments of buying and selling Bitcoin."
24,aaai,2022,Participatory Budgeting with Donations and Diversity Constraints,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21163,"Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic process where citizens jointly decide on how to allocate public funds to indivisible projects. This paper focuses on PB processes where citizens may give additional money to projects they want to see funded. We introduce a formal framework for this kind of PB with donations. Our framework also allows for diversity constraints, meaning that each project belongs to one or more types, and there are lower and upper bounds on the number of projects of the same type that can be funded. We propose three general classes of methods for aggregating the citizens' preferences in the presence of donations and analyze their axiomatic properties. Furthermore, we investigate the computational complexity of determining the outcome of a PB process with donations and of finding a citizen's optimal donation strategy."
25,aaai,2022,Contrastive Learning from Extremely Augmented Skeleton Sequences for Self-Supervised Action Recognition,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19957,"This paper strives for self-supervised learning of a feature space suitable for skeleton-based action recognition. Our proposal is built upon learning invariances to input skeleton representations and various skeleton augmentations via a noise contrastive estimation. In particular, we propose inter-skeleton contrastive learning, which learns from multiple different input skeleton representations in a cross-contrastive manner. In addition, we contribute several skeleton-specific spatial and temporal augmentations which further encourage the model to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of skeleton data. By learning similarities between different skeleton representations as well as augmented views of the same sequence, the network is encouraged to learn higher-level semantics of the skeleton data than when only using the augmented views. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for self-supervised learning from skeleton data on the challenging PKU and NTU datasets with multiple downstream tasks, including action recognition, action retrieval and semi-supervised learning. Code is available at https://github.com/fmthoker/skeleton-contrast."
26,aaai,2022,A First Mathematical Runtime Analysis of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21283,"The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is the most intensively used multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) in real-world applications. However, in contrast to several simple MOEAs analyzed also via mathematical means, no such study exists for the NSGA-II so far. In this work, we show that mathematical runtime analyses are feasible also for the NSGA-II. As particular results, we prove that with a population size four times larger than the size of the Pareto front, the NSGA-II with two classic mutation operators and four different ways to select the parents satisfies the same asymptotic runtime guarantees as the SEMO and GSEMO algorithms on the basic OneMinMax and LeadingOnesTrailingZeros benchmarks. However, if the population size is only equal to the size of the Pareto front, then the NSGA-II cannot efficiently compute the full Pareto front: for an exponential number of iterations, the population will always miss a constant fraction of the Pareto front. Our experiments confirm the above findings."
27,aaai,2022,RareGAN: Generating Samples for Rare Classes,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20715,"We study the problem of learning generative adversarial networks (GANs) for a rare class of an unlabeled dataset subject to a labeling budget. This problem is motivated from practical applications in domains including security (e.g., synthesizing packets for DNS amplification attacks), systems and networking (e.g., synthesizing workloads that trigger high resource usage), and machine learning (e.g., generating images from a rare class). Existing approaches are unsuitable, either requiring fully-labeled datasets or sacrificing the fidelity of the rare class for that of the common classes. We propose RareGAN, a novel synthesis of three key ideas: (1) extending conditional GANs to use labelled and unlabelled data for better generalization; (2) an active learning approach that requests the most useful labels; and (3) a weighted loss function to favor learning the rare class. We show that RareGAN achieves a better fidelity-diversity tradeoff on the rare class than prior work across different applications, budgets, rare class fractions, GAN losses, and architectures."
28,aaai,2022,Planning with Biological Neurons and Synapses,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19875,"There is evidence that biological synapses have only a fixed number of discrete weight states. Memory storage with such synapses behaves quite differently from synapses with unbounded, continuous weights as old memories are automatically overwritten by new memories. We calculate the storage capacity of discrete, bounded synapses in terms of Shannon information. For optimal learning rules, we investigate how information storage depends on the number of synapses, the number of synaptic states and the coding sparseness."
29,aaai,2022,DiPS: Differentiable Policy for Sketching in Recommender Systems,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20625,"In sequential recommender system applications, it is important to develop models that can capture users' evolving interest over time to successfully recommend future items that they are likely to interact with. For users with long histories, typical models based on recurrent neural networks tend to forget important items in the distant past. Recent works have shown that storing a small sketch of past items can improve sequential recommendation tasks. However, these works all rely on static sketching policies, i.e., heuristics to select items to keep in the sketch, which are not necessarily optimal and cannot improve over time with more training data. In this paper, we propose a differentiable policy for sketching (DiPS), a framework that learns a data-driven sketching policy in an end-to-end manner together with the recommender system model to explicitly maximize recommendation quality in the future. We also propose an approximate estimator of the gradient for optimizing the sketching algorithm parameters that is computationally efficient. We verify the effectiveness of DiPS on real-world datasets under various practical settings and show that it requires up to $50\%$ fewer sketch items to reach the same predictive quality than existing sketching policies."
30,aaai,2022,Anatomizing Bias in Facial Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21500,"Existing facial analysis systems have been shown to yield biased results against certain demographic subgroups. Due to its impact on society, it has become imperative to ensure that these systems do not discriminate based on gender, identity, or skin tone of individuals. This has led to research in the identification and mitigation of bias in AI systems. In this paper, we encapsulate bias detection/estimation and mitigation algorithms for facial analysis. Our main contributions include a systematic review of algorithms proposed for understanding bias, along with a taxonomy and extensive overview of existing bias mitigation algorithms. We also discuss open challenges in the field of biased facial analysis."
31,aaai,2022,An Interactive Explanatory AI System for Industrial Quality Control,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21530,"Machine learning based image classification algorithms, such as deep neural network approaches, will be increasingly employed in critical settings such as quality control in industry, where transparency and comprehensibility of decisions are crucial. Therefore, we aim to extend the defect detection task towards an interactive human-in-the-loop approach that allows us to integrate rich background knowledge and the inference of complex relationships going beyond traditional purely data-driven approaches. We propose an approach for an interactive support system for classifications in an industrial quality control setting that combines the advantages of both (explainable) knowledge-driven and data-driven machine learning methods, in particular inductive logic programming and convolutional neural networks, with human expertise and control. The resulting system can assist domain experts with decisions, provide transparent explanations for results, and integrate feedback from users; thus reducing workload for humans while both respecting their expertise and without removing their agency or accountability."
32,aaai,2022,Pushing the Limits of Rule Reasoning in Transformers through Natural Language Satisfiability,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21371,"Investigating the reasoning abilities of transformer models, and discovering new challenging tasks for them, has been a topic of much interest. Recent studies have found these models to be surprisingly strong at performing deductive reasoning over formal logical theories expressed in natural language. A shortcoming of these studies, however, is that they do not take into account that logical theories, when sampled uniformly at random, do not necessarily lead to hard instances. We propose a new methodology for creating challenging algorithmic reasoning datasets that focus on natural language satisfiability (NLSat) problems. The key idea is to draw insights from empirical sampling of hard propositional SAT problems and from complexity-theoretic studies of language. This methodology allows us to distinguish easy from hard instances, and to systematically increase the complexity of existing reasoning benchmarks such as RuleTaker. We find that current transformers, given sufficient training data, are surprisingly robust at solving the resulting NLSat problems of substantially increased difficulty. They also exhibit some degree of scale-invariance - the ability to generalize to problems of larger size and scope. Our results, however, reveal important limitations too: a careful sampling of training data is crucial for building models that generalize to larger problems, and transformer models' limited scale-invariance suggests they are far from learning robust deductive reasoning algorithms."
33,aaai,2022,Bounding Quality in Diverse Planning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21216,"Diverse, top-k, and top-quality planning are concerned with the generation of sets of solutions to sequential decision problems. Previously this area has been the domain of classical planners that require a symbolic model of the problem instance. This paper proposes a novel alternative approach that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), enabling application to problems for which only a black-box simulation model is available. We present a procedure for extracting bounded sets of plans from pre-generated search trees in best-first order, and a metric for evaluating the relative quality of paths through a search tree. We demonstrate this approach on a path-planning problem with hidden information, and suggest adaptations to the MCTS algorithm to increase the diversity of generated plans. Our results show that our method can generate diverse and high-quality plan sets in domains where classical planners are not applicable."
34,aaai,2022,Equity Promotion in Online Resource Allocation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21234,"We consider online resource allocation under a typical non-profit setting, where limited or even scarce resources are administered by a not-for-profit organization like a government. We focus on the internal-equity by assuming that arriving requesters are homogeneous in terms of their external factors like demands but heterogeneous for their internal attributes like demographics. Specifically, we associate each arriving requester with one or several groups based on their demographics (i.e., race, gender, and age), and we aim to design an equitable distributing strategy such that every group of requesters can receive a fair share of resources proportional to a preset target ratio. We present two LP-based sampling algorithms and investigate them both theoretically (in terms of competitive-ratio analysis) and experimentally based on real COVID-19 vaccination data maintained by the Minnesota Department of Health. Both theoretical and numerical results show that our LP-based sampling strategies can effectively promote equity, especially when the arrival population is disproportionately represented, as observed in the early stage of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout."
35,aaai,2022,Interventional Multi-Instance Learning with Deconfounded Instance-Level Prediction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20051,"The goal of recommendation is to show users items that they will like. Though usually framed as a prediction, the spirit of recommendation is to answer an interventional question---for each user and movie, what would the rating be if we ""forced"" the user to watch the movie? To this end, we develop a causal approach to recommendation, one where watching a movie is a ""treatment"" and a user's rating is an ""outcome."" The problem is there may be unobserved confounders, variables that affect both which movies the users watch and how they rate them; unobserved confounders impede causal predictions with observational data. To solve this problem, we develop the deconfounded recommender, a way to use classical recommendation models for causal recommendation. Following Wang & Blei [23], the deconfounded recommender involves two probabilistic models. The first models which movies the users watch; it provides a substitute for the unobserved confounders. The second one models how each user rates each movie; it employs the substitute to help account for confounders. This two-stage approach removes bias due to confounding. It improves recommendation and enjoys stable performance against interventions on test sets."
36,aaai,2022,Heterogeneous Peer Effects in the Linear Threshold Model,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20336,"The Linear Threshold Model is a widely used model that describes how information diffuses through a social network. According to this model, an individual adopts an idea or product after the proportion of their neighbors who have adopted it reaches a certain threshold. Typical applications of the Linear Threshold Model assume that thresholds are either the same for all network nodes or randomly distributed, even though some people may be more susceptible to peer pressure than others. To address individual-level differences, we propose causal inference methods for estimating individual thresholds that can more accurately predict whether and when individuals will be affected by their peers. We introduce the concept of heterogeneous peer effects and develop a Structural Causal Model which corresponds to the Linear Threshold Model and supports heterogeneous peer effect identification and estimation. We develop two algorithms for individual threshold estimation, one based on causal trees and one based on causal meta-learners. Our experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed models can better predict individual-level thresholds in the Linear Threshold Model and thus more precisely predict which nodes will get activated over time."
37,aaai,2022,Deep Amortized Relational Model with Group-Wise Hierarchical Generative Process,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20720,"We introduce the variational filtering EM algorithm, a simple, general-purpose method for performing variational inference in dynamical latent variable models using information from only past and present variables, i.e. filtering. The algorithm is derived from the variational objective in the filtering setting and consists of an optimization procedure at each time step. By performing each inference optimization procedure with an iterative amortized inference model, we obtain a computationally efficient implementation of the algorithm, which we call amortized variational filtering. We present experiments demonstrating that this general-purpose method improves performance across several deep dynamical latent variable models."
38,aaai,2022,Balanced Self-Paced Learning for AUC Maximization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20632,"Learning to improve AUC performance is an important topic in machine learning. However, AUC maximization algorithms may decrease generalization performance due to the noisy data. Self-paced learning is an effective method for handling noisy data. However, existing self-paced learning methods are limited to pointwise learning, while AUC maximization is a pairwise learning problem. To solve this challenging problem, we innovatively propose a balanced self-paced AUC maximization algorithm (BSPAUC). Specifically, we first provide a statistical objective for self-paced AUC. Based on this, we propose our self-paced AUC maximization formulation, where a novel balanced self-paced regularization term is embedded to ensure that the selected positive and negative samples have proper proportions. Specially, the sub-problem with respect to all weight variables may be non-convex in our formulation, while the one is normally convex in existing self-paced problems. To address this, we propose a doubly cyclic block coordinate descent method. More importantly, we prove that the sub-problem with respect to all weight variables converges to a stationary point on the basis of closed-form solutions, and our BSPAUC converges to a stationary point of our fixed optimization objective under a mild assumption. Considering both the deep learning and kernel-based implementations, experimental results on several large-scale datasets demonstrate that our BSPAUC has a better generalization performance than existing state-of-the-art AUC maximization methods."

Solving riddle is a challenging task for both machine and human, testing the capability of understanding figurative, creative natural language and reasoning with commonsense knowledge. We introduce BiRdQA, a bilingual multiple-choice question answering dataset with 6614 English riddles and 8751 Chinese riddles. For each riddle-answer pair, we provide four distractors with additional information from Wikipedia. The distractors are automatically generated at scale with minimal bias. Existing monolingual and multilingual QA models fail to perform well on our dataset, indicating that there is a long way to go before machine can beat human on solving tricky riddles. The dataset has been released to the community."
40,aaai,2022,Generalizing Reinforcement Learning through Fusing Self-Supervised Learning into Intrinsic Motivation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i8.20847,"A key challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) consists of learning in environments with sparse extrinsic rewards. In contrast to current RL methods, humans are able to learn new skills with little or no reward by using various forms of intrinsic motivation. We propose AMIGo, a novel agent incorporating -- as form of meta-learning -- a goal-generating teacher that proposes Adversarially Motivated Intrinsic Goals to train a goal-conditioned ""student"" policy in the absence of (or alongside) environment reward. Specifically, through a simple but effective ""constructively adversarial"" objective, the teacher learns to propose increasingly challenging -- yet achievable -- goals that allow the student to learn general skills for acting in a new environment, independent of the task to be solved. We show that our method generates a natural curriculum of self-proposed goals which ultimately allows the agent to solve challenging procedurally-generated tasks where other forms of intrinsic motivation and state-of-the-art RL methods fail."
41,aaai,2022,Online Enhanced Semantic Hashing: Towards Effective and Efficient Retrieval for Streaming Multi-Modal Data,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20346,"With the vigorous development of multimedia equipment and applications, efficient retrieval of large-scale multi-modal data has become a trendy research topic. Thereinto, hashing has become a prevalent choice due to its retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. Although multi-modal hashing has drawn lots of attention in recent years, there still remain some problems. The first point is that existing methods are mainly designed in batch mode and not able to efficiently handle streaming multi-modal data. The second point is that all existing online multi-modal hashing methods fail to effectively handle unseen new classes which come continuously with streaming data chunks. In this paper, we propose a new model, termed Online enhAnced SemantIc haShing (OASIS). We design novel semantic-enhanced representation for data, which could help handle the new coming classes, and thereby construct the enhanced semantic objective function. An efficient and effective discrete online optimization algorithm is further proposed for OASIS. Extensive experiments show that our method can exceed the state-of-the-art models. For good reproducibility and benefiting the community, our code and data are already available in supplementary material and will be made publicly available."
42,aaai,2022,A GNN-RNN Approach for Harnessing Geospatial and Temporal Information: Application to Crop Yield Prediction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21444,"Climate change is posing new challenges to crop-related concerns including food insecurity, supply stability and economic planning. As one of the central challenges, crop yield prediction has become a pressing task in the machine learning field. Despite its importance, the prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on various factors such as weather, land surface, soil quality as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts the crop yields at county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation for the comparison with other machine learning baselines by applying well-known linear models, tree-based models, deep learning methods and comparing their performance. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information."
43,aaai,2022,Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Traffic Forecasting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20587,"Traffic forecasting is one of the most popular spatio-temporal tasks in the field of machine learning. A prevalent approach in the field is to combine graph convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks for the spatio-temporal processing. There has been fierce competition and many novel methods have been proposed. In this paper, we present the method of spatio-temporal graph neural controlled differential equation (STG-NCDE). Neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are a breakthrough concept for processing sequential data. We extend the concept and design two NCDEs: one for the temporal processing and the other for the spatial processing. After that, we combine them into a single framework. We conduct experiments with 6 benchmark datasets and 20 baselines. STG-NCDE shows the best accuracy in all cases, outperforming all those 20 baselines by non-trivial margins."
44,aaai,2022,Semantic-Aware Representation Blending for Multi-Label Image Recognition with Partial Labels,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20105,"Training the multi-label image recognition models with partial labels, in which merely some labels are known while others are unknown for each image, is a considerably challenging and practical task. To address this task, current algorithms mainly depend on pre-training classification or similarity models to generate pseudo labels for the unknown labels. However, these algorithms depend on sufficient multi-label annotations to train the models, leading to poor performance especially with low known label proportion. In this work, we propose to blend category-specific representation across different images to transfer information of known labels to complement unknown labels, which can get rid of pre-training models and thus does not depend on sufficient annotations. To this end, we design a unified semantic-aware representation blending (SARB) framework that exploits instance-level and prototype-level semantic representation to complement unknown labels by two complementary modules: 1) an instance-level representation blending (ILRB) module blends the representations of the known labels in an image to the representations of the unknown labels in another image to complement these unknown labels. 2) a prototype-level representation blending (PLRB) module learns more stable representation prototypes for each category and blends the representation of unknown labels with the prototypes of corresponding labels to complement these labels. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO, Visual Genome, Pascal VOC 2007 datasets show that the proposed SARB framework obtains superior performance over current leading competitors on all known label proportion settings, i.e., with the mAP improvement of 4.6%, 4.%, 2.2% on these three datasets when the known label proportion is 10%.

Although a plethora of work has been done in enforcing various structural constraints by incorporating multiple losses utilising smoothness, left-right consistency, regularisation and matching surface normals, a few of them take into consideration multi-scale structures present in real world images. Most works utilise a VGG16 or ResNet50 model pre-trained on ImageNet weights for predicting depth. We propose a deep feature fusion method utilising features at multiple scales for learning self-supervised depth from scratch. Our fusion network selects features from both upper and lower levels at every level in the encoder network, thereby creating multiple feature pyramid sub-networks that are fed to the decoder after applying the CoordConv solution. We also propose a refinement module learning higher scale residual depth from a combination of higher level deep features and lower level residual depth using a pixel shuffling framework that super-resolves lower level residual depth. We select the KITTI dataset for evaluation and show that our proposed architecture can produce better or comparable results in depth prediction."

This paper introduces Forest Monkey (FM), a toolkit designed to reason the outputs of any AI-based defect detection and/or classification model with data explainability. Implemented as a Python package, FM takes input in the form of dataset folder paths (including original images, ground truth labels, and predicted labels) and provides a set of charts and a text file to illustrate the reasoning results and suggest possible improvements. The FM toolkit consists of processes such as feature extraction from predictions to reasoning targets, feature extraction from images to defect characteristics, and a decision tree-based AI-Reasoner. Additionally, this paper investigates the time performance of the FM toolkit when applied to four AI models with different datasets. Lastly, a tutorial is provided to guide users in performing reasoning tasks using the FM toolkit."

In order to adapt to novel zero-shot tasks, our meta-learner learns from the model parameters of known tasks (with ground truth) and the correlation of known tasks to zero-shot tasks. Such intuition finds its foothold in cognitive science, where a subject (human baby) can adapt to a novel-concept (depth understanding) by correlating it with old concepts (hand movement or self-motion), without receiving explicit supervision. We evaluated our model on the Taskonomy dataset, with four tasks as zero-shot: surface-normal, room layout, depth, and camera pose estimation. These tasks were chosen based on the data acquisition complexity and the complexity associated with the learning process using a deep network. Our proposed methodology out-performs state-of-the-art models (which use ground truth)on each of our zero-shot tasks, showing promise on zero-shot task transfer. We also conducted extensive experiments to study the various choices of our methodology, as well as showed how the proposed method can also be used in transfer learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstsuch effort on zero-shot learning in the task space."

Lack of proper planning and management may cause the encroachment of urban fabrics into reserved or special regions which in turn can lead to an unsustainable increase in population. Ineffective management and planning generally leads to depreciated standard of living, where physical hazards like traffic accidents and disease vector breeding become prevalent. In order to support urban planners and policy makers in effective planning and accurate decision making, we investigate urban land-use in sub-Saharan Africa. Land-use dynamics serves as a crucial parameter in current strategies and policies for natural resource management and monitoring. Focusing on Nairobi, we use an efficient deep learning approach with patch-based prediction to classify regions based on land-use from 2004 to 2018 on a quarterly basis. We estimate changes in land-use within this period, and using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, our results forecast land-use for a given future date. Furthermore, we provide labelled land-use maps which will be helpful to urban planners."

Previous studies build scene-centric representations that do not consider the significant variation among outdoor instances and thus lack the flexibility and functionalities that an instance-level model can offer. We build such an instance-level model by formulating and tackling a local update problem, i.e., how to predict a refined update given an initial 3D cuboid guess. We demonstrate how solving this problem can complement scene-centric approaches in (i) building a coarse-to-fine multi-resolution system, (ii) performing model-agnostic object location refinement, and (iii) conducting stereo 3D tracking-by-detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.

Unfortunately, online or dynamic algorithms which use these embeddings seem inherently randomized and ill-suited against adaptive adversaries.   In this paper we provide a new tree embedding which addresses these issues by deterministically embedding a graph into a single tree containing $O(\log n)$ copies of each vertex while preserving the connectivity structure of every subgraph and $O(\log^2 n)$-approximating the cost of every subgraph.   Using this embedding we obtain several new algorithmic results: We reduce an open question of Alon et al. [SODA 2004] -- the existence of a deterministic poly-log-competitive algorithm for online group Steiner tree on a general graph -- to its tree case. We give a poly-log-competitive deterministic algorithm for a closely related problem -- online partial group Steiner tree -- which, roughly, is a bicriteria version of online group Steiner tree. Lastly, we give the first poly-log approximations for demand-robust Steiner forest, group Steiner tree and group Steiner forest."
51,aaai,2022,AI for Disaster Rapid Damage Assessment from Microblogs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21521,"This study aims to enable more reliable automated post-disaster building damage classification using artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-view imagery. The current practices and research efforts in adopting AI for post-disaster damage assessment are generally (a) qualitative, lacking refined classification of building damage levels based on standard damage scales, and (b) trained based on aerial or satellite imagery with limited views, which, although indicative, are not completely descriptive of the damage scale. To enable more accurate and reliable automated quantification of damage levels, the present study proposes the use of more comprehensive visual data in the form of multiple ground and aerial views of the buildings. To have such a spatially-aware damage prediction model, a Multi-view Convolution Neural Network (MV-CNN) architecture is used that combines the information from different views of a damaged building. This spatial 3D context damage information will result in more accurate identification of damages and reliable quantification of damage levels. The proposed model is trained and validated on reconnaissance visual dataset containing expert-labeled, geotagged images of the inspected buildings following hurricane Harvey. The developed model demonstrates reasonably good accuracy in predicting the damage levels and can be used to support more informed and reliable AI-assisted disaster management practices."

Most assume availability of the class label, which is impractical in many real-world applications such as precision medicine, actuarial analysis and recidivism prediction. Here we consider fairness in longitudinal right-censored environments, where the time to event might be unknown, resulting in censorship of the class label and inapplicability of existing fairness studies. We devise applicable fairness measures, propose a debiasing algorithm, and provide necessary theoretical constructs to bridge fairness with and without censorship for these important and socially-sensitive tasks. Our experiments on four censored datasets confirm the utility of our approach."

As the services provided by e-commerce platforms become diverse, it is necessary to dynamically adapt the patterns of descriptions generated. The selling point of products is an important type of product description for which the length should be as short as possible while still conveying key information. In addition, this kind of product description should be eye-catching to the readers. Currently, product selling points are normally written by human experts. Thus, the creation and maintenance of these contents incur high costs. These costs can be significantly reduced if product selling points can be automatically generated by machines. In this paper, we report our experience developing and deploying the Intelligent Online Selling Point Extraction (IOSPE) system to serve the recommendation system in the JD.com e-commerce platform. Since July 2020, IOSPE has become a core service for 62 key categories of products (covering more than 4 million products). So far, it has generated more than 0.1 billion selling points, thereby significantly scaling up the selling point creation operation and saving human labour. These IOSPE generated selling points have increased the click-through rate (CTR) by 1.89\% and the average duration the customers spent on the products by more than 2.03\% compared to the previous practice, which are significant improvements for such a large-scale e-commerce platform."
54,aaai,2022,Reducing Flipping Errors in Deep Neural Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20603,"We study the trade-offs between storage/bandwidth and prediction accuracy of neural networks that are stored in noisy media. Conventionally, it is assumed that all parameters (e.g., weight and biases) of a trained neural network are stored as binary arrays and are error-free. This assumption is based upon the implementation of error correction codes (ECCs) that correct potential bit flips in storage media. However, ECCs add storage overhead and cause bandwidth reduction when loading the trained parameters during the inference. We study the robustness of deep neural networks when bit errors exist but ECCs are turned off for different neural network models and datasets. It is observed that more sophisticated models and datasets are more vulnerable to errors in their trained parameters. We propose a simple detection approach that can universally improve the robustness, which in some cases can be improved by orders of magnitude. We also propose an alternative binary representation of the parameters such that the distortion brought by bit flips is reduced and even theoretically vanishing when the number of bits to represent a parameter increases."

Joint tracking and segmentation have been attempted in some studies but they often lack full compatibility of both box and mask in initialization and prediction, and mainly focus on single-object scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Multi-object Mask-box Integrated framework for unified Tracking and Segmentation, dubbed MITS. Firstly, the unified identification module is proposed to support both box and mask reference for initialization, where detailed object information is inferred from boxes or directly retained from masks. Additionally, a novel pinpoint box predictor is proposed for accurate multi-object box prediction, facilitating target-oriented representation learning. All target objects are processed simultaneously from encoding to propagation and decoding, as a unified pipeline for VOT and VOS. Experimental results show MITS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both VOT and VOS benchmarks. Notably, MITS surpasses the best prior VOT competitor by around 6% on the GOT-10k test set, and significantly improves the performance of box initialization on VOS benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/yoxu515/MITS."

Our key observation is that indoor scene structures are inherently hierarchical. Hence, our network is not convolutional; it is a recursive neural network or RvNN. Using a dataset of annotated scene hierarchies, we train a variational recursive autoencoder, or RvNN-VAE, which performs scene object grouping during its encoding phase and scene generation during decoding. Specifically, a set of encoders are recursively applied to group 3D objects based on support, surround, and co-occurrence relations in a scene, encoding information about object spatial properties, semantics, and their relative positioning with respect to other objects in the hierarchy. By training a variational autoencoder (VAE), the resulting fixed-length codes roughly follow a Gaussian distribution. A novel 3D scene can be generated hierarchically by the decoder from a randomly sampled code from the learned distribution. We coin our method GRAINS, for Generative Recursive Autoencoders for INdoor Scenes. We demonstrate the capability of GRAINS to generate plausible and diverse 3D indoor scenes and compare with existing methods for 3D scene synthesis. We show applications of GRAINS including 3D scene modeling from 2D layouts, scene editing, and semantic scene segmentation via PointNet whose performance is boosted by the large quantity and variety of 3D scenes generated by our method."

Existing methods are only applicable for small graphs and lack context in the graph domain.

This allows us to study the varying instability behaviour of GNN embeddings on large graphs for both node classification and link prediction."

The multi-speaker speech synthesis architecture can learn latent embedding spaces of prosody, speaker and style variations derived from input acoustic representations thereby allowing for manipulation of the synthesized speech. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of enhancing speech recognition performance using speech synthesis using two corpora from different domains. We explore algorithms to provide the necessary acoustic and lexical diversity needed for robust speech recognition. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach as a data augmentation strategy for domain-transfer.   We find that improvements to speech recognition performance is achievable by augmenting training data with synthesized material. However, there remains a substantial gap in performance between recognizers trained on human speech those trained on synthesized speech."
59,aaai,2022,Width &amp; Depth Pruning for Vision Transformers,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i3.20222,"Network pruning reduces the computation costs of an over-parameterized network without performance damage. Prevailing pruning algorithms pre-define the width and depth of the pruned networks, and then transfer parameters from the unpruned network to pruned networks. To break the structure limitation of the pruned networks, we propose to apply neural architecture search to search directly for a network with flexible channel and layer sizes. The number of the channels/layers is learned by minimizing the loss of the pruned networks. The feature map of the pruned network is an aggregation of K feature map fragments (generated by K networks of different sizes), which are sampled based on the probability distribution.The loss can be back-propagated not only to the network weights, but also to the parameterized distribution to explicitly tune the size of the channels/layers. Specifically, we apply channel-wise interpolation to keep the feature map with different channel sizes aligned in the aggregation procedure. The maximum probability for the size in each distribution serves as the width and depth of the pruned network, whose parameters are learned by knowledge transfer, e.g., knowledge distillation, from the original networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our new perspective of network pruning compared to traditional network pruning algorithms. Various searching and knowledge transfer approaches are conducted to show the effectiveness of the two components. Code is at: https://github.com/D-X-Y/NAS-Projects."
60,aaai,2022,Intra-Inter Subject Self-Supervised Learning for Multivariate Cardiac Signals,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20376,"Learning information-rich and generalizable representations effectively from unlabeled multivariate cardiac signals to identify abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias) is valuable in real-world clinical settings but often challenging due to its complex temporal dynamics. Cardiac arrhythmias can vary significantly in temporal patterns even for the same patient ($i.e.$, intra subject difference). Meanwhile, the same type of cardiac arrhythmia can show different temporal patterns among different patients due to different cardiac structures ($i.e.$, inter subject difference). In this paper, we address the challenges by proposing an Intra-inter Subject self-supervised Learning (ISL) model that is customized for multivariate cardiac signals. Our proposed ISL model integrates medical knowledge into self-supervision to effectively learn from intra-inter subject differences. In intra subject self-supervision, ISL model first extracts heartbeat-level features from each subject using a channel-wise attentional CNN-RNN encoder. Then a stationarity test module is employed to capture the temporal dependencies between heartbeats. In inter subject self-supervision, we design a set of data augmentations according to the clinical characteristics of cardiac signals and perform contrastive learning among subjects to learn distinctive representations for various types of patients. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets were conducted. In a semi-supervised transfer learning scenario, our pre-trained ISL model leads about 10% improvement over supervised training when only 1% labeled data is available, suggesting strong generalizability and robustness of the model."

Prior works mainly focus on the observed structure or sequence of cascades, trying to predict to whom this cascade will be infected passively. In this study, we argue that user intent understanding is also a key part of information diffusion prediction. We thereby propose a novel Multi-scale Context-enhanced Dynamic Attention Network (MCDAN) to predict which user will most likely join the observed current cascades. Specifically, to consider the global interactive relationship among users, we take full advantage of user friendships and global cascading relationships, which are extracted from the social network and historical cascades, respectively. To refine the model's ability to understand the user's preference for the current cascade, we propose a multi-scale sequential hypergraph attention module to capture the dynamic preference of users at different time scales. Moreover, we design a contextual attention enhancement module to strengthen the interaction of user representations within the current cascade. Finally, to engage the user's own susceptibility, we construct a susceptibility label for each user based on user susceptibility analysis and use the rank of this label for auxiliary prediction. We conduct experiments over four widely used datasets and show that MCDAN significantly overperforms the state-of-the-art models. The average improvements are up to 10.61% in terms of Hits@100 and 9.71% in terms of MAP@100, respectively."

Recent studies revealed that adversaries can `steal' deployed models even when they have no training samples and can not get access to the model parameters or structures. Currently, there were some defense methods to alleviate this threat, mostly by increasing the cost of model stealing. In this paper, we explore the defense from another angle by verifying whether a suspicious model contains the knowledge of defender-specified \emph{external features}. Specifically, we embed the external features by tempering a few training samples with style transfer. We then train a meta-classifier to determine whether a model is stolen from the victim. This approach is inspired by the understanding that the stolen models should contain the knowledge of features learned by the victim model. We examine our method on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously, even if the stolen model is obtained via a multi-stage stealing process. The codes for reproducing main results are available at Github (https://github.com/zlh-thu/StealingVerification)."

However, graphs with unattributed nodes widely exist in real-world applications (e.g., anonymized social networks). Previous GNNs either assign random labels to nodes (which introduces artefacts to the GNN) or assign one embedding to all nodes (which fails to explicitly distinguish one node from another). Further, when these GNNs are applied to unattributed node classification problems, they have an undesired equivariance property, which are fundamentally unable to address the data with multiple possible outputs. In this paper, we analyze the limitation of existing approaches to node classification problems. Inspired by our analysis, we propose a generalized equivariance property and a Preferential Labeling technique that satisfies the desired property asymptotically. Experimental results show that we achieve high performance in several unattributed node classification tasks."

The existing methods either have difficulties in balancing the tasks of image enhancement and object detection, or often ignore the latent information beneficial for detection. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Image-Adaptive YOLO (IA-YOLO) framework, where each image can be adaptively enhanced for better detection performance. Specifically, a differentiable image processing (DIP) module is presented to take into account the adverse weather conditions for YOLO detector, whose parameters are predicted by a small convolutional neural net-work (CNN-PP). We learn CNN-PP and YOLOv3 jointly in an end-to-end fashion, which ensures that CNN-PP can learn an appropriate DIP to enhance the image for detection in a weakly supervised manner. Our proposed IA-YOLO approach can adaptively process images in both normal and adverse weather conditions. The experimental results are very encouraging, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed IA-YOLO method in both foggy and low-light scenarios."

However, matching heterogeneous graphs with partial overlap remains a challenging problem in real-world applications. This paper proposes the first practical learning-to-match method to meet this challenge. The proposed unsupervised method adopts a novel partial OT paradigm to learn a transport plan and node embeddings simultaneously. In a from-one-to-all manner, the entire learning procedure is decomposed into a series of easy-to-solve sub-procedures, each of which only handles the alignment of a single type of nodes. A mechanism for searching the transport mass is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art graph matching methods."

Our task is to map gestures to novel emotion categories not encountered in training. We introduce an adversarial, autoencoder-based representation learning that correlates 3D motion-captured gesture sequence with the vectorized representation of the natural-language perceived emotion terms using word2vec embeddings. The language-semantic embedding provides a representation of the emotion label space, and we leverage this underlying distribution to map the gesture-sequences to the appropriate categorical emotion labels. We train our method using a combination of gestures annotated with known emotion terms and gestures not annotated with any emotions. We evaluate our method on the MPI Emotional Body Expressions Database (EBEDB) and obtain an accuracy of $58.43\%$. This improves the performance of current state-of-the-art algorithms for generalized zero-shot learning by $25$--$27\%$ on the absolute."

However, for most of them, the expressive power of representing domain knowledge for OMQA, known as the program expressive power, is not well-understood yet. In this paper, we establish a number of novel characterizations for the program expressive power of several important existential rule languages, including tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs), linear TGDs, as well as disjunctive TGDs. The characterizations employ natural model-theoretic properties, and automata-theoretic properties sometimes, which thus provide powerful tools for identifying the definability of domain knowledge for OMQA in these languages."

The success of contrastive learning and self-supervised learning in the unsupervised representation learning of structured data inspires similar attempts on the graph. The current unsupervised graph representation learning and pre-training using the contrastive loss are mainly based on the contrast between handcrafted augmented graph data. However, the graph data augmentation is still not well-explored due to the unpredictable invariance. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative graph neural networks contrastive learning framework (CGCL), which uses multiple graph encoders to observe the graph. Features observed from different views act as the graph augmentation for contrastive learning between graph encoders, avoiding any perturbation to guarantee the invariance. CGCL is capable of handling both graph-level and node-level representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of CGCL in unsupervised graph representation learning and the non-necessity of handcrafted data augmentation composition for graph representation learning."

Each network is trained with respect to a multiple instance learning (MIL)-based ranking loss, together with a cross-entropy loss when clip-level pseudo labels are available. A co-teaching strategy is adopted to train the two networks. That is, clip-level pseudo labels generated from each network are used to supervise the other one at the next training round, and the two networks are learned alternatively and iteratively. Our proposed method is able to better deal with the anomalies with varying durations as well as subtle anomalies. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art WS-VAD methods."

The inharmony issue is mainly attributed to the color and illumination inconsistency produced by image editing techniques. In this work, we tend to transform the input image to another color space to magnify the domain discrepancy between inharmonious region and background, so that the model can identify the inharmonious region more easily. To this end, we present a novel framework consisting of a color mapping module and an inharmonious region localization network, in which the former is equipped with a novel domain discrepancy magnification loss and the latter could be an arbitrary localization network. Extensive experiments on image harmonization dataset show the superiority of our designed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/bcmi/MadisNet-Inharmonious-Region-Localization."
72,aaai,2022,Text Revision By On-the-Fly Representation Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21343,"Text revision refers to a family of natural language generation tasks, where the source and target sequences share moderate resemblance in surface form but differentiate in attributes, such as text formality and simplicity. Current state-of-the-art methods formulate these tasks as sequence-to-sequence learning problems, which rely on large-scale parallel training corpus. In this paper, we present an iterative in-place editing approach for text revision, which requires no parallel data. In this approach, we simply fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer with masked language modeling and attribute classification. During inference, the editing at each iteration is realized by two-step span replacement. At the first step, the distributed representation of the text optimizes on the fly towards an attribute function. At the second step, a text span is masked and another new one is proposed conditioned on the optimized representation. The empirical experiments on two typical and important text revision tasks, text formalization and text simplification, show the effectiveness of our approach. It achieves competitive and even better performance than state-of-the-art supervised methods on text simplification, and gains better performance than strong unsupervised methods on text formalization \footnote{Code and model are available at \url{https://github.com/jingjingli01/OREO}}."
73,aaai,2022,An Exact Algorithm with New Upper Bounds for the Maximum k-Defective Clique Problem in Massive Sparse Graphs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21257,"The Maximum k-Defective Clique Problem (MDCP) aims to find a maximum k-defective clique in a given graph, where a k-defective clique is a relaxation clique missing at most k edges. MDCP is NP-hard and finds many real-world applications in analyzing dense but not necessarily complete subgraphs. Exact algorithms for MDCP mainly follow the Branch-and-bound (BnB) framework, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the upper bound on the cardinality of a maximum k-defective clique. The state-of-the-art BnB MDCP algorithms calculate the upper bound quickly but conservatively as they ignore many possible missing edges. In this paper, we propose a novel CoLoring-based Upper Bound (CLUB) that uses graph coloring techniques ingeniously to detect independent sets so as to detect missing edges ignored by the previous methods. We then develop a new BnB algorithm for MDCP, called KD-Club, using CLUB in both the preprocessing stage for graph reduction and the BnB searching process for branch pruning. Extensive experiments show that KD-Club significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BnB MDCP algorithms on the number of solved instances within the cut-off time, having much smaller search tree and shorter solving time on various benchmarks."
74,aaai,2022,Transcoded Video Restoration by Temporal Spatial Auxiliary Network,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i3.20192,"In most video platforms, such as Youtube, and TikTok, the played videos usually have undergone multiple video encodings such as hardware encoding by recording devices, software encoding by video editing apps, and single/multiple video transcoding by video application servers. Previous works in compressed video restoration typically assume the compression artifacts are caused by one-time encoding. Thus, the derived solution usually does not work very well in practice. In this paper, we propose a new method, temporal spatial auxiliary network (TSAN), for transcoded video restoration. Our method considers the unique traits between video encoding and transcoding, and we consider the initial shallow encoded videos as the intermediate labels to assist the network to conduct self-supervised attention training. In addition, we employ adjacent multi-frame information and propose the temporal deformable alignment and pyramidal spatial fusion for transcoded video restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the previous techniques. The code is available at https://github.com/icecherylXuli/TSAN."

SSC has achieved rapid progress with the help of semantic context in segmentation. However, how to effectively exploit the relationships between the semantic context in semantic segmentation and geometric structure in scene completion remains under exploration. In this paper, we propose to solve outdoor SSC from the perspective of representation separation and BEV fusion. Specifically, we present the network, named SSC-RS, which uses separate branches with deep supervision to explicitly disentangle the learning procedure of the semantic and geometric representations. And a BEV fusion network equipped with the proposed Adaptive Representation Fusion (ARF) module is presented to aggregate the multi-scale features effectively and efficiently. Due to the low computational burden and powerful representation ability, our model has good generality while running in real-time. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate our SSC-RS achieves state-of-the-art performance."

However, the methods often ignore the diverse semantic relation within the images. To address this, here we propose a novel semantic relation consistency (SRC) regularization along with the decoupled contrastive learning, which utilize the diverse semantics by focusing on the heterogeneous semantics between the image patches of a single image. To further improve the performance, we present a hard negative mining by exploiting the semantic relation. We verified our method for three tasks: single-modal and multi-modal image translations, and GAN compression task for image translation. Experimental results confirmed the state-of-art performance of our method in all the three tasks."

Before they are widely adopted, the fundamental issues of robustness need to be addressed. Along this line, we propose a formal framework to evaluate word-level robustness. First, to study safe regions for a model, we introduce robustness radius which is the boundary where the model can resist any perturbation. As calculating the maximum robustness radius is computationally hard, we estimate its upper and lower bound. We repurpose attack methods as ways of seeking upper bound and design a pseudo-dynamic programming algorithm for a tighter upper bound. Then verification method is utilized for a lower bound. Further, for evaluating the robustness of regions outside a safe radius, we reexamine robustness from another view: quantification. A robustness metric with a rigorous statistical guarantee is introduced to measure the quantification of adversarial examples, which indicates the model's susceptibility to perturbations outside the safe radius. The metric helps us figure out why state-of-the-art models like BERT can be easily fooled by a few word substitutions, but generalize well in the presence of real-world noises."

They are extremely compute-intensive and have very high sample complexity. Memory replay is a mechanism that remembers and reuses past examples by saving to and replaying from a memory buffer. It has been successfully used in reinforcement learning and GANs due to better sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose \emph{Transformer with Memory Replay} (TMR), which integrates memory replay with transformer, making transformer more sample-efficient. Experiments on GLUE and SQuAD benchmark datasets show that Transformer with Memory Replay achieves at least $1\%$ point increase compared to the baseline transformer model when pretrained with the same number of examples. Further, by adopting a careful design that reduces the wall-clock time overhead of memory replay, we also empirically achieve a better runtime efficiency."

In this work, we propose a novel modality-adaptive mixup and invariant decomposition (MID) approach for RGB-infrared person re-identification towards learning modality-invariant and discriminative representations. MID designs a modality-adaptive mixup scheme to generate suitable mixed modality images between RGB and infrared images for mitigating the inherent modality discrepancy at the pixel-level. It formulates modality mixup procedure as Markov decision process, where an actor-critic agent learns dynamical and local linear interpolation policy between different regions of cross-modality images under a deep reinforcement learning framework. Such policy guarantees modality-invariance in a more continuous latent space and avoids manifold intrusion by the corrupted mixed modality samples. Moreover, to further counter modality discrepancy and enforce invariant visual semantics at the feature-level, MID employs modality-adaptive convolution decomposition to disassemble a regular convolution layer into modality-specific basis layers and a modality-shared coefficient layer. Extensive experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of MID over state-of-the-art methods."

Most of the existing deep-learning-based methods constrain the network to generate derained images but few of them explore features from intermediate layers, different levels, and different modules which are beneficial for rain streaks removal. In this paper, we propose a high-order collaborative network with multi-scale compact constraints and a bidirectional scale-content similarity mining module to exploit features from deep networks externally and internally for rain streaks removal. Externally, we design a deraining framework with three sub-networks trained in a collaborative manner, where the bottom network transmits intermediate features to the middle network which also receives shallower rainy features from the top network and sends back features to the bottom network. Internally, we enforce multi-scale compact constraints on the intermediate layers of deep networks to learn useful features via a Laplacian pyramid. Further, we develop a bidirectional scale-content similarity mining module to explore features at different scales in a down-to-up and up-to-down manner. To improve the model performance on real-world images, we propose an online-update learning approach, which uses real-world rainy images to fine-tune the network and update the deraining results in a self-supervised manner.

We show that in deep actor-critic methods that aim to overcome the overestimation bias, if the reinforcement signals received by the agent have a high variance, a significant underestimation bias arises. To minimize the underestimation, we introduce a parameter-free, novel deep Q-learning variant. Our Q-value update rule combines the notions behind Clipped Double Q-learning and Maxmin Q-learning by computing the critic objective through the nested combination of maximum and minimum operators to bound the approximate value estimates. We evaluate our modification on the suite of several OpenAI Gym continuous control tasks, improving the state-of-the-art in every environment tested."

However, recent research has shown that applying existing binarization algorithms to diverse tasks, architectures, and hardware in realistic scenarios is still not straightforward. Common challenges of binarization, such as accuracy degradation and efficiency limitation, suggest that its attributes are not fully understood. To close this gap, we present BiBench, a rigorously designed benchmark with in-depth analysis for network binarization. We first carefully scrutinize the requirements of binarization in the actual production and define evaluation tracks and metrics for a comprehensive and fair investigation. Then, we evaluate and analyze a series of milestone binarization algorithms that function at the operator level and with extensive influence. Our benchmark reveals that 1) the binarized operator has a crucial impact on the performance and deployability of binarized networks; 2) the accuracy of binarization varies significantly across different learning tasks and neural architectures; 3) binarization has demonstrated promising efficiency potential on edge devices despite the limited hardware support. The results and analysis also lead to a promising paradigm for accurate and efficient binarization. We believe that BiBench will contribute to the broader adoption of binarization and serve as a foundation for future research. The code for our BiBench is released https://github.com/htqin/BiBench ."

ELM is efficient due to its utilization of the analytical approach to compute weights between hidden and output layer. However, ELM still fails to output the semantic classification outcome. To address such limitation, in this paper, we propose a diversified top-k shapelets transform framework, where the shapelets are the subsequences i.e., the best representative and interpretative features of each class. As we identified, the most challenge problems are how to extract the best k shapelets in original candidate sets and how to automatically determine the k value. Specifically, we first define the similar shapelets and diversified top-k shapelets to construct diversity shapelets graph. Then, a novel diversity graph based top-k shapelets extraction algorithm named as \textbf{DivTopkshapelets}\ is proposed to search top-k diversified shapelets. Finally, we propose a shapelets transformed ELM algorithm named as \textbf{DivShapELM} to automatically determine the k value, which is further utilized for time series classification. The experimental results over public data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional ELM algorithm in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."

Standard architectures require training separate models for different types of audio sources. Although some universal separators employ a single model to target multiple sources, they have difficulty generalizing to unseen sources. In this paper, we propose a three-component pipeline to train a universal audio source separator from a large, but weakly-labeled dataset: AudioSet. First, we propose a transformer-based sound event detection system for processing weakly-labeled training data. Second, we devise a query-based audio separation model that leverages this data for model training. Third, we design a latent embedding processor to encode queries that specify audio targets for separation, allowing for zero-shot generalization. Our approach uses a single model for source separation of multiple sound types, and relies solely on weakly-labeled data for training. In addition, the proposed audio separator can be used in a zero-shot setting, learning to separate types of audio sources that were never seen in training. To evaluate the separation performance, we test our model on MUSDB18, while training on the disjoint AudioSet. We further verify the zero-shot performance by conducting another experiment on audio source types that are held-out from training. The model achieves comparable Source-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) performance to current supervised models in both cases."

A key to our method is Shuffle and Divide (SaD), a simple text augmentation algorithm that sets up a pretext task required for contrastive updates to BERT-based document embedding. SaD splits a document into two sub-documents containing randomly shuffled words in the entire documents. The sub-documents are considered positive examples, leaving all other documents in the corpus as negatives. After SaD, we repeat the contrastive update and clustering phases until convergence. It is naturally a time-consuming, cumbersome task to label text documents, and our method can help alleviate human efforts, which are most expensive resources in AI. We have empirically evaluated our method by performing unsupervised text classification on the 20 Newsgroups, Reuters-21578, BBC, and BBCSport datasets. In particular, our method pushes the current state-of-the-art, SS-SB-MT, on 20 Newsgroups by 20.94% in accuracy.

Besides the security concerns of potential adversarial examples, adversarial training can also improve the generalization ability of neural networks, train robust neural networks, and provide interpretability for neural networks. In this work, we introduce adversarial training in time series analysis to enhance the neural networks for better generalization ability by taking the finance field as an example. Rethinking existing research on adversarial training, we propose the adaptively scaled adversarial training (ASAT) in time series analysis, by rescaling data at different time slots with adaptive scales. Experimental results show that the proposed ASAT can improve both the generalization ability and the adversarial robustness of neural networks compared to the baselines. Compared to the traditional adversarial training algorithm, ASAT can achieve better generalization ability and similar adversarial robustness."

Although there has been some research in this field, the problem has not been fully solved. In this paper we present an approach to solve this problem by using values from statistics, information theory and chaos theory as features to correctly identify the onset of imagined words in a continuous signal. On detecting the onsets of imagined words, the highest True Positive Rate achieved by our approach was obtained using features based on the generalized Hurst exponent, this True Positive Rate was 0.69 and 0.77 with a timing error tolerance region of 3 and 4 seconds respectively."

Through careful observation of numerous rainy photos, we have found that the images are generally affected by various rainwater artifacts such as raindrops, rain streaks, and rainy haze, which impact the image quality from both near and far distances, resulting in a complex and intertwined process of image degradation. However, current deraining techniques are limited in their ability to address only one or two types of rainwater, which poses a challenge in removing the mixture of rain (MOR). In this study, we propose an effective image deraining paradigm for Mixture of rain REmoval, called DEMore-Net, which takes full account of the MOR effect. Going beyond the existing deraining wisdom, DEMore-Net is a joint learning paradigm that integrates depth estimation and MOR removal tasks to achieve superior rain removal. The depth information can offer additional meaningful guidance information based on distance, thus better helping DEMore-Net remove different types of rainwater. Moreover, this study explores normalization approaches in image deraining tasks and introduces a new Hybrid Normalization Block (HNB) to enhance the deraining performance of DEMore-Net. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and real-world MOR photos fully validate the superiority of the proposed DEMore-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yz-wang/DEMore-Net."

Standard approaches for computing equilibria in these games reformulate the followers' best response as constraints in the leader's optimization problem. These reformulation approaches can sometimes be effective, but often get trapped in low-quality solutions when followers' objectives are non-linear or non-quadratic. Moreover, these approaches assume a unique equilibrium or a specific equilibrium concept, e.g., optimistic or pessimistic, which is a limiting assumption in many situations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a stochastic gradient descent--based approach, where the leader's strategy is updated by differentiating through the followers' best responses. We frame the leader's optimization as a learning problem against followers' equilibrium, which allows us to decouple the followers' equilibrium constraints from the leader's problem. This approach also addresses cases with multiple equilibria and arbitrary equilibrium selection procedures by back-propagating through a sampled Nash equilibrium. To this end, this paper introduces a novel concept called equilibrium flow to formally characterize the set of equilibrium selection processes where the gradient with respect to a sampled equilibrium is an unbiased estimate of the true gradient. We evaluate our approach experimentally against existing baselines in three Stackelberg problems with multiple followers and find that in each case, our approach is able to achieve higher utility for the leader."

They generally take all deep descriptors from neural networks into consideration while ignoring that some of them are useless in classification due to their limited receptive field, e.g., task-irrelevant descriptors could be misleading and multiple aggregative descriptors from background clutter could even overwhelm the object's presence. In this paper, we argue that a Mutual Nearest Neighbor (MNN) relation should be established to explicitly select the query descriptors that are most relevant to each task and discard less relevant ones from aggregative clutters in FSL. Specifically, we propose Discriminative Mutual Nearest Neighbor Neural Network (DMN4) for FSL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-arts on both fine-grained and generalized datasets."

One promising approach that learns these options end-to-end is the option-critic (OC) framework. We examine and show in this paper that OC does not decompose a problem into simpler sub-problems, but instead increases the size of the search over policy space with each option considering the entire state space during learning. This issue can result in practical limitations of this method, including sample inefficient learning. To address this problem, we introduce Context-Specific Representation Abstraction for Deep Option Learning (CRADOL), a new framework that considers both temporal abstraction and context-specific representation abstraction to effectively reduce the size of the search over policy space. Specifically, our method learns a factored belief state representation that enables each option to learn a policy over only a subsection of the state space. We test our method against hierarchical, non-hierarchical, and modular recurrent neural network baselines, demonstrating significant sample efficiency improvements in challenging partially observable environments."

In a rosca, a fixed group of participants regularly contribute sums of money to a pot. This pot is then allocated periodically using lottery, aftermarket, or auction mechanisms. Roscas are empirically well-studied in economics. They are, however, challenging to study theoretically due to their dynamic nature. Typical economic analyses of roscas stop at coarse ordinal welfare comparisons to other credit allocation mechanisms, leaving much of roscas' ubiquity unexplained. In this work, we take an algorithmic perspective on the study of roscas. Building on techniques from the price of anarchy literature, we present worst-case welfare approximation guarantees. We further experimentally compare the welfare of outcomes as key features of the environment vary. These cardinal welfare analyses further rationalize the prevalence of roscas.

However, unbalanced misinformation exposures among individuals urge to study fair allocation of mitigation resources. Moreover, the network has random dynamics which change over time. Therefore, we introduce a stochastic and non-stationary knapsack problem, and we apply its resolution to mitigate misinformation in social network campaigns. We further propose a generic misinformation mitigation algorithm that is robust to different social networks' misinformation statistics, allowing a promising impact in real-world scenarios. A novel loss function ensures fair mitigation among users. We achieve fairness by intelligently allocating a mitigation incentivization budget to the knapsack, and optimizing the loss function. To this end, a team of Learning Automata (LA) drives the budget allocation. Each LA is associated with a user and learns to minimize its exposure to misinformation by performing a non-stationary and stochastic walk over its state space. Our results show how our LA-based method is robust and outperforms similar misinformation mitigation methods in how the mitigation is fairly influencing the network users."

But given the paucity of data, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the robustness of systems with respect to recognizing a diverse set of entities. We propose a method for auditing the in-domain robustness of systems, focusing specifically on differences in performance due to the national origin of entities. We create entity-switched datasets, in which named entities in the original texts are replaced by plausible named entities of the same type but of different national origin. We find that state-of-the-art systems' performance vary widely even in-domain: In the same context, entities from certain origins are more reliably recognized than entities from elsewhere. Systems perform best on American and Indian entities, and worst on Vietnamese and Indonesian entities. This auditing approach can facilitate the development of more robust named entity recognition systems, and will allow research in this area to consider fairness criteria that have received heightened attention in other predictive technology work."
100,aaai,2022,Building Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems with Situated Visual Context,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21710,"Most popular goal-oriented dialogue agents are capable of understanding the conversational context. However, with the surge of virtual assistants with screen, the next generation of agents are required to also understand screen context in order to provide a proper interactive experience, and better understand users' goals. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal conversational framework, where the dialogue agent's next action and their arguments are derived jointly conditioned both on the conversational and the visual context. Specifically, we propose a new model, that can reason over the visual context within a conversation and populate API arguments with visual entities given the user query. Our model can recognize visual features such as color and shape as well as the metadata based features such as price or star rating associated with a visual entity. In order to train our model, due to a lack of suitable multimodal conversational datasets, we also propose a novel multimodal dialog simulator to generate synthetic data and also collect realistic user data from MTurk to improve model robustness. The proposed model achieves a reasonable 85% model accuracy, without high inference latency. We also demonstrate the proposed approach in a prototypical furniture shopping experience for a multimodal virtual assistant."
101,aaai,2022,Locally Fair Partitioning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20401,"We model the societal task of redistricting political districts as a partitioning problem: Given a set of $n$ points in the plane, each belonging to one of two parties, and a parameter $k$, our goal is to compute a partition $\Pi$ of the plane into regions so that each region contains roughly $\sigma = n/k$ points. $\Pi$ should satisfy a notion of ''local'' fairness, which is related to the notion of core, a well-studied concept in cooperative game theory. A region is associated with the majority party in that region, and a point is unhappy in $\Pi$ if it belongs to the minority party. A group $D$ of roughly $\sigma$ contiguous points is called a deviating group with respect to $\Pi$ if majority of points in $D$ are unhappy in $\Pi$. The partition $\Pi$ is locally fair if there is no deviating group with respect to $\Pi$.   This paper focuses on a restricted case when points lie in $1$D. The problem is non-trivial even in this case. We consider both adversarial and ''beyond worst-case"" settings for this problem. For the former, we characterize the input parameters for which a locally fair partition always exists; we also show that a locally fair partition may not exist for certain parameters. We then consider input models where there are ''runs'' of red and blue points. For such clustered inputs, we show that a locally fair partition may not exist for certain values of $\sigma$, but an approximate locally fair partition exists if we allow some regions to have smaller sizes. We finally present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a locally fair partition if one exists."

The existing credit network research either took a macro perspective to clarify the topological properties of financial systems at a descriptive level or analyzed the risk transmission path and characteristics of individual entities with much pre-assumptions of the network. Here, we used the theory of complex network to model China's credit system from 2000 to 2014 based on actual financial data. A bipartite financial institution-firm network and its projected sub-networks were constructed for an integrated analysis from both macro and micro perspectives, and the relationship between typological properties and systematic credit risk control was also explored. The typological analysis of the networks suggested that the financial institutions and firms were highly but asymmetrically connected, and the credit network structure made local idiosyncratic shocks possible to proliferate through the whole economy. In addition, the Chinese credit market was still dominated by state-owned financial institutions with firms competing fiercely for financial resources in the past fifteen years. Furthermore, the credit risk score (CRS) was introduced by simulation to identify the systematically important vertices in terms of systematic risk control. The results indicated that the vertices with more access to the credit market or less likelihood to be a bridge in the network were the ones with higher systematically importance. The empirical results from this study would provide specific policy suggestions to financial regulators on supervisory approaches and optimizing the allocation of regulatory resources to enhance the robustness of credit systems in China and in other countries."

Human pose generally consists of up to 22 Joint Angles of various segments, and their respective bone lengths, but the way these various segments interact can affect the validity of a pose. Looking at the Knee-Ankle segment alone, we can observe that clearly, the Knee cannot bend forward beyond it's roughly 90 degree point, amongst various other impossible poses below."

Some methods proposed the adaptation of CNNs to ultra-wide FoV images by learning deformable kernels. However, they are limited by the Euclidean geometry and their accuracy degrades under strong distortions caused by fisheye projections. In this work, we demonstrate that learning the shape of convolution kernels in non-Euclidean spaces is better than existing deformable kernel methods. In particular, we propose a new approach that learns deformable kernel parameters (positions) in hyperbolic space. FisheyeHDK is a hybrid CNN architecture combining hyperbolic and Euclidean convolution layers for positions and features learning. First, we provide an intuition of hyperbolic space for wide FoV images. Using synthetic distortion profiles, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We select two datasets - Cityscapes and BDD100K 2020 - of perspective images which we transform to fisheye equivalents at different scaling factors (analog to focal lengths). Finally, we provide an experiment on data collected by a real fisheye camera. Validations and experiments show that our approach improves existing deformable kernel methods for CNN adaptation on fisheye images."
105,aaai,2022,PYLON: A PyTorch Framework for Learning with Constraints,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21711,"Imposing explicit constraints is relatively new but increasingly pressing in deep learning, stimulated by, e.g., trustworthy AI that performs robust optimization over complicated perturbation sets and scientific applications that need to respect physical laws and constraints. However, it can be hard to reliably solve constrained deep learning problems without optimization expertise. The existing deep learning frameworks do not admit constraints. General-purpose optimization packages can handle constraints but do not perform auto-differentiation and have trouble dealing with nonsmoothness. In this paper, we introduce a new software package called NCVX, whose initial release contains the solver PyGRANSO, a PyTorch-enabled general-purpose optimization package for constrained machine/deep learning problems, the first of its kind. NCVX inherits auto-differentiation, GPU acceleration, and tensor variables from PyTorch, and is built on freely available and widely used open-source frameworks. NCVX is available at https://ncvx.org, with detailed documentation and numerous examples from machine/deep learning and other fields."

We developed a two-tier approach that first encodes sociolinguistic behavior as linguistic features then use reinforcement learning to estimate the advantage afforded to any player. In the first tier, sociolinguistic behavior, such as Friendship and Reasoning, that speakers use to influence others are encoded as linguistic features to identify the persuasive strategies applied by each player in simultaneous two-party dialogues. In the second tier, a reinforcement learning approach is used to estimate a graph-aware reward function to quantify the advantage afforded to each player based on their standing in this multiparty setup. We apply this technique to the game Diplomacy, using a dataset comprising of over 15,000 messages exchanged between 78 users. Our graph-aware approach shows robust performance compared to a context-agnostic setup."
107,aaai,2022,Distributed Learning with Strategic Users: A Repeated Game Approach,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20543,"We consider a computing system where a master processor assigns tasks for execution to worker processors through the Internet. We model the workers decision of whether to comply (compute the task) or not (return a bogus result to save the computation cost) as a mixed extension of a strategic game among workers. That is, we assume that workers are rational in a game-theoretic sense, and that they randomize their strategic choice. Workers are assigned multiple tasks in subsequent rounds. We model the system as an infinitely repeated game of the mixed extension of the strategic game. In each round, the master decides stochastically whether to accept the answer of the majority or verify the answers received, at some cost. Incentives and/or penalties are applied to workers accordingly. Under the above framework, we study the conditions in which the master can reliably obtain tasks results, exploiting that the repeated games model captures the effect of long-term interaction. That is, workers take into account that their behavior in one computation will have an effect on the behavior of other workers in the future. Indeed, should a worker be found to deviate from some agreed strategic choice, the remaining workers would change their own strategy to penalize the deviator. Hence, being rational, workers do not deviate. We identify analytically the parameter conditions to induce a desired worker behavior, and we evaluate experi- mentally the mechanisms derived from such conditions. We also compare the performance of our mechanisms with a previously known multi-round mechanism based on reinforcement learning."

Their work has the potential to propel astronomy into a new era by providing an entirely new means of observing astronomical phenomena. Gravitational-wave science encompasses astrophysics, physics, engineering, and quantum optics. As a result, this curriculum exposes students to the interdisciplinary nature of science. It also provides an authentic context for students to learn about astrophysical sources, data analysis techniques, cutting-edge detector technology, and error analysis."

We refer the reader to the full and updated version.   We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods among agents with 2-value additive valuations. Our goal is to find an allocation with maximum Nash social welfare, i.e., the geometric mean of the valuations of the agents. We give a polynomial-time algorithm to find a Nash social welfare maximizing allocation when the valuation functions are integrally 2-valued, i.e., each agent has a value either $1$ or $p$ for each good, for some positive integer $p$. We then extend our algorithm to find a better approximation factor for general 2-value instances."

Inspired by the recent image inpainting methods, we propose an end-to-end hybrid masked face recognition system, namely HiMFR, consisting of three significant parts: masked face detector, face inpainting, and face recognition. The masked face detector module applies a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT\_b32) to detect whether faces are covered with masked or not. The inpainting module uses a fine-tune image inpainting model based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to restore faces. Finally, the hybrid face recognition module based on ViT with an EfficientNetB3 backbone recognizes the faces. We have implemented and evaluated our proposed method on four different publicly available datasets: CelebA, SSDMNV2, MAFA, {Pubfig83} with our locally collected small dataset, namely Face5. Comprehensive experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed HiMFR method with competitive performance. Code is available at https://github.com/mdhosen/HiMFR"

Since rankings can reveal preferences of voters (which a voter might like to keep private), it is important to aggregate preferences in such a way to preserve privacy. In this work, we present differentially private algorithms for rank aggregation in the pure and approximate settings along with distribution-independent utility upper and lower bounds. In addition to bounds in the central model, we also present utility bounds for the local model of differential privacy."

First, we develop a general purpose multi-modal neural fusion network model MSNF for learning students' academic information representation by fusing spatial and temporal unstructured advising notes with spatiotemporal structured data. MSNF combines a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based document embedding framework to represent each advising note, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to model temporal advising note embeddings, LSTM network to model students' temporal performance variables and students' static demographics altogether. The final fused representation from MSNF has been utilized on a Multi-Task Cascade Learning (MTCL) model towards building MSNF-MTCL for predicting 5 student retention risks. We evaluate MSNFMTCL on a large educational database consists of 36,445 college students over 18 years period of time that provides promising performances comparing with the nearest state-of-art models. Additionally, we test the fairness of such model given the existence of biases."
113,aaai,2022,Pinpointing Fine-Grained Relationships between Hateful Tweets and Replies,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21284,"Twitter is one of the most popular online micro-blogging and social networking platforms. This platform allows individuals to freely express opinions and interact with others regardless of geographic barriers. However, with the good that online platforms offer, also comes the bad. Twitter and other social networking platforms have created new spaces for incivility. With the growing interest on the consequences of uncivil behavior online, understanding how a toxic comment impacts online interactions is imperative. We analyze a random sample of more than 85,300 Twitter conversations to examine differences between toxic and non-toxic conversations and the relationship between toxicity and user engagement. We find that toxic conversations, those with at least one toxic tweet, are longer but have fewer individual users contributing to the dialogue compared to the non-toxic conversations. However, within toxic conversations, toxicity is positively associated with more individual Twitter users participating in conversations. This suggests that overall, more visible conversations are more likely to include toxic replies.   Additionally, we examine the sequencing of toxic tweets and its impact on conversations. Toxic tweets often occur as the main tweet or as the first reply, and lead to greater overall conversation toxicity. We also find a relationship between the toxicity of the first reply to a toxic tweet and the toxicity of the conversation, such that whether the first reply is toxic or non-toxic sets the stage for the overall toxicity of the conversation, following the idea that hate can beget hate."

We then go the other way around and suggest that the second incompleteness theorem gives a possible resolution of the surprise examination paradox. Roughly speaking, we argue that the flaw in the derivation of the paradox is that it contains a hidden assumption that one can prove the consistency of the mathematical theory in which the derivation is done; which is impossible by the second incompleteness theorem."

We reformulate certification in randomized smoothing setting for both general vector field and parameterized deformations and propose DeformRS-VF and DeformRS-Par, respectively. Our new formulation scales to large networks on large input datasets. For instance, DeformRS-Par certifies rich deformations, covering translations, rotations, scaling, affine deformations, and other visually aligned deformations such as ones parameterized by Discrete-Cosine-Transform basis. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet show competitive performance of DeformRS-Par achieving a certified accuracy of $39\%$ against perturbed rotations in the set $[-10\degree,10\degree]$ on ImageNet."

However, the straightforward combination between adversarial training and federated learning in one framework can lead to the undesired robustness deterioration. We discover that the attribution behind this phenomenon is that the generated adversarial data could exacerbate the data heterogeneity among local clients, making the wrapped federated learning perform poorly. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel framework called Slack Federated Adversarial Training (SFAT), assigning the client-wise slack during aggregation to combat the intensified heterogeneity. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence of the proposed method to properly relax the objective when combining federated learning and adversarial training. Experimentally, we verify the rationality and effectiveness of SFAT on various benchmarked and real-world datasets with different adversarial training and federated optimization methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZFancy/SFAT."

The major bottleneck for CM word embeddings is switching points, where the language switches. These locations lack in contextually and statistical systems fail to model this phenomena due to high variance in the seen examples. In this paper we present our initial observations on applying switching point based positional encoding techniques for CM language, specifically Hinglish (Hindi - English). Results are only marginally better than SOTA, but it is evident that positional encoding could bean effective way to train position sensitive language models for CM text."

INEX 2003 content-and-structure topics can be classified in two categories: the first retrieving full articles as final answers, and the second retrieving more specific elements within articles as final answers. We show that for both topic categories our initial hybrid system improves the retrieval effectiveness of a native XML database. For ranking the final answer elements, we propose and evaluate a novel retrieval model that utilises the structural relationships between the answer elements of a native XML database and retrieves Coherent Retrieval Elements. The final results of our experiments show that when the XML retrieval task focusses on highly relevant elements our hybrid XML retrieval system with the Coherent Retrieval Elements module is 1.8 times more effective than Zettair and 3 times more effective than eXist, and yields an effective content-and-structure XML retrieval."

We consider here a simple setting where votes consist of approval ballots: each voter approves a set of alternatives which they believe can possibly be the ground truth. Based on the intuitive idea that more reliable votes contain fewer alternatives, we define several noise models that are approval voting variants of the Mallows model. The likelihood-maximizing alternative is then characterized as the winner of a weighted approval rule, where the weight of a ballot decreases with its cardinality. We have conducted an experiment on three image annotation datasets; they conclude that rules based on our noise model outperform standard approval voting; the best performance is obtained by a variant of the Condorcet noise model."

Further, gender equity continues to be an issue in the entrepreneurial sector, particularly in STEM-focused entrepreneurship. In this context, this study was designed to explore the effects of a one-day female-focused STEM-based entrepreneurship program (for brevity, we call it the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program) on the entrepreneurial intention of secondary school female students. The study collected data from two surveys completed by 193 secondary school female students, aged 14-16 years, who participated in the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program. This program encouraged girls to develop and implement creative computational solutions to socially relevant problems, with an Internet of Things (IoT) component using the micro:bit device. The findings reveal that a key factor in the development of entrepreneurial attitudes in young female students is associated with soft-skills development, particularly in the areas of creative thinking, risk-taking, problem-solving, and leadership development. The importance of meaningful human connections, including positive role modelling and peer to peer learning were also important factors in fostering entrepreneurial intent. With these factors in mind, our findings highlight that the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program substantially increased the entrepreneurial intention of secondary school female students. In addition, this study offers actionable implications and recommendations to develop and deliver entrepreneurship education programs for secondary school level students."
121,aaai,2022,Goal Recognition as Reinforcement Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21198,"Most approaches for goal recognition rely on specifications of the possible dynamics of the actor in the environment when pursuing a goal. These specifications suffer from two key issues. First, encoding these dynamics requires careful design by a domain expert, which is often not robust to noise at recognition time. Second, existing approaches often need costly real-time computations to reason about the likelihood of each potential goal. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines model-free reinforcement learning and goal recognition to alleviate the need for careful, manual domain design, and the need for costly online executions. This framework consists of two main stages: Offline learning of policies or utility functions for each potential goal, and online inference. We provide a first instance of this framework using tabular Q-learning for the learning stage, as well as three measures that can be used to perform the inference stage. The resulting instantiation achieves state-of-the-art performance against goal recognizers on standard evaluation domains and superior performance in noisy environments."

Effective human-agent collaboration requires users to understand the agent's behavior, as failing to do so may cause reduced productivity, misuse or frustration. Agent strategy summarization methods are used to describe the strategy of an agent to its destined user through demonstration. A summary's objective is to maximize the user's understanding of the agent's aptitude by showcasing its behaviour in a selected set of world states. While shown to be useful, we show that current methods are limited when tasked with comparing between agents, as each summary is independently generated for a specific agent. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating dependent and contrastive summaries that emphasize the differences between agent policies by identifying states in which the agents disagree on the best course of action. We conduct user studies to assess the usefulness of disagreement-based summaries for identifying superior agents and conveying agent differences. Results show disagreement-based summaries lead to improved user performance compared to summaries generated using HIGHLIGHTS, a strategy summarization algorithm which generates summaries for each agent independently."
123,aaai,2022,No Task Left Behind: Multi-Task Learning of Knowledge Tracing and Option Tracing for Better Student Assessment,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20364,"Student assessment is one of the most fundamental tasks in the field of AI Education (AIEd). One of the most common approach to student assessment is Knowledge Tracing (KT), which evaluates a student's knowledge state by predicting whether the student will answer a given question correctly or not. However, in the context of multiple choice (polytomous) questions, conventional KT approaches are limited in that they only consider the binary (dichotomous) correctness label (i.e., correct or incorrect), and disregard the specific option chosen by the student. Meanwhile, Option Tracing (OT) attempts to model a student by predicting which option they will choose for a given question, but overlooks the correctness information. In this paper, we propose Dichotomous-Polytomous Multi-Task Learning (DP-MTL), a multi-task learning framework that combines KT and OT for more precise student assessment. In particular, we show that the KT objective acts as a regularization term for OT in the DP-MTL framework, and propose an appropriate architecture for applying our method on top of existing deep learning-based KT models. We experimentally confirm that DP-MTL significantly improves both KT and OT performances, and also benefits downstream tasks such as Score Prediction (SP)."

While humans find the answer by either eliminating wrong candidates or first constructing the answer, prior deep neural network (DNN)-based methods focus on the former discriminative approach. This paper aims to design a framework for the latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel generative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization problem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract propositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic layer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that LoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning under the RAVEN benchmark, i.e., reconstructing answers based on capturing correct rules of various attributes from observations."

126,aaai,2022,Dimensionality and Coordination in Voting: The Distortion of STV,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20404,"We study the performance of voting mechanisms from a utilitarian standpoint, under the recently introduced framework of metric-distortion, offering new insights along three main lines. First, if $d$ represents the doubling dimension of the metric space, we show that the distortion of STV is $O(d \log \log m)$, where $m$ represents the number of candidates. For doubling metrics this implies an exponential improvement over the lower bound for general metrics, and as a special case it effectively answers a question left open by Skowron and Elkind (AAAI '17) regarding the distortion of STV under low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. More broadly, this constitutes the first nexus between the performance of any voting rule and the ""intrinsic dimensionality"" of the underlying metric space. We also establish a nearly-matching lower bound, refining the construction of Skowron and Elkind. Moreover, motivated by the efficiency of STV, we investigate whether natural learning rules can lead to low-distortion outcomes. Specifically, we introduce simple, deterministic and decentralized exploration/exploitation dynamics, and we show that they converge to a candidate with $O(1)$ distortion. Finally, driven by applications in facility location games, we consider several refinements and extensions of the standard metric-setting. Namely, we prove that the deterministic mechanism recently introduced by Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah (FOCS '20) attains the optimal distortion bound of $2$ under ultra-metrics, while it also comes close to our lower bound under distances satisfying approximate triangle inequalities."

This task requires not only to understand the context clues which play an important role in planning the plot but also to handle implicit knowledge to make a reasonable, coherent story.   In this paper, we devise a novel model for story ending generation. The model adopts an incremental encoding scheme to represent context clues which are spanning in the story context. In addition, commonsense knowledge is applied through multi-source attention to facilitate story comprehension, and thus to help generate coherent and reasonable endings. Through building context clues and using implicit knowledge, the model is able to produce reasonable story endings. context clues implied in the post and make the inference based on it.   Automatic and manual evaluation shows that our model can generate more reasonable story endings than state-of-the-art baselines."

These models provide a continuous-time latent representation of the underlying dynamical system where new observations at arbitrary time points can be used to update the latent representation of the dynamical system. Existing parameterizations for the dynamics functions of Neural ODEs limit the ability of the model to retain global information about the time series; specifically, a piece-wise integration of the latent process between observations can result in a loss of memory on the dynamic patterns of previously observed data points. We propose PolyODE, a Neural ODE that models the latent continuous-time process as a projection onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials. This formulation enforces long-range memory and preserves a global representation of the underlying dynamical system. Our construction is backed by favourable theoretical guarantees and in a series of experiments, we demonstrate that it outperforms previous works in the reconstruction of past and future data, and in downstream prediction tasks."

The convergence of solutions in $C^\infty$-topology to a smooth strictly convex soliton as $t$ approaches to infinity is obtained as a consequence of these estimates together with an earlier result of Andrews. The estimates are established via the study of a new entropy functional for the flow.

Understanding the job arrival rate is crucial for accurately predicting future changes in cloud workloads and proactively provisioning and de-provisioning VMs for hosting the applications. However, developing a model that accurately predicts cloud workload changes is extremely challenging due to the dynamic nature of cloud workloads. Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models have been developed for cloud workload prediction. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art LSTM model leverages recurrences to predict, which naturally adds complexity and increases the inference overhead as input sequences grow longer. To develop a cloud workload prediction model with high accuracy and low inference overhead, this work presents a novel time-series forecasting model called WGAN-gp Transformer, inspired by the Transformer network and improved Wasserstein-GANs. The proposed method adopts a Transformer network as a generator and a multi-layer perceptron as a critic. The extensive evaluations with real-world workload traces show WGAN-gp Transformer achieves 5 times faster inference time with up to 5.1 percent higher prediction accuracy against the state-of-the-art approach. We also apply WGAN-gp Transformer to auto-scaling mechanisms on Google cloud platforms, and the WGAN-gp Transformer-based auto-scaling mechanism outperforms the LSTM-based mechanism by significantly reducing VM over-provisioning and under-provisioning rates."

In addition, from the time of the early civilizations, lottery has also been considered as an apposite method to allocate scarce resources. Technically, any scheme for lottery needs to be fair and secure, but none of the classical schemes for lottery are unconditionally secure and fair. As fairness demands complete unpredictability of the outcome of the lottery, it essentially requires perfect randomness. Quantum mechanics not only guarantees the generation of perfect randomness, it can also provide unconditional security. Motivated by these facts, a set of strategies for performing lottery using different type of quantum resources (e.g., single photon states, and entangled states) are proposed here, and it's established that the proposed strategies leads to unconditionally secure and fair lottery schemes. A scheme for semi-quantum lottery that allows some classical users to participate in the lottery involving quantum resources is also proposed and the merits and demerits of all the proposed schemes are critically analysed. Its also established that the level of security is intrinsically related to the type of quantum resources being utilized. Further, its shown that the proposed schemes can be experimentally realized using currently available technology, and that may herald a new era of commercial lottery."

While these attributions are often claimed to hold the potential to improve human ""understanding"" of the models, surprisingly little work explicitly evaluates progress towards this aspiration. In this paper, we conduct a crowdsourcing study, where participants interact with deception detection models that have been trained to distinguish between genuine and fake hotel reviews. They are challenged both to simulate the model on fresh reviews, and to edit reviews with the goal of lowering the probability of the originally predicted class. Successful manipulations would lead to an adversarial example. During the training (but not the test) phase, input spans are highlighted to communicate salience. Through our evaluation, we observe that for a linear bag-of-words model, participants with access to the feature coefficients during training are able to cause a larger reduction in model confidence in the testing phase when compared to the no-explanation control. For the BERT-based classifier, popular local explanations do not improve their ability to reduce the model confidence over the no-explanation case. Remarkably, when the explanation for the BERT model is given by the (global) attributions of a linear model trained to imitate the BERT model, people can effectively manipulate the model."

We refer to this as introduced unfairness, and investigate the conditions under which it may arise. To this end, we propose introduced total variation as a measure of introduced unfairness, and establish graphical conditions under which it may be incentivised to occur. These criteria imply that adding the sensitive attribute as a feature removes the incentive for introduced variation under well-behaved loss functions. Additionally, taking a causal perspective, introduced path-specific effects shed light on the issue of when specific paths should be considered fair."

Explanations help human partners better understand the situation and maintain trust of their teammates. Prior work on robot generating explanations focuses on providing the reasoning behind its decision making. These approaches, however, fail to heed the cognitive requirement of understanding an explanation. In other words, while they provide the right explanations from the explainer's perspective, the explainee part of the equation is ignored. In this work, we address an important aspect along this direction that contributes to a better understanding of a given explanation, which we refer to as the progressiveness of explanations. A progressive explanation improves understanding by limiting the cognitive effort required at each step of making the explanation. As a result, such explanations are expected to be smoother and hence easier to understand. A general formulation of progressive explanation is presented. Algorithms are provided based on several alternative quantifications of cognitive effort as an explanation is being made, which are evaluated in a standard planning competition domain."

Systems involving tree-structured translation models tend to be complex. This article aims to reduce the conceptual complexity of such systems, in order to make them easier to design, implement, debug, use, study, understand, explain, modify, and improve. In service of this goal, the article extends the theory of semiring parsing to arrive at a novel abstract parsing algorithm with five functional parameters: a logic, a grammar, a semiring, a search strategy, and a termination condition. The article then shows that all the common algorithms that revolve around tree-structured translation models, including hierarchical alignment, inference for parameter estimation, translation, and structured evaluation, can be derived by generalizing two of these parameters -- the grammar and the logic. The article culminates with a recipe for using such generalized parsers to train, apply, and evaluate an SMT system that is driven by tree-structured translation models."
139,aaai,2022,Trading Complexity for Sparsity in Random Forest Explanations,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20484,"Random forests have long been considered as powerful model ensembles in machine learning. By training multiple decision trees, whose diversity is fostered through data and feature subsampling, the resulting random forest can lead to more stable and reliable predictions than a single decision tree. This however comes at the cost of decreased interpretability: while decision trees are often easily interpretable, the predictions made by random forests are much more difficult to understand, as they involve a majority vote over hundreds of decision trees. In this paper, we examine different types of reasons that explain ""why"" an input instance is classified as positive or negative by a Boolean random forest. Notably, as an alternative to sufficient reasons taking the form of prime implicants of the random forest, we introduce majoritary reasons which are prime implicants of a strict majority of decision trees. For these different abductive explanations, the tractability of the generation problem (finding one reason) and the minimization problem (finding one shortest reason) are investigated. Experiments conducted on various datasets reveal the existence of a trade-off between runtime complexity and sparsity. Sufficient reasons - for which the identification problem is DP-complete - are slightly larger than majoritary reasons that can be generated using a simple linear- time greedy algorithm, and significantly larger than minimal majoritary reasons that can be approached using an anytime P ARTIAL M AX SAT algorithm."

Beyond seeking solutions for a single task, there are surging interests in transferring network design knowledge across multiple tasks. In this line of research, effectively modeling task correlations is vital yet highly neglected. Therefore, we propose \textbf{Arch-Graph}, a transferable NAS method that predicts task-specific optimal architectures with respect to given task embeddings. It leverages correlations across multiple tasks by using their embeddings as a part of the predictor's input for fast adaptation. We also formulate NAS as an architecture relation graph prediction problem, with the relational graph constructed by treating candidate architectures as nodes and their pairwise relations as edges. To enforce some basic properties such as acyclicity in the relational graph, we add additional constraints to the optimization process, converting NAS into the problem of finding a Maximal Weighted Acyclic Subgraph (MWAS). Our algorithm then strives to eliminate cycles and only establish edges in the graph if the rank results can be trusted. Through MWAS, Arch-Graph can effectively rank candidate models for each task with only a small budget to finetune the predictor. With extensive experiments on TransNAS-Bench-101, we show Arch-Graph's transferability and high sample efficiency across numerous tasks, beating many NAS methods designed for both single-task and multi-task search. It is able to find top 0.16\% and 0.29\% architectures on average on two search spaces under the budget of only 50 models."

After an issue is reported, SREs come together in a virtual room (collaboration platform) to triage the issue. While doing so, they leave behind a wealth of information which can be used later for triaging similar issues. However, usability of the conversations offer challenges due to them being i) noisy and ii) unlabelled. This paper presents a novel approach for issue artefact extraction from the noisy conversations with minimal labelled data. We propose a combination of unsupervised and supervised model with minimum human intervention that leverages domain knowledge to predict artefacts for a small amount of conversation data and use that for fine-tuning an already pretrained language model for artefact prediction on a large amount of conversation data. Experimental results on our dataset show that the proposed ensemble of unsupervised and supervised model is better than using either one of them individually."

A misspecified or poorly designed reward can result in low sample efficiency and undesired behaviors. In this paper, we propose the idea of programmatic reward design, i.e. using programs to specify the reward functions in RL environments. Programs allow human engineers to express sub-goals and complex task scenarios in a structured and interpretable way. The challenge of programmatic reward design, however, is that while humans can provide the high-level structures, properly setting the low-level details, such as the right amount of reward for a specific sub-task, remains difficult. A major contribution of this paper is a probabilistic framework that can infer the best candidate programmatic reward function from expert demonstrations. Inspired by recent generative-adversarial approaches, our framework searches for the most likely programmatic reward function under which the optimally generated trajectories cannot be differentiated from the demonstrated trajectories. Experimental results show that programmatic reward functionslearned using this framework can significantly outperform those learned using existing reward learning algo-rithms, and enable RL agents to achieve state-of-the-artperformance on highly complex tasks."

The control law is robust, stable, and capable of controlling only the orbital geometry, allowing the spacecraft to operate with idle-thruster periods. It is entirely analytical and suitable for real-time operations. The control law is inspired by the two-body problem and uses sliding mode control theory to ensure robustness against bounded disturbances. Practical considerations, such as measurement noise, thruster limitations, and hysteresis-based control switching, are taken into account. The proposed control law is demonstrated and validated through several examples, including orbit-keeping around the asteroid Bennu, showing its feasibility and efficiency for small body missions. The results indicate that the control law can achieve precise and safe orbit maintenance with minimal fuel consumption, making it a valuable asset for autonomous space missions."

Without additional annotations, it learns to focus on discriminative elements and to align them, and simultaneously brings more invariance for classification and geometric information to refine localization. DP-FCN is composed of three main modules: a Fully Convolutional Network to efficiently maintain spatial resolution, a deformable part-based RoI pooling layer to optimize positions of parts and build invariance, and a deformation-aware localization module explicitly exploiting displacements of parts to improve accuracy of bounding box regression. We experimentally validate our model and show significant gains. DP-FCN achieves state-of-the-art performances of 83.1% and 80.9% on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 with VOC data only."

Given a video stream of point cloud observation of an articulated body under arbitrary motion, our approach discovers the unknown low-dimensional skeletal relationship that can effectively represent the movement. Then the discovered structure is utilized to encode the motion priors of dynamic sequences in a latent structure, which can be decoded to the relative joint rotations to represent the full skeletal motion. Our approach works without any prior knowledge of the underlying motion or skeletal structure, and we demonstrate that the discovered structure is even comparable to the hand-labeled ground truth skeleton in representing a 4D sequence of motion. The skeletal structure embeds the general semantics of possible motion space that can generate motions for diverse scenarios. We verify that the learned motion prior is generalizable to the multi-modal sequence generation, interpolation of two poses, and motion retargeting to a different skeletal structure."
147,aaai,2022,Achieving Zero Constraint Violation for Constrained Reinforcement Learning via Primal-Dual Approach,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20281,"Reinforcement learning is widely used in applications where one needs to perform sequential decisions while interacting with the environment. The problem becomes more challenging when the decision requirement includes satisfying some safety constraints. The problem is mathematically formulated as constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In the literature, various algorithms are available to solve CMDP problems in a model-free manner to achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with $\epsilon$ feasible policies. An $\epsilon$-feasible policy implies that it suffers from constraint violation. An important question here is whether we can achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations or not. To achieve that, we advocate the use of randomized primal-dual approach to solve the CMDP problems and propose a conservative stochastic primal-dual algorithm (CSPDA) which is shown to exhibit $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations. In the prior works, the best available sample complexity for the $\epsilon$-optimal policy with zero constraint violation is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/\epsilon^5\right)$. Hence, the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement as compared to the state of the art."

Instead of placing an existing Transformer-based image classification model directly after an image codec, we aim to redesign the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to perform image classification from the compressed features and facilitate image compression with the long-term information from the Transformer. Specifically, we first replace the patchify stem (i.e., image splitting and embedding) of the ViT model with a lightweight image encoder modelled by a convolutional neural network. The compressed features generated by the image encoder are injected convolutional inductive bias and are fed to the Transformer for image classification bypassing image reconstruction. Meanwhile, we propose a feature aggregation module to fuse the compressed features with the selected intermediate features of the Transformer, and feed the aggregated features to a deconvolutional neural network for image reconstruction. The aggregated features can obtain the long-term information from the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer and improve the compression performance. The rate-distortion-accuracy optimization problem is finally solved by a two-step training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in both the image compression and the classification tasks."
149,aaai,2022,Personalized Public Policy Analysis in Social Sciences Using Causal-Graphical Normalizing Flows,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21437,"Structural Equation/Causal Models (SEMs/SCMs) are widely used in epidemiology and social sciences to identify and analyze the average causal effect (ACE) and conditional ACE (CACE). Traditional causal effect estimation methods such as Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and more recently Regression-With-Residuals (RWR) are widely used - as they avoid the challenging task of identifying the SCM parameters - to estimate ACE and CACE. However, much work remains before traditional estimation methods can be used for counterfactual inference, and for the benefit of Personalized Public Policy Analysis (P$^3$A) in the social sciences. While doctors rely on personalized medicine to tailor treatments to patients in laboratory settings (relatively closed systems), P$^3$A draws inspiration from such tailoring but adapts it for open social systems. In this article, we develop a method for counterfactual inference that we name causal-Graphical Normalizing Flow (c-GNF), facilitating P$^3$A. First, we show how c-GNF captures the underlying SCM without making any assumption about functional forms. Second, we propose a novel dequantization trick to deal with discrete variables, which is a limitation of normalizing flows in general. Third, we demonstrate in experiments that c-GNF performs on-par with IPW and RWR in terms of bias and variance for estimating the ATE, when the true functional forms are known, and better when they are unknown. Fourth and most importantly, we conduct counterfactual inference with c-GNFs, demonstrating promising empirical performance. Because IPW and RWR, like other traditional methods, lack the capability of counterfactual inference, c-GNFs will likely play a major role in tailoring personalized treatment, facilitating P$^3$A, optimizing social interventions - in contrast to the current `one-size-fits-all' approach of existing methods."

These redshift distributions represent one of the crucial ingredients for weak gravitational lensing measurements with the KiDS-1000 data. The primary estimate is based on deep spectroscopic reference catalogues that are re-weighted with the help of a self-organising map (SOM) to closely resemble the KiDS-1000 sources, split into five tomographic redshift bins in the photometric redshift range $0.1<z_\mathrm{B}\le1.2$. Sources are selected such that they only occupy that volume of nine-dimensional magnitude-space that is also covered by the reference samples (`gold' selection). Residual biases in the mean redshifts determined from this calibration are estimated from mock catalogues to be $\lesssim0.01$ for all five bins with uncertainties of $\sim 0.01$. This primary SOM estimate of the KiDS-1000 redshift distributions is complemented with an independent clustering redshift approach. After validation of the clustering-$z$ on the same mock catalogues and a careful assessment of systematic errors, we find no significant bias of the SOM redshift distributions with respect to the clustering-$z$ measurements. The SOM redshift distributions re-calibrated by the clustering-$z$ represent an alternative calibration of the redshift distributions with only slightly larger uncertainties in the mean redshifts of $\sim 0.01-0.02$ to be used in KiDS-1000 cosmological weak lensing analyses. As this includes the SOM uncertainty, clustering-$z$ are shown to be fully competitive on KiDS-1000 data."

For contemporary massive data sets, RAM-based algorithms become impractical. And although there exist good sequential algorithms for k-center, they are not easily parallelizable.   In this paper, we design and implement parallel approximation algorithms for this problem. We observe that Gonzalez's greedy algorithm can be efficiently parallelized in several MapReduce rounds; in practice, we find that two rounds are sufficient, leading to a 4-approximation. We contrast this with an existing parallel algorithm for k-center that runs in a constant number of rounds, and offers a 10-approximation. In depth runtime analysis reveals that this scheme is often slow, and that its sampling procedure only runs if k is sufficiently small, relative to the input size. To trade off runtime for approximation guarantee, we parameterize this sampling algorithm, and find in our experiments that the algorithm is not only faster, but sometimes more effective. Yet the parallel version of Gonzalez is about 100 times faster than both its sequential version and the parallel sampling algorithm, barely compromising solution quality."

However, it remains unclear how to make use of these detailed learning behavior data to improve the design of learning materials and gain deeper insight into students' thinking and learning styles. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system to analyze student learning behaviors on a K-12 mathematics E-learning platform.

Recent studies have shown that they can be manipulated by malicious adversaries to produce arbitrary desired explanations. However, existing attacks focus solely on altering the black-box model itself. In this paper, we propose a complementary family of attacks that leave the model intact and manipulate SHAP explanations using stealthily biased sampling of the data points used to approximate expectations w.r.t the background distribution. In the context of fairness audit, we show that our attack can reduce the importance of a sensitive feature when explaining the difference in outcomes between groups while remaining undetected. More precisely, experiments performed on real-world datasets showed that our attack could yield up to a 90\% relative decrease in amplitude of the sensitive feature attribution. These results highlight the manipulability of SHAP explanations and encourage auditors to treat them with skepticism."

The goal of the reward designer is to modify the underlying reward function cost-efficiently while ensuring that any approximately optimal deterministic policy under the new reward function is admissible and performs well under the original reward function. This problem can be viewed as a dual to the problem of optimal reward poisoning attacks: instead of forcing an agent to adopt a specific policy, the reward designer incentivizes an agent to avoid taking actions that are inadmissible in certain states. Perhaps surprisingly, and in contrast to the problem of optimal reward poisoning attacks, we first show that the reward design problem for admissible policy teaching is computationally challenging, and it is NP-hard to find an approximately optimal reward modification. We then proceed by formulating a surrogate problem whose optimal solution approximates the optimal solution to the reward design problem in our setting, but is more amenable to optimization techniques and analysis. For this surrogate problem, we present characterization results that provide bounds on the value of the optimal solution. Finally, we design a local search algorithm to solve the surrogate problem and showcase its utility using simulation-based experiments."

However, if some agents deviate from their prescribed programs and a security property is violated, it is important to hold agents accountable by determining which deviations actually caused the violation. Motivated by these applications, we initiate a formal study of program actions as actual causes. Specifically, we define in an interacting program model what it means for a set of program actions to be an actual cause of a violation. We present a sound technique for establishing program actions as actual causes. We demonstrate the value of this formalism in two ways. First, we prove that violations of a specific class of safety properties always have an actual cause. Thus, our definition applies to relevant security properties. Second, we provide a cause analysis of a representative protocol designed to address weaknesses in the current public key certification infrastructure."

An existing approach combines techniques from LTL synthesis with optimization for the DS rewards but has failed to yield a sound algorithm. An alternative approach combining LTL synthesis with satisficing DS rewards (rewards that achieve a threshold) is sound and complete for integer discount factors, but, in practice, a fractional discount factor is desired. This work extends the existing satisficing approach, presenting the first sound algorithm for synthesis from LTL and DS rewards with fractional discount factors.

The goods arrive online in a sequence of $T$ time periods. The agents' values for a good are revealed only after its arrival, and the online algorithm needs to fractionally allocate the good, immediately and irrevocably, among the agents. Towards a unifying treatment of fairness and economic efficiency objectives, we develop an algorithmic framework for finding online allocations to maximize the generalized mean of the values received by the agents. In particular, working with the assumption that each agent's value for the grand bundle of goods is appropriately scaled, we address online maximization of $p$-mean welfare. Parameterized by an exponent term $p \in (-\infty, 1]$, these means encapsulate a range of welfare functions, including social welfare ($p=1$), egalitarian welfare ($p \to -\infty$), and Nash social welfare ($p \to 0$).   We present a simple algorithmic template that takes a threshold as input and, with judicious choices for this threshold, leads to both universal and tailored competitive guarantees. First, we show that one can compute online a single allocation that $O (\sqrt{n} \log n)$-approximates the optimal $p$-mean welfare for all $p\le 1$. The existence of such a universal allocation is interesting in and of itself. Moreover, this universal guarantee achieves essentially tight competitive ratios for specific values of $p$.   Next, we obtain improved competitive ratios for different ranges of $p$ by executing our algorithm with $p$-specific thresholds, e.g., we provide $O(\log ^3 n)$-competitive ratio for all $p\in (\frac{-1}{\log 2n},1)$.   We complement our positive results by establishing lower bounds to show that our guarantees are essentially tight for a wide range of the exponent parameter."
159,aaai,2022,Truthful and Fair Mechanisms for Matroid-Rank Valuations,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20407,"We revisit the classic problem of fair division from a mechanism design perspective, using {\em Proportional Fairness} as a benchmark. In particular, we aim to allocate a collection of divisible items to a set of agents while incentivizing the agents to be truthful in reporting their valuations. For the very large class of homogeneous valuations, we design a truthful mechanism that provides {\em every agent} with at least a $1/e\approx 0.368$ fraction of her Proportionally Fair valuation. To complement this result, we show that no truthful mechanism can guarantee more than a $0.5$ fraction, even for the restricted class of additive linear valuations. We also propose another mechanism for additive linear valuations that works really well when every item is highly demanded. To guarantee truthfulness, our mechanisms discard a carefully chosen fraction of the allocated resources; we conclude by uncovering interesting connections between our mechanisms and known mechanisms that use money instead."
160,aaai,2022,Latent Space Simulation for Carbon Capture Design Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21511,"The CO2 capture efficiency in solvent-based carbon capture systems (CCSs) critically depends on the gas-solvent interfacial area (IA), making maximization of IA a foundational challenge in CCS design. While the IA associated with a particular CCS design can be estimated via a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, using CFD to derive the IAs associated with numerous CCS designs is prohibitively costly. Fortunately, previous works such as Deep Fluids (DF) (Kim et al., 2019) show that large simulation speedups are achievable by replacing CFD simulators with neural network (NN) surrogates that faithfully mimic the CFD simulation process. This raises the possibility of a fast, accurate replacement for a CFD simulator and therefore efficient approximation of the IAs required by CCS design optimization. Thus, here, we build on the DF approach to develop surrogates that can successfully be applied to our complex carbon-capture CFD simulations. Our optimized DF-style surrogates produce large speedups (4000x) while obtaining IA relative errors as low as 4% on unseen CCS configurations that lie within the range of training configurations. This hints at the promise of NN surrogates for our CCS design optimization problem. Nonetheless, DF has inherent limitations with respect to CCS design (e.g., limited transferability of trained models to new CCS packings). We conclude with ideas to address these challenges."

FAFs comprise update frameworks which empower (human or artificial) agents to argue over time about the probability of outcomes, e.g. the winner of a political election or a fluctuation in inflation rates, whilst flagging perceived irrationality in the agents' behaviour with a view to improving their forecasting accuracy. FAFs include five argument types, amounting to standard pro/con arguments, as in bipolar argumentation, as well as novel proposal arguments and increase/decrease amendment arguments. We adapt an existing gradual semantics for bipolar argumentation to determine the aggregated dialectical strength of proposal arguments and define irrational behaviour. We then give a simple aggregation function which produces a final group forecast from rational agents' individual forecasts. We identify and study properties of FAFs and conduct an empirical evaluation which signals FAFs' potential to increase the forecasting accuracy of participants."

Going beyond local queries, we allow transitive closure over roles. We focus on ontologies formulated in the description logics ALCOI and ALCOQ, extended with transitive closure. For both logics, we show 2EXPTIME upper bounds for finite entailment of unions of conjunctive queries with transitive closure. We also provide a matching lower bound by showing that finite entailment of conjunctive queries with transitive closure in ALC is 2EXPTIME-hard."

For knowledge bases in the basic description logic ALC, the computational complexity of conjunctive query (CQ) answering is well known to be ExpTime-complete and hence not harder than satisfiability. This does not change when the logic is extended by certain features (such as counting or role hierarchies), whereas adding others (inverses, nominals or transitivity together with role-hierarchies) turns CQ answering exponentially harder. We contribute to this line of results by showing the surprising fact that even extending ALC by just the Self operator - which proved innocuous in many other contexts - increases the complexity of CQ entailment to 2ExpTime. As common for this type of problem, our proof establishes a reduction from alternating Turing machines running in exponential space, but several novel ideas and encoding tricks are required to make the approach work in that specific, restricted setting."
164,aaai,2022,Making Translations to Classical Planning Competitive with Other HTN Planners,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21203,"Many planning techniques have been developed to allow autonomous systems to act and make decisions based on their perceptions of the environment. Among these techniques, HTN ({\it Hierarchical Task Network}) planning is one of the most used in practice. Unlike classical approaches of planning. HTN operates by decomposing task into sub-tasks until each of these sub-tasks can be achieved an action. This hierarchical representation provide a richer representation of planning problems and allows to better guide the plan search and provides more knowledge to the underlying algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new approach of HTN planning in which, as in conventional planning, we instantiate all planning operators before starting the search process. This approach has proven its effectiveness in classical planning and is necessary for the development of effective heuristics and encoding planning problems in other formalism such as CSP or SAT. The instantiation is actually used by most modern planners but has never been applied in an HTN based planning framework. We present in this article a generic instantiation algorithm which implements many simplification techniques to reduce the process complexity inspired from those used in classical planning. Finally we present some results obtained from an experimentation on a range of problems used in the international planning competitions with a modified version of SHOP planner using fully instantiated problems."

In this paper, we study a public goods variant of the problem, where instead of competing with one another for the cake, the agents all share the same subset of the cake which must be chosen subject to a length constraint. We focus on the design of truthful and fair mechanisms in the presence of strategic agents who have piecewise uniform utilities over the cake. On the one hand, we show that the leximin solution is truthful and moreover maximizes an egalitarian welfare measure among all truthful and position oblivious mechanisms. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the maximum Nash welfare solution is truthful for two agents but not in general. Our results assume that mechanisms can block each agent from accessing parts that the agent does not claim to desire; we provide an impossibility result when blocking is not allowed."

The algorithm is expected to make an irrevocable decision with regard to each request based only on the observed history. We consider the following natural extension of this model: each request arrives k times, and the arrival order is a random permutation of the kn arrivals; the algorithm is expected to make a decision regarding each request only upon its last arrival. We focus primarily on the case when k=2, which can also be interpreted as each request arriving at, and departing from the system, at a random time. We examine the secretary problem: the problem of selecting the best secretary when the secretaries are presented online according to a random permutation. We show that when each secretary arrives twice, we can achieve a competitive ratio of ~0.768 (compared to 1/e in the classical secretary problem), and that it is optimal. We also show that without any knowledge about the number of secretaries or their arrival times, we can still hire the best secretary with probability at least 2/3, in contrast to the impossibility of achieving a constant success probability in the classical setting. We extend our results to the matroid secretary problem, introduced by Babaioff et al., (2007) and show a simple algorithm that achieves a 2-approximation to the maximal weighted basis in the new model (for k=2). We show that this approximation factor can be improved in special cases of the matroid secretary problem; in particular, we give a 16/9-competitive algorithm for the returning edge-weighted bipartite matching problem."

Upon request, automated vehicles must be able to explain their decisions to the driver and the car passengers, to the pedestrians and other vulnerable road users and potentially to external auditors in case of accidents. However, nowadays, most explainable methods still rely on quantitative analysis of the AD scene representations captured by multiple sensors. This paper proposes a novel representation of AD scenes, called Qualitative eXplainable Graph (QXG), dedicated to qualitative spatiotemporal reasoning of long-term scenes. The construction of this graph exploits the recent Qualitative Constraint Acquisition paradigm. Our experimental results on NuScenes, an open real-world multi-modal dataset, show that the qualitative eXplainable graph of an AD scene composed of 40 frames can be computed in real-time and light in space storage which makes it a potentially interesting tool for improved and more trustworthy perception and control processes in AD."

Scene-aware dialog systems for real-world applications could be developed by integrating state-of-the-art technologies from multiple research areas, including: end-to-end dialog technologies, which generate system responses using models trained from dialog data; visual question answering (VQA) technologies, which answer questions about images using learned image features; and video description technologies, in which descriptions/captions are generated from videos using multimodal information. We introduce a new dataset of dialogs about videos of human behaviors. Each dialog is a typed conversation that consists of a sequence of 10 question-and-answer(QA) pairs between two Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers. In total, we collected dialogs on roughly 9,000 videos. Using this new dataset for Audio Visual Scene-aware dialog (AVSD), we trained an end-to-end conversation model that generates responses in a dialog about a video. Our experiments demonstrate that using multimodal features that were developed for multimodal attention-based video description enhances the quality of generated dialog about dynamic scenes (videos). Our dataset, model code and pretrained models will be publicly available for a new Video Scene-Aware Dialog challenge."

However, there is a growing need for smaller, energy-efficient, neural networks tobe able to use machine learning applications on devices with limited computational resources. A popular approach consists of using pruning techniques. While these techniques have traditionally focused on pruning pre-trained NN (LeCun et al.,1990; Hassibi et al., 1993), recent work by Lee et al. (2018) has shown promising results when pruning at initialization. However, for Deep NNs, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, they do not prevent one layer from being fully pruned. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of Magnitude and Gradient based pruning at initialization and training of sparse architectures. This allows us to propose novel principled approaches which we validate experimentally on a variety of NN architectures."

Classification of time-series images, particularly with recursive methods, is of increasing interest in the current literature. Nevertheless, existing recursive approaches typically require large amounts of training data. This paper introduces a recursive classification framework that improves the decision-making process in multitemporal and multispectral land cover classification algorithms while requiring low computational cost and minimal supervision. The proposed approach allows the conversion of an instantaneous classifier into a recursive Bayesian classifier by using a probabilistic framework that is robust to non-informative image variations. Three experiments are conducted using Sentinel-2 data. The first one consists in the water mapping of an embankment dam in California (United States), the second one is a land cover classification experiment of the Charles river area in Boston (United States) and the last experiment addresses deforestation detection in the Amazon rainforest (Brazil). A classifier based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), a logistic regression (LR) classifier, and a spectral index classifier (SIC) are compared to their recursive counterparts. SICs are introduced to convert the NDWI, MNDWI and NDVI spectral indices into predictive probabilities. Two state-of-the-art deep learning-based models are also used as a benchmark for the water mapping experiment. Results show that the proposed method significantly increases the robustness of existing instantaneous classifiers in multitemporal settings. Our method also improves the performance of deep learning-based classifiers without the need for additional training data."
171,aaai,2022,A Fast Algorithm for PAC Combinatorial Pure Exploration,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20553,"We consider the problem of Combinatorial Pure Exploration (CPE), which deals with finding a combinatorial set or arms with a high reward, when the rewards of individual arms are unknown in advance and must be estimated using arm pulls. Previous algorithms for this problem, while obtaining sample complexity reductions in many cases, are highly computationally intensive, thus making them impractical even for mildly large problems. In this work, we propose a new CPE algorithm in the PAC setting, which is computationally light weight, and so can easily be applied to problems with tens of thousands of arms. This is achieved since the proposed algorithm requires a very small number of combinatorial oracle calls. The algorithm is based on successive acceptance of arms, along with elimination which is based on the combinatorial structure of the problem. We provide sample complexity guarantees for our algorithm, and demonstrate in experiments its usefulness on large problems, whereas previous algorithms are impractical to run on problems of even a few dozen arms. The code for the algorithms and experiments is provided at https://github.com/noabdavid/csale."

However, in real-world systems, dissatisfied users may depart (and never come back). In this work, we propose a novel multi-armed bandit setup that captures such policy-dependent horizons. Our setup consists of a finite set of user types, and multiple arms with Bernoulli payoffs. Each (user type, arm) tuple corresponds to an (unknown) reward probability. Each user's type is initially unknown and can only be inferred through their response to recommendations. Moreover, if a user is dissatisfied with their recommendation, they might depart the system. We first address the case where all users share the same type, demonstrating that a recent UCB-based algorithm is optimal. We then move forward to the more challenging case, where users are divided among two types. While naive approaches cannot handle this setting, we provide an efficient learning algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, where $T$ is the number of users."

These studies show that modern cryptographic devices are increasingly threatened by side-channel attacks with the help of deep learning. However, the existing countermeasures are designed to resist classical side-channel attacks, and cannot protect cryptographic devices from deep learning based side-channel attacks. Thus, there arises a strong need for countermeasures against deep learning based side-channel attacks. Although deep learning has the high potential in solving complex problems, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrectly.   In this paper, we propose a kind of novel countermeasures based on adversarial attacks that is specifically designed against deep learning based side-channel attacks. We estimate several models commonly used in deep learning based side-channel attacks to evaluate the proposed countermeasures. It shows that our approach can effectively protect cryptographic devices from deep learning based side-channel attacks in practice. In addition, our experiments show that the new countermeasures can also resist classical side-channel attacks."

The current state of the art is that no setting where EFX allocations are impossible is known, and EFX is known to exist for ($i$) agents with identical valuations, ($ii$) 2 agents, ($iii$) 3 agents with additive valuations, ($iv$) agents with one of two additive valuations and ($v$) agents with two-valued instances. It is also known that EFX exists if one can leave $n-1$ items unallocated, where $n$ is the number of agents.   We develop new techniques that allow us to push the boundaries of the enigmatic EFX problem beyond these known results, and, arguably, to simplify proofs of earlier results. Our main results are ($i$) every setting with 4 additive agents admits an EFX allocation that leaves at most a single item unallocated, ($ii$) every setting with $n$ additive valuations has an EFX allocation with at most $n-2$ unallocated items.   Moreover, all of our results extend beyond additive valuations to all nice cancelable valuations (a new class, including additive, unit-demand, budget-additive and multiplicative valuations, among others). Furthermore, using our new techniques, we show that previous results for additive valuations extend to nice cancelable valuations."

Our framework inherits from recent advances in Bayesian deep learning, and extends existing work by considering the targeted crowdsourcing approach, where multiple annotators with unknown expertise contribute an uncontrolled amount (often limited) of annotations. Our framework leverages the low-rank structure in annotations to learn individual annotator expertise, which then helps to infer the true labels from noisy and sparse annotations. It provides a unified Bayesian model to simultaneously infer the true labels and train the deep learning model in order to reach an optimal learning efficacy. Finally, our framework exploits the uncertainty of the deep learning model during prediction as well as the annotators' estimated expertise to minimize the number of required annotations and annotators for optimally training the deep learning model.   We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework for intent classification in Alexa (Amazon's personal assistant), using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experiments show that our framework can accurately learn annotator expertise, infer true labels, and effectively reduce the amount of annotations in model training as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We further discuss the potential of our proposed framework in bridging machine learning and crowdsourcing towards improved human-in-the-loop systems."

Diversity is greater when the errors of the ensemble prediction is more uniformly distributed. Greater diversity is highly correlated with the increase in ensemble accuracy. Another attractive property of diversity optimized ensemble learning is its robustness against deception: an adversarial perturbation attack can mislead one DNN model to misclassify but may not fool other ensemble DNN members consistently. In this paper we first give an overview of the concept of ensemble diversity and examine the three types of ensemble diversity in the context of DNN classifiers. We then describe a set of ensemble diversity measures, a suite of algorithms for creating diversity ensembles and for performing ensemble consensus (voted or learned) for generating high accuracy ensemble output by strategically combining outputs of individual members. This paper concludes with a discussion on a set of open issues in quantifying ensemble diversity for robust deep learning."

The advantages of this approach are twofold. First, legal reasoning can be performed on the basis of the binary tree representation of the regulations. Second, the binary tree representation of the regulations is more understandable than the existing sentence-based representations. We provide an example of how our approach can be used to interpret the regulations in a legal document."

First, we develop a new technique to verify the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality in a neighborhood of the global minimizers, which leads to a local linear convergence region for the gradient descent method. Second, based on the local convergence result and a sharp strict saddle property proven in this paper, we present two new conditions that guarantee the global linear convergence of the perturbed gradient descent method. The developed local and global convergence results provide much stronger theoretical guarantees than the existing results. As a by-product, this work significantly improves the existing bounds on the RIP constant required to guarantee the non-existence of spurious solutions."

Currently, attention-based encoder-decoder models are widely used in this task. They typically generate target sequences in a left-to-right (L2R) manner, leaving the right-to-left (R2L) contexts unexploited. In this paper, we propose an Attention aggregation based Bi-directional Mutual learning Network (ABM) which consists of one shared encoder and two parallel inverse decoders (L2R and R2L). The two decoders are enhanced via mutual distillation, which involves one-to-one knowledge transfer at each training step, making full use of the complementary information from two inverse directions. Moreover, in order to deal with mathematical symbols in diverse scales, an Attention Aggregation Module (AAM) is proposed to effectively integrate multi-scale coverage attentions. Notably, in the inference phase, given that the model already learns knowledge from two inverse directions, we only use the L2R branch for inference, keeping the original parameter size and inference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the recognition accuracy of 56.85 % on CROHME 2014, 52.92 % on CROHME 2016, and 53.96 % on CROHME 2019 without data augmentation and model ensembling, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

Unfortunately, current deep networks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge devices, but also too large for communicating updates over bandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and experimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse Training (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained with substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and in-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that extracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this scheme, ""two birds are killed with one stone:"" instead of full models, each client performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse networks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly accommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse masks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an ""in-time self-ensembling effect"" into the training dynamics and improves the FL performance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d. FL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our experiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it gains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same upload data cap; the accuracy gap remains 3% even when FedAvgM is given 2x the upload data cap, further demonstrating efficacy of FedDST.

However, existing approaches lack interpretability, compromise on data utility and fail to provide privacy guarantees. Thus, the goal of my doctoral research is to develop interpretable approaches towards privacy preservation of text representations that retain data utility while guaranteeing privacy. To this end, I aim to study and develop methods to incorporate steganographic modifications within the vector geometry to obfuscate underlying spurious associations and preserve the distributional semantic properties learnt during training."

In this work, we apply frequency domain learning and optimal transport theory in knowledge distillation (KD) to specifically improve the detection of low-quality compressed deepfake images. We explore transfer learning capability in KD to enable a student network to learn discriminative features from low-quality images effectively. In particular, we propose the Attention-based Deepfake detection Distiller (ADD), which consists of two novel distillations: 1) frequency attention distillation that effectively retrieves the removed high-frequency components in the student network, and 2) multi-view attention distillation that creates multiple attention vectors by slicing the teacher's and student's tensors under different views to transfer the teacher tensor's distribution to the student more efficiently. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detecting low-quality compressed deepfake images."
187,aaai,2022,Robust and Resource-Efficient Data-Free Knowledge Distillation by Generative Pseudo Replay,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20556,"Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (KD) allows knowledge transfer from a trained neural network (teacher) to a more compact one (student) in the absence of original training data. Existing works use a validation set to monitor the accuracy of the student over real data and report the highest performance throughout the entire process. However, validation data may not be available at distillation time either, making it infeasible to record the student snapshot that achieved the peak accuracy. Therefore, a practical data-free KD method should be robust and ideally provide monotonically increasing student accuracy during distillation. This is challenging because the student experiences knowledge degradation due to the distribution shift of the synthetic data. A straightforward approach to overcome this issue is to store and rehearse the generated samples periodically, which increases the memory footprint and creates privacy concerns. We propose to model the distribution of the previously observed synthetic samples with a generative network. In particular, we design a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a training objective that is customized to learn the synthetic data representations optimally. The student is rehearsed by the generative pseudo replay technique, with samples produced by the VAE. Hence knowledge degradation can be prevented without storing any samples. Experiments on image classification benchmarks show that our method optimizes the expected value of the distilled model accuracy while eliminating the large memory overhead incurred by the sample-storing methods."

When the probabilities of connections do not scale with the size of the graph, we show that under the NCOND condition, a simple max-weight type policy allows to attain an asymptotically perfect matching while no sequential algorithm attain perfect matching otherwise. The proof relies on a specific Markovian representation of the dynamics associated with Lyapunov techniques."

The state-of-the-art performance of a neural network depends also on the perfect choice of an activation function. We propose two novel non-monotonic smooth trainable activation functions, called ErfAct and Pserf. Experiments suggest that the proposed functions improve the network performance significantly compared to the widely used activations like ReLU, Swish, and Mish. Replacing ReLU by ErfAct and Pserf, we have 5.68% and 5.42% improvement for top-1 accuracy on Shufflenet V2 (2.0x) network in CIFAR100 dataset, 2.11% and 1.96% improvement for top-1 accuracy on Shufflenet V2 (2.0x) network in CIFAR10 dataset, 1.0%, and 1.0% improvement on mean average precision (mAP) on SSD300 model in Pascal VOC dataset."

We would like our AI agents to effectively collaborate in a similar way by capturing a model of their partners. In this work, we propose and analyze a decentralized Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with coupled rewards as an abstraction of more general multi-agent collaboration. We demonstrate that na\""ive extensions of single-agent optimal MAB algorithms fail when applied for decentralized bandit teams. Instead, we propose a Partner-Aware strategy for joint sequential decision-making that extends the well-known single-agent Upper Confidence Bound algorithm. We analytically show that our proposed strategy achieves logarithmic regret, and provide extensive experiments involving human-AI and human-robot collaboration to validate our theoretical findings. Our results show that the proposed partner-aware strategy outperforms other known methods, and our human subject studies suggest humans prefer to collaborate with AI agents implementing our partner-aware strategy."

Previous work in AI ethics literacy have developed curriculum and classroom activities that engage learners in reflecting on the ethical implications of AI systems and developing responsible AI. There is little work in using game-based learning methods in AI literacy. Games are known to be compelling media to teach children about complex STEM concepts. In this work, we developed a competitive card game for middle and high school students called ""AI Audit"" where they play as AI start-up founders building novel AI-powered technology. Players can challenge other players with potential harms of their technology or defend their own businesses by features that mitigate these harms. The game mechanics reward systems that are ethically developed or that take steps to mitigate potential harms. In this paper, we present the game design, teacher resources for classroom deployment and early playtesting results. We discuss our reflections about using games as teaching tools for AI literacy in K-12 classrooms."

The structure of local society may be well described by social network analysis. We have investigated the role of hubs within that concept. In case of danger, there are two different strategies of information management: 1) information spread that leads to awareness of the whole society 2) keeping the whole information in secret under control that leads to a partial social awareness, available to a small number of people only. In our model, the probability of information spread between two nodes is inverse proportional to connectivity of the next node because people who have a lot of connections are more immune. We have applied agent-based modelling on Barabasi Albert networks to explore various scenarios of information spread. We have considered recent arsenic environmental danger in G{\l}og\'ow and Legnica (Copper Basin) according to the official available data (2015 - 2016) from social network analysis point of view. We have considered various levels of environmental danger. Despite blocking of information by hubs, the successful information spread is possible when levels of danger are high enough. The perception and impression of information spread by society is also."

However, people deliberately use these linguistic taboos and other language constructs to make hurtful, derogatory, and obscene comments. It is nearly impossible to construct a universal set of offensive or taboo terms because offensiveness is determined entirely by different factors such as socio-physical setting, speaker-listener relationship, and word choices. In this paper, we present a detailed corpus-based study of offensive language in Nepali. We identify and describe more than 18 different categories of linguistic offenses including politics, religion, race, and sex. We discuss 12 common euphemisms such as synonym, metaphor and circumlocution. In addition, we introduce a manually constructed data set of over 1000 offensive and taboo terms popular among contemporary speakers. This in-depth study of offensive language and resource will provide a foundation for several downstream tasks such as offensive language detection and language learning."

However, most existing graph classification problems with GNNs follow the protocol of balanced data splitting, which misaligns with many real-world scenarios in which some classes have much fewer labels than others. Directly training GNNs under this imbalanced scenario may lead to uninformative representations of graphs in minority classes, and compromise the overall classification performance, which signifies the importance of developing effective GNNs towards handling imbalanced graph classification. Existing methods are either tailored for non-graph structured data or designed specifically for imbalanced node classification while few focus on imbalanced graph classification. To this end, we introduce a novel framework, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks (G$^2$GNN), which alleviates the graph imbalance issue by deriving extra supervision globally from neighboring graphs and locally from stochastic augmentations of graphs. Globally, we construct a graph of graphs (GoG) based on kernel similarity and perform GoG propagation to aggregate neighboring graph representations. Locally, we employ topological augmentation via masking node features or dropping edges with self-consistency regularization to generate stochastic augmentations of each graph that improve the model generalibility. Extensive graph classification experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate our proposed G$^2$GNN outperforms numerous baselines by roughly 5\% in both F1-macro and F1-micro scores. The implementation of G$^2$GNN is available at https://github.com/YuWVandy/G2GNN}{https://github.com/YuWVandy/G2GNN"

ACM '21] outlines the existence and the fatal impact of collusion rings in academic peer reviewing. We introduce and analyze the problem Cycle-Free Reviewing that aims at finding a review assignment without the following kind of collusion ring: A sequence of reviewers each reviewing a paper authored by the next reviewer in the sequence (with the last reviewer reviewing a paper of the first), thus creating a review cycle where each reviewer gives favorable reviews. As a result, all papers in that cycle have a high chance of acceptance independent of their respective scientific merit.   We observe that review assignments computed using a standard Linear Programming approach typically admit many short review cycles. On the negative side, we show that Cycle-Free Reviewing is NP-hard in various restricted cases (i.e., when every author is qualified to review all papers and one wants to prevent that authors review each other's or their own papers or when every author has only one paper and is only qualified to review few papers). On the positive side, among others, we show that, in some realistic settings, an assignment without any review cycles of small length always exists. This result also gives rise to an efficient heuristic for computing (weighted) cycle-free review assignments, which we show to be of excellent quality in practice."

[AAAI 2020], we contribute further theoretical insights into adapting stable two-sided matchings to change. Moreover, we perform extensive empirical studies hinting at numerous practically useful properties. Our theoretical extensions include the study of new problems (that is, incremental variants of Almost Stable Marriage and Hospital Residents), focusing on their (parameterized) computational complexity and the equivalence of various change types (thus simplifying algorithmic and complexity-theoretic studies for various natural change scenarios). Our experimental findings reveal, for instance, that allowing the new matching to be blocked by a few pairs significantly decreases the necessary differences between the old and the new stable matching."
197,aaai,2022,A Calculus for Computing Structured Justifications for Election Outcomes,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20414,"Multi-winner approval elections are seen in a variety of settings ranging from academic societies and associations to public elections. In such elections, it is often the case that ballot-length restrictions are enforced; that is, where voters have a limit on the number of candidates which they can vote for. Despite this common feature, there does not seem to be any theoretical justification for ballot-length restrictions (Laslier and Van der Straeten, 2016).   This work endogenously derives the set of voter best-response ballot lengths under complete information and with general assumptions on voter utilities and voting rules. These results provide justification for some ballot-length restrictions observed in practice, however when considering equilibrium outcomes our analysis shows that this justification is no longer valid. Equilibrium analysis is considered for voters with lazy and truth-bias second-order tendencies and the equilibrium solution concept is pure-Nash equilibria.   The key insights show that ballot-length restrictions or institutional features which make voting costly may lead to instability in election outcomes when voters have diverse preferences, via the non-existence of equilibria. On the other hand, when equilibria do exist they satisfy desirable properties which are not guaranteed by equilibria attained under costless voting and in the absence of ballot-length restrictions. In summary our results highlight a stark trade-off between stable and desirable election outcomes."

In behavior prediction research, interactive behavior prediction is a less-explored area, compared to single-agent behavior prediction. Predicting the motion of interactive agents requires initiating novel mechanisms to capture the joint behaviors of the interactive pairs. In this work, we formulate the end-to-end joint prediction problem as a sequential learning process of marginal learning and joint learning of vehicle behaviors. We propose ProspectNet, a joint learning block that adopts the weighted attention score to model the mutual influence between interactive agent pairs. The joint learning block first weighs the multi-modal predicted candidate trajectories, then updates the ego-agent's embedding via cross attention. Furthermore, we broadcast the individual future predictions for each interactive agent into a pair-wise scoring module to select the top $K$ prediction pairs. We show that ProspectNet outperforms the Cartesian product of two marginal predictions, and achieves comparable performance on the Waymo Interactive Motion Prediction benchmarks."

Standard planning languages make closed-domain and closed-world assumptions. Here we address open-world state constraints formalized by planning over a description logic (DL) ontology. Previously, this combination of DL and planning has been investigated for the light-weight DL DL-Lite. Here we propose a novel compilation scheme into standard PDDL with derived predicates, which applies to more expressive DLs and is based on the rewritability of DL queries into Datalog with stratified negation. We also provide a new rewritability result for the DL Horn-ALCHOIQ, which allows us to apply our compilation scheme to quite expressive ontologies. In contrast, we show that in the slight extension Horn-SROIQ no such compilation is possible unless the weak exponential hierarchy collapses. Finally, we show that our approach can outperform previous work on existing benchmarks for planning with DL ontologies, and is feasible on new benchmarks taking advantage of more expressive ontologies. That is an extended version of a paper accepted at AAAI 22."

There is a strong demand for a smartly assisted process automation (IPA: intelligent process automation) service that enables even general users to easily use advanced automation. A natural language interface for such automation is expected as an elemental technology for the IPA realization. The workflow targeted by IPA is generally composed of a combination of multiple tasks. However, semantic parsing, one of the natural language processing methods, for such complex workflows has not yet been fully studied. The reasons are that (1) the formal expression and grammar of the workflow required for semantic analysis have not been sufficiently examined and (2) the dataset of the workflow formal expression with its corresponding natural language description required for learning workflow semantics did not exist. This paper defines a new grammar for complex workflows with chaining machine-executable meaning representations for semantic parsing. The representations are at a high abstraction level. Additionally, an approach to creating datasets is proposed based on this grammar."

Despite its mention in one of John McCarthy's earliest papers and years of work by dedicated researchers, arguably no AI system with a serious amount of general common sense has ever emerged. Why is that? What's missing? Examples of AI systems' failures of common sense abound, and they point to AI's frequent focus on expertise as the cause. Those attempting to break the resulting brittleness barrier, even in the context of modern deep learning, have tended to invest their energy in large numbers of small bits of commonsense knowledge. While important, all the commonsense knowledge fragments in the world don't add up to a system that actually demonstrates common sense in a human-like way. We advocate examining common sense from a broader perspective than in the past. Common sense should be considered in the context of a full cognitive system with history, goals, desires, and drives, not just in isolated circumscribed examples. A fresh look is needed: common sense is worthy of its own dedicated scientific exploration."

We consider a sharing concept allowing resources being shared with social network neighbors of the resource owners. To this end, we introduce a formal model that allows a central authority to compute an optimal sharing between neighbors based on an initial allocation. Advocating this point of view, we focus on the most basic scenario where a resource may be shared by two neighbors in a social network and each agent can participate in a bounded number of sharings. We present algorithms for optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian social welfare of allocations and for reducing the number of envious agents. In particular, we examine the computational complexity with respect to several natural parameters. Furthermore, we study cases with restricted social network structures and, among others, devise polynomial-time algorithms in path- and tree-like (hierarchical) social networks."
204,aaai,2022,Fixation Maximization in the Positional Moran Process,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21160,"The Moran process is a classic stochastic process that models invasion dynamics on graphs. A single ""mutant"" (e.g., a new opinion, strain, social trait etc.) invades a population of residents spread over the nodes of a graph. The mutant fitness advantage $\delta\geq 0$ determines how aggressively mutants propagate to their neighbors. The quantity of interest is the fixation probability, i.e., the probability that the initial mutant eventually takes over the whole population. However, in realistic settings, the invading mutant has an advantage only in certain locations. E.g., a bacterial mutation allowing for lactose metabolism only confers an advantage on places where dairy products are present. In this paper we introduce the positional Moran process, a natural generalization in which the mutant fitness advantage is only realized on specific nodes called active nodes. The associated optimization problem is fixation maximization: given a budget $k$, choose a set of $k$ active nodes that maximize the fixation probability of the invading mutant. We show that the problem is NP-hard, while the optimization function is not submodular, thus indicating strong computational hardness. Then we focus on two natural limits. In the limit of $\delta\to\infty$ (strong selection), although the problem remains NP-hard, the optimization function becomes submodular and thus admits a constant-factor approximation using a simple greedy algorithm. In the limit of $\delta\to 0$ (weak selection), we show that in $O(m^\omega)$ time we can obtain a tight approximation, where $m$ is the number of edges and $\omega$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of the new algorithms together with some proposed heuristics."

Most of the liquid democracy literature and implementations allow each voter to nominate only one delegate per election. However, if that delegate abstains, the voting rights assigned to her are left unused. To minimise the number of unused delegations, it has been suggested that each voter should declare a personal ranking over voters she trusts. In this paper, we show that even if personal rankings over voters are declared, the standard delegation method of liquid democracy remains problematic. More specifically, we show that when personal rankings over voters are declared, it could be undesirable to receive delegated voting rights, which is contrary to what liquid democracy fundamentally relies on. To solve this issue, we propose a new method to delegate voting rights in an election, called breadth-first delegation. Additionally, the proposed method prioritises assigning voting rights to individuals closely connected to the voters who delegate."

We then focus on sub-committee voting with approvals and propose extensions of the justified representation axioms that have been considered for proportional representation in approval-based committee voting. We study the properties and relations of these axioms. For each of the axioms, we analyse whether a representative committee exists and also examine the complexity of computing and verifying such a committee."

Many people rely on flood probability maps to inform decisions about purchasing flood insurance, buying or selling real-estate, flood-proofing a house, or managing floodplain development. Current flood probability maps typically use flood zones (for example the 1 in 100 or 1 in 500-year flood zones) to communicate flooding probabilities. However, this choice of communication format can miss important details and lead to biased risk assessments. Here we develop, test, and demonstrate the FLOod Probability Interpolation Tool (FLOPIT). FLOPIT interpolates flood probabilities between water surface elevation to produce continuous flood-probability maps. We show that FLOPIT can be relatively easily applied to existing datasets used to create flood zones. Using publicly available data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood risk databases as well as state and national datasets, we produce continuous flood-probability maps at three example locations in the United States: Houston (TX), Muncy (PA), and Selinsgrove (PA). We find that the discrete flood zones generally communicate substantially lower flood probabilities than the continuous estimates."

To impose orthogonality on DNNs, both computational efficiency and stability are important. However, existing methods utilizing Riemannian optimization or hard constraints can only ensure stability while those using soft constraints can only improve efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Feedback Gradient Descent (FGD), to our knowledge, the first work showing high efficiency and stability simultaneously. FGD induces orthogonality based on the simple yet indispensable Euler discretization of a continuous-time dynamical system on the tangent bundle of the Stiefel manifold. In particular, inspired by a numerical integration method on manifolds called Feedback Integrators, we propose to instantiate it on the tangent bundle of the Stiefel manifold for the first time. In the extensive image classification experiments, FGD comprehensively outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and stability."

It requires joint reasoning over the textual and visual domains to solve the problem. Some popular referring expression datasets, however, fail to provide an ideal test bed for evaluating the reasoning ability of the models, mainly because 1) their expressions typically describe only some simple distinctive properties of the object and 2) their images contain limited distracting information. To bridge the gap, we propose a new dataset for visual reasoning in context of referring expression comprehension with two main features. First, we design a novel expression engine rendering various reasoning logics that can be flexibly combined with rich visual properties to generate expressions with varying compositionality. Second, to better exploit the full reasoning chain embodied in an expression, we propose a new test setting by adding additional distracting images containing objects sharing similar properties with the referent, thus minimising the success rate of reasoning-free cross-domain alignment. We evaluate several state-of-the-art REF models, but find none of them can achieve promising performance. A proposed modular hard mining strategy performs the best but still leaves substantial room for improvement. We hope this new dataset and task can serve as a benchmark for deeper visual reasoning analysis and foster the research on referring expression comprehension."

We introduce a gradient-based optimization framework for achieving acceleration, based on the recently introduced notion of fixed-time stability of dynamical systems. The method presents itself as a generalization of simple gradient-based methods suitably scaled to achieve convergence to the optimizer in a fixed-time, independent of the initialization. We achieve this by first leveraging a continuous-time framework for designing fixed-time stable dynamical systems, and later providing a consistent discretization strategy, such that the equivalent discrete-time algorithm tracks the optimizer in a practically fixed number of iterations. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of the proposed gradient flows, and their robustness to additive disturbances for a range of functions obeying strong convexity, strict convexity, and possibly nonconvexity but satisfying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality. We also show that the regret bound on the convergence rate is constant by virtue of the fixed-time convergence. The hyperparameters have intuitive interpretations and can be tuned to fit the requirements on the desired convergence rates. We validate the accelerated convergence properties of the proposed schemes on a range of numerical examples against the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Our work provides insights on developing novel optimization algorithms via discretization of continuous-time flows."

The motivation for the model is to calculate an optimal credit limit, which requires an expression for the expected outstanding balance. We derive its Laplace transform, assuming that purchases are made according to a marked point process and that there is a simplified balance control policy in place to prevent the credit limit being exceeded. We calculate optimal limits for a compound Poisson process example and show that the optimal limit scales with the distribution of the purchasing process and that the probability of exceeding the optimal limit remains constant. We establish a connection with the classic newsvendor model and use this to calculate bounds on the optimal limit for a more complicated balance control policy. Finally, we apply our model to real credit card purchase data."

The straightforward inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo is computationally heavy because the computational cost of inverse or Cholesky decomposition of high dimensional covariance matrices of Gaussian latent variables is cubic order of their dimension. Furthermore, since hyperparameters for Gaussian latent variables have high correlations with sampled Gaussian latent processes themselves, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo strategies are inefficient. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable computational strategy for spatial log Gaussian Cox processes. The proposed algorithm is based on pseudo-marginal Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Based on this approach, we propose estimation of approximate marginal posterior for parameters and comprehensive model validation strategies. We provide details for all of the above along with some simulation investigation for univariate and multivariate settings and analysis of a point pattern of tree data exhibiting positive and negative interaction between different species."

Among the most successful online learning methods are Decision Tree (DT) ensembles. DT ensembles provide excellent performance while adapting to changes in the data, but they are not resource efficient. Incremental tree learners keep adding new nodes to the tree but never remove old ones increasing the memory consumption over time. Gradient-based tree learning, on the other hand, requires the computation of gradients over the entire tree which is costly for even moderately sized trees. In this paper, we propose a novel memory-efficient online classification ensemble called shrub ensembles for resource-constraint systems. Our algorithm trains small to medium-sized decision trees on small windows and uses stochastic proximal gradient descent to learn the ensemble weights of these `shrubs'. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithm and include an extensive discussion on the behavior of our approach in the online setting. In a series of 2~959 experiments on 12 different datasets, we compare our method against 8 state-of-the-art methods. Our Shrub Ensembles retain an excellent performance even when only little memory is available. We show that SE offers a better accuracy-memory trade-off in 7 of 12 cases, while having a statistically significant better performance than most other methods.

216,aaai,2022,NoiseGrad - Enhancing Explanations by Introducing Stochasticity to Model Weights,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20561,"Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods shed light on the predictions of deep neural networks (DNNs). Several different approaches exist and have partly already been successfully applied in climate science. However, the often missing ground truth explanations complicate their evaluation and validation, subsequently compounding the choice of the XAI method. Therefore, in this work, we introduce XAI evaluation in the context of climate research and assess different desired explanation properties, namely, robustness, faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization. To this end we build upon previous work and train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the decade based on annual-mean temperature maps. Next, multiple local XAI methods are applied and their performance is quantified for each evaluation property and compared against a baseline test. Independent of the network type, we find that the XAI methods Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise relevance propagation, and InputGradients exhibit considerable robustness, faithfulness, and complexity while sacrificing randomization. The opposite is true for Gradient, SmoothGrad, NoiseGrad, and FusionGrad. Notably, explanations using input perturbations, such as SmoothGrad and Integrated Gradients, do not improve robustness and faithfulness, contrary to previous claims. Overall, our experiments offer a comprehensive overview of different properties of explanation methods in the climate science context and supports users in the selection of a suitable XAI method."

Our proposed method, entitled MAGIC, leverages structured gradients from a pre-trained quasi-robust classifier to better preserve the input semantics while preserving its classification accuracy, thereby guaranteeing credibility in the synthesis. Unlike current methods that use complex primitives to supervise the process or use attention maps as a weak supervisory signal, MAGIC aggregates gradients over the input, driven by a guide binary mask that enforces a strong, spatial prior. MAGIC implements a series of manipulations with a single framework achieving shape and location control, intense non-rigid shape deformations, and copy/move operations in the presence of repeating objects and gives users firm control over the synthesis by requiring to simply specify binary guide masks. Our study and findings are supported by various qualitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art on the same images sampled from ImageNet and quantitative analysis using machine perception along with a user survey of 100+ participants that endorse our synthesis quality.

In particular, temporal information can facilitate a variety of downstream applications such as case report retrieval and medical question answering. Existing methods either require expensive feature engineering or are incapable of modeling the global relational dependencies among the events. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Clinical Temporal ReLation Exaction with Probabilistic Soft Logic Regularization and Global Inference (CTRL-PG) to tackle the problem at the document level. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, I2B2-2012 and TB-Dense, demonstrate that CTRL-PG significantly outperforms baseline methods for temporal relation extraction."

Every year, the lives lost due to lung cancer exceed those lost to pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancer combined. The survival rate for lung cancer patients is very low compared to other cancer patients due to late diagnostics. Thus, early lung cancer diagnostics is crucial for patients to receive early treatments, increasing the survival rate or even becoming cancer-free. This paper proposed a deep-learning model for early lung cancer prediction and diagnosis from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. The proposed mode achieves high accuracy. In addition, it can be a beneficial tool to support radiologists' decisions in predicting and detecting lung cancer and its stage."

In contrast, little progress has been made on transfer attacks for object detectors. Object detectors take a holistic view of the image and the detection of one object (or lack thereof) often depends on other objects in the scene. This makes such detectors inherently context-aware and adversarial attacks in this space are more challenging than those targeting image classifiers. In this paper, we present a new approach to generate context-aware attacks for object detectors. We show that by using co-occurrence of objects and their relative locations and sizes as context information, we can successfully generate targeted mis-categorization attacks that achieve higher transfer success rates on blackbox object detectors than the state-of-the-art. We test our approach on a variety of object detectors with images from PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets and demonstrate up to $20$ percentage points improvement in performance compared to the other state-of-the-art methods."
222,aaai,2022,The Perils of Learning Before Optimizing,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20284,"Formulating real-world optimization problems often begins with making predictions from historical data (e.g., an optimizer that aims to recommend fast routes relies upon travel-time predictions). Typically, learning the prediction model used to generate the optimization problem and solving that problem are performed in two separate stages. Recent work has showed how such prediction models can be learned end-to-end by differentiating through the optimization task. Such methods often yield empirical improvements, which are typically attributed to end-to-end making better error tradeoffs than the standard loss function used in a two-stage solution. We refine this explanation and more precisely characterize when end-to-end can improve performance. When prediction targets are stochastic, a two-stage solution must make an a priori choice about which statistics of the target distribution to model-we consider expectations over prediction targets-while an end-to-end solution can make this choice adaptively. We show that the performance gap between a two-stage and end-to-end approach is closely related to the price of correlation concept in stochastic optimization and show the implications of some existing POC results for the predict-then-optimize problem. We then consider a novel and particularly practical setting, where multiple prediction targets are combined to obtain each of the objective function's coefficients. We give explicit constructions where (1) two-stage performs unboundedly worse than end-to-end; and (2) two-stage is optimal. We use simulations to experimentally quantify performance gaps and identify a wide range of real-world applications from the literature whose objective functions rely on multiple prediction targets, suggesting that end-to-end learning could yield significant improvements."

However, manually designing multiple prompts and verbalizers requires domain knowledge and human effort, making it difficult and expensive to scale across different datasets. In this paper, we propose two methods to automatically design multiple prompts and integrate automatic verbalizer in SSL settings without sacrificing performance. The first method uses various demonstration examples with learnable continuous prompt tokens to create diverse prompt models. The second method uses a varying number of soft prompt tokens to encourage language models to learn different prompts. For the verbalizer, we use the prototypical verbalizer to replace the manual one. In summary, we obtained the best average accuracy of 73.2% (a relative improvement of 2.52% over even the previous state-of-the-art SSL method with manual prompts and verbalizers) in different few-shot learning settings."

However, the rapid increase of the global population poses a challenge on this cornerstone by demanding more food. Modern autonomous greenhouses, equipped with sensors and actuators, provide a promising solution to the problem by empowering precise control for high-efficient food production. However, the optimal control of autonomous greenhouses is challenging, requiring decision-making based on high-dimensional sensory data, and the scaling of production is limited by the scarcity of labor capable of handling this task. With the advances of artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing technologies, we are hopeful to provide a solution to automate and smarten greenhouse control to address the above challenges. In this paper, we propose a smart agriculture solution named iGrow, for autonomous greenhouse control (AGC): (1) for the first time, we formulate the AGC problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) optimization problem; (2) we design a neural network-based simulator incorporated with the incremental mechanism to simulate the complete planting process of an autonomous greenhouse, which provides a testbed for the optimization of control strategies; (3) we propose a closed-loop bi-level optimization algorithm, which can dynamically re-optimize the greenhouse control strategy with newly observed data during real-world production. We not only conduct simulation experiments but also deploy iGrow in real scenarios, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of iGrow in autonomous greenhouse simulation and optimal control. Particularly, compelling results from the tomato pilot project in real autonomous greenhouses show that our solution significantly increases crop yield (+10.15\%) and net profit (+92.70\%) with statistical significance compared to planting experts."

However, existing deep learning-based pansharpening methods directly learn the mapping from LRMS and PAN to HRMS. These network architectures always lack sufficient interpretability, which limits further performance improvements. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel deep network for pansharpening by combining the model-based methodology with the deep learning method. Firstly, we build an observation model for pansharpening using the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) technique and design a proximal gradient algorithm to solve this model. Secondly, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a deep network, dubbed as Proximal PanNet, by learning the proximal operators using convolutional neural networks. Finally, all the learnable modules can be automatically learned in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on some benchmark datasets show that our network performs better than other advanced methods both quantitatively and qualitatively."

Most existing learning-based HDR reconstruction methods take a set of bracketed exposure sRGB images to extend the dynamic range. However, they overlook the computational and memory inefficiencies of Image Signal Processors (ISPs) when processing a set of sRGB images with different exposures. Furthermore, the absence of large-scale raw-based HDR datasets limits the research on HDR imaging. In this work, in a new aspect, we discover an excellent opportunity for HDR reconstructing directly from raw images and investigating novel neural network structures that benefit the deployment of mobile devices. Meanwhile, we construct a new HDR dataset containing raw images and process to obtain sRGB images and design a new model to reconstruct HDR utilizing the unique characteristics of long- and short-exposure images. Our key insights are threefold: (1) a new computational raw LDR-HDR pair formation pipeline is designed to construct a real-world raw HDR dataset called RealRaw-HDR; (2) a lightweight-efficient HDR model, RepUNet, is developed using the structural reparameterization technique; (3) a plug-and-play alignment-free and motion-aware short-exposure-first selection loss and a colorfulness loss are proposed to mitigate ghost artifacts and color cast. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both visual quality and quantitative metrics."
227,aaai,2022,Visual Consensus Modeling for Video-Text Retrieval,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19891,"Image-text matching plays a central role in bridging vision and language. Most existing approaches only rely on the image-text instance pair to learn their representations, thereby exploiting their matching relationships and making the corresponding alignments. Such approaches only exploit the superficial associations contained in the instance pairwise data, with no consideration of any external commonsense knowledge, which may hinder their capabilities to reason the higher-level relationships between image and text. In this paper, we propose a Consensus-aware Visual-Semantic Embedding (CVSE) model to incorporate the consensus information, namely the commonsense knowledge shared between both modalities, into image-text matching. Specifically, the consensus information is exploited by computing the statistical co-occurrence correlations between the semantic concepts from the image captioning corpus and deploying the constructed concept correlation graph to yield the consensus-aware concept (CAC) representations. Afterwards, CVSE learns the associations and alignments between image and text based on the exploited consensus as well as the instance-level representations for both modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets verify that the exploited consensus makes significant contributions to constructing more meaningful visual-semantic embeddings, with the superior performances over the state-of-the-art approaches on the bidirectional image and text retrieval task.

That is, a CNN has an inductive bias to naturally focus on objects, named as Tobias (""The object is at sight"") in this paper. This empirical inductive bias is further analyzed and successfully applied to self-supervised learning (SSL). A CNN is encouraged to learn representations that focus on the foreground object, by transforming every image into various versions with different backgrounds, where the foreground and background separation is guided by Tobias. Experimental results show that the proposed Tobias significantly improves downstream tasks, especially for object detection. This paper also shows that Tobias has consistent improvements on training sets of different sizes, and is more resilient to changes in image augmentations.

229,aaai,2022,Geometry Interaction Knowledge Graph Embeddings,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20491,"Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings have shown great power in learning representations of entities and relations for link prediction tasks. Previous work usually embeds KGs into a single geometric space such as Euclidean space (zero curved), hyperbolic space (negatively curved) or hyperspherical space (positively curved) to maintain their specific geometric structures (e.g., chain, hierarchy and ring structures). However, the topological structure of KGs appears to be complicated, since it may contain multiple types of geometric structures simultaneously. Therefore, embedding KGs in a single space, no matter the Euclidean space, hyperbolic space or hyperspheric space, cannot capture the complex structures of KGs accurately. To overcome this challenge, we propose Geometry Interaction knowledge graph Embeddings (GIE), which learns spatial structures interactively between the Euclidean, hyperbolic and hyperspherical spaces. Theoretically, our proposed GIE can capture a richer set of relational information, model key inference patterns, and enable expressive semantic matching across entities. Experimental results on three well-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks show that our GIE achieves the state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters."
230,aaai,2022,ER: Equivariance Regularizer for Knowledge Graph Completion,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20490,"Knowledge graphs are useful for many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts. To populate the graphs, knowledge graph embedding models have been developed. Knowledge graph embedding models map entities and relations in a knowledge graph to a vector space and predict unknown triples by scoring candidate triples. TransE is the first translation-based method and it is well known because of its simplicity and efficiency for knowledge graph completion. It employs the principle that the differences between entity embeddings represent their relations. The principle seems very simple, but it can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge graph. However, TransE has a problem with its regularization. TransE forces entity embeddings to be on a sphere in the embedding vector space. This regularization warps the embeddings and makes it difficult for them to fulfill the abovementioned principle. The regularization also affects adversely the accuracies of the link predictions. On the other hand, regularization is important because entity embeddings diverge by negative sampling without it. This paper proposes a novel embedding model, TorusE, to solve the regularization problem. The principle of TransE can be defined on any Lie group. A torus, which is one of the compact Lie groups, can be chosen for the embedding space to avoid regularization. To the best of our knowledge, TorusE is the first model that embeds objects on other than a real or complex vector space, and this paper is the first to formally discuss the problem of regularization of TransE. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as TransE, DistMult and ComplEx on a standard link prediction task. We show that TorusE is scalable to large-size knowledge graphs and is faster than the original TransE."
231,aaai,2022,CF-DETR: Coarse-to-Fine Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19893,"This paper takes an important step in bridging the performance gap between DETR and R-CNN for graphical object detection. Existing graphical object detection approaches have enjoyed recent enhancements in CNN-based object detection methods, achieving remarkable progress. Recently, Transformer-based detectors have considerably boosted the generic object detection performance, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features or post-processing steps such as Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) using object queries. However, the effectiveness of such enhanced transformer-based detection algorithms has yet to be verified for the problem of graphical object detection. Essentially, inspired by the latest advancements in the DETR, we employ the existing detection transformer with few modifications for graphical object detection. We modify object queries in different ways, using points, anchor boxes and adding positive and negative noise to the anchors to boost performance. These modifications allow for better handling of objects with varying sizes and aspect ratios, more robustness to small variations in object positions and sizes, and improved image discrimination between objects and non-objects. We evaluate our approach on the four graphical datasets: PubTables, TableBank, NTable and PubLaynet. Upon integrating query modifications in the DETR, we outperform prior works and achieve new state-of-the-art results with the mAP of 96.9\%, 95.7\% and 99.3\% on TableBank, PubLaynet, PubTables, respectively. The results from extensive ablations show that transformer-based methods are more effective for document analysis analogous to other applications. We hope this study draws more attention to the research of using detection transformers in document image analysis."

Unfortunately, the straight-forward rule that divides the budget proportionally is susceptible to manipulation. In a recent work, Freeman et al. [arXiv:1905.00457] proposed a class of truthful mechanisms, called moving phantom mechanisms. Among others, they propose a proportional mechanism, in the sense that in the extreme case where all agents prefer a single project to receive the whole amount, the budget is assigned proportionally. While proportionality is a naturally desired property, it is defined over a limited type of preference profiles. To address this, we expand the notion of proportionality, by proposing a quantitative framework which evaluates a budget aggregation mechanism according to its worst-case distance from the proportional allocation. Crucially, this is defined for every preference profile. We study this measure on the class of moving phantom mechanisms, and we provide approximation guarantees. For two projects, we show that the Uniform Phantom mechanism is the optimal among all truthful mechanisms. For three projects, we propose a new, proportional mechanism which is virtually optimal among all moving phantom mechanisms. Finally, we provide impossibility results regarding the approximability of moving phantom mechanisms."
233,aaai,2022,The Metric Distortion of Multiwinner Voting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20419,"We extend the recently introduced framework of metric distortion to multiwinner voting. In this framework, $n$ agents and $m$ alternatives are located in an underlying metric space. The exact distances between agents and alternatives are unknown. Instead, each agent provides a ranking of the alternatives, ordered from the closest to the farthest. Typically, the goal is to select a single alternative that approximately minimizes the total distance from the agents, and the worst-case approximation ratio is termed distortion. In the case of multiwinner voting, the goal is to select a committee of $k$ alternatives that (approximately) minimizes the total cost to all agents. We consider the scenario where the cost of an agent for a committee is her distance from the $q$-th closest alternative in the committee. We reveal a surprising trichotomy on the distortion of multiwinner voting rules in terms of $k$ and $q$: The distortion is unbounded when $q \leq k/3$, asymptotically linear in the number of agents when $k/3 < q \leq k/2$, and constant when $q > k/2$."

Particularly, the rules we study include approval voting (AV), satisfaction approval voting (SAV), net-satisfaction approval voting (NSAV), proportional approval voting (PAV), approval-based Chamberlin-Courant voting (ABCCV), minimax approval voting (MAV), etc. We show that these rules generally resist the strategic types scrutinized in the paper, with only a few exceptions. In addition, we also obtain many fixed-parameter tractability results for these problems with respect to several natural parameters, and derive polynomial-time algorithms for certain special cases."
235,aaai,2022,A Little Charity Guarantees Fair Connected Graph Partitioning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20420,"Fair division of indivisible goods is a very well-studied problem. The goal of this problem is to distribute $m$ goods to $n$ agents in a ""fair"" manner, where every agent has a valuation for each subset of goods. We assume general valuations.   Envy-freeness is the most extensively studied notion of fairness. However, envy-free allocations do not always exist when goods are indivisible. The notion of fairness we consider here is ""envy-freeness up to any good"" (EFX) where no agent envies another agent after the removal of any single good from the other agent's bundle. It is not known if such an allocation always exists even when $n=3$.   We show there is always a partition of the set of goods into $n+1$ subsets $(X_1,\ldots,X_n,P)$ where for $i \in [n]$, $X_i$ is the bundle allocated to agent $i$ and the set $P$ is unallocated (or donated to charity) such that we have$\colon$   1) envy-freeness up to any good,   2) no agent values $P$ higher than her own bundle, and   3) fewer than $n$ goods go to charity, i.e., $|P| < n$ (typically $m \gg n$).   Our proof is constructive. When agents have additive valuations and $\lvert P \rvert$ is large (i.e., when $|P|$ is close to $n$), our allocation also has a good maximin share (MMS) guarantee. Moreover, a minor variant of our algorithm also shows the existence of an allocation which is $4/7$ groupwise maximin share (GMMS): this is a notion of fairness stronger than MMS. This improves upon the current best bound of $1/2$ known for an approximate GMMS allocation."

In this setting, there is a stream of items and the goal is to compute the desired quantities (usually data statistics) while making a single pass through the stream and using as little space as possible.   Motivated by the importance of data privacy, we develop differentially private streaming algorithms under the continual release setting, where the union of outputs of the algorithm at every timestamp must be differentially private. Specifically, we study the fundamental $\ell_p$ $(p\in [0,+\infty))$ frequency moment estimation problem under this setting, and give an $\varepsilon$-DP algorithm that achieves $(1+\eta)$-relative approximation $(\forall \eta\in(0,1))$ with $\mathrm{poly}\log(Tn)$ additive error and uses $\mathrm{poly}\log(Tn)\cdot \max(1, n^{1-2/p})$ space, where $T$ is the length of the stream and $n$ is the size of the universe of elements. Our space is near optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors even in the non-private setting.   To obtain our results, we first reduce several primitives under the differentially private continual release model, such as counting distinct elements, heavy hitters and counting low frequency elements, to the simpler, counting/summing problems in the same setting. Based on these primitives, we develop a differentially private continual release level set estimation approach to address the $\ell_p$ frequency moment estimation problem.   We also provide a simple extension of our results to the harder sliding window model, where the statistics must be maintained over the past $W$ data items."

Usefulness and Safety with Human Prompters in the Wild,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20466,"A challenge in the Dialogue State Tracking (DST) field is adapting models to new domains without using any supervised data, zero-shot domain adaptation. Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) has the potential to address this problem due to its robustness. However, it has yet to be applied to the zero-shot scenarios, as it is not clear how to apply it unsupervisedly.   Our method, Prompter, uses descriptions of target domain slots to generate dynamic prefixes that are concatenated to the key and values at each layer's self-attention mechanism. This allows for the use of prefix-tuning in zero-shot. Prompter outperforms previous methods on both the MultiWOZ and SGD benchmarks. In generating prefixes, our analyses find that Prompter not only utilizes the semantics of slot descriptions but also how often the slots appear together in conversation. Moreover, Prompter's gains are due to its improved ability to distinguish ""none""-valued dialogue slots, compared against baselines."

The price-displaying feature not only influences the consumers' decisions, but also affects the advertisers' bidding behaviors. In this paper, we study ad auctions with display prices from the perspective of mechanism design, in which advertisers are asked to submit both the costs and prices of their products. We provide a characterization for all incentive compatible auctions with display prices, and use it to design auctions under two scenarios. In the former scenario, the display prices are assumed to be exogenously determined. For this setting, we derive the welfare-maximizing and revenue-maximizing auctions for any realization of the price profile. In the latter, advertisers are allowed to strategize display prices in their own interests. We investigate two families of allocation policies within the scenario and identify the equilibrium prices accordingly. Our results reveal that the display prices do affect the design of ad auctions and the platform can leverage such information to optimize the performance of ad delivery."

We introduce a model of novice bidders who do not know know the joint distribution of signals and instead build a statistical model relating others' bids to their own ex post value from the data sets accessible from past similar auctions. Crucially, we assume that only ex post values and bids are accessible while signals observed by bidders in past auctions remain private. We consider steady-states in such environments, and importantly we allow for correlation in the signal distribution. We first observe that data-driven bidders may behave suboptimally in classical auctions such as the second-price or first-price auctions whenever there are correlations. Allowing for a mix of rational (or experienced) and data-driven (novice) bidders results in inefficiencies in such auctions, and we show the inefficiency extends to all auction-like mechanisms in which bidders are restricted to submit one-dimensional (real-valued) bids."

In this work, we consider a general model to address such problems, where each action returns a random reward, cost, and penalty from an unknown joint distribution, and the decision-maker aims to maximize the total reward under a budget constraint $B$ on the total cost and a stochastic constraint on the time-average penalty. We propose a novel low-complexity algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization methodology, named ${\tt LyOn}$, and prove that for $K$ arms it achieves $O(\sqrt{K B\log B})$ regret and zero constraint-violation when $B$ is sufficiently large. The low computational cost and sharp performance bounds of ${\tt LyOn}$ suggest that Lyapunov-based algorithm design methodology can be effective in solving constrained bandit optimization problems."

Such a problem is known as the temporal dynamics problem, and it is one of the main challenges in recommender system modeling. Different from the popular recurrent modeling approach, we propose a new solution named LeapRec to the temporal dynamic problem by using trajectory-based meta-learning to model time dependencies. LeapRec characterizes temporal dynamics by two complement components named global time leap (GTL) and ordered time leap (OTL). By design, GTL learns long-term patterns by finding the shortest learning path across unordered temporal data. Cooperatively, OTL learns short-term patterns by considering the sequential nature of the temporal data.

242,aaai,2022,Active Sampling for Text Classification with Subinstance Level Queries,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20563,"Distribution estimation has been demonstrated as one of the most effective approaches in dealing with few-shot image classification, as the low-level patterns and underlying representations can be easily transferred across different tasks in computer vision domain. However, directly applying this approach to few-shot text classification is challenging, since leveraging the statistics of known classes with sufficient samples to calibrate the distributions of novel classes may cause negative effects due to serious category difference in text domain. To alleviate this issue, we propose two simple yet effective strategies to estimate the distributions of the novel classes by utilizing unlabeled query samples, thus avoiding the potential negative transfer issue. Specifically, we first assume a class or sample follows the Gaussian distribution, and use the original support set and the nearest few query samples to estimate the corresponding mean and covariance. Then, we augment the labeled samples by sampling from the estimated distribution, which can provide sufficient supervision for training the classification model. Extensive experiments on eight few-shot text classification datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly."

First, we propose a parameterized family of relaxations for weighted envy-freeness and the same for weighted proportionality; the parameters indicate whether smaller-weight or larger-weight agents should be given a higher priority. We show that each notion in these families can always be satisfied, but any two cannot necessarily be fulfilled simultaneously. We then introduce an intuitive weighted generalization of maximin share fairness and establish the optimal approximation of it that can be guaranteed. Furthermore, we characterize the implication relations between the various weighted fairness notions introduced in this and prior work, and relate them to the lower and upper quota axioms from apportionment."

This and other related results are obtained by symmetrizing techniques described by L. Asimov and B. Roth in their paper `The Rigidity Of Graphs' from 1978 and by using the fact that the rigidity matrix of a symmetric framework can be transformed into a block-diagonalized form by means of group representation theory. The finite flexes that can be detected with these symmetry-based methods can in general not be found with the analogous non-symmetric methods."
245,aaai,2022,Texture Generation Using Dual-Domain Feature Flow with Multi-View Hallucinations,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19895,"We propose a dual-domain generative model to estimate a texture map from a single image for colorizing a 3D human model. When estimating a texture map, a single image is insufficient as it reveals only one facet of a 3D object. To provide sufficient information for estimating a complete texture map, the proposed model simultaneously generates multi-view hallucinations in the image domain and an estimated texture map in the texture domain. During the generating process, each domain generator exchanges features to the other by a flow-based local attention mechanism. In this manner, the proposed model can estimate a texture map utilizing abundant multi-view image features from which multiview hallucinations are generated. As a result, the estimated texture map contains consistent colors and patterns over the entire region. Experiments show the superiority of our model for estimating a directly render-able texture map, which is applicable to 3D animation rendering. Furthermore, our model also improves an overall generation quality in the image domain for pose and viewpoint transfer tasks."

We prove generalised concentration bounds for these continuous and dominant risk functionals and show that a wide class of popular risk functionals belong to this class. Using our newly developed analytical toolkits, we analyse the algorithm $\rho$-MTS (for multinomial distributions) and prove that they admit asymptotically optimal regret bounds of risk-averse algorithms under CVaR, proportional hazard, and other ubiquitous risk measures. More generally, we prove the asymptotic optimality of $\rho$-MTS for Bernoulli distributions for a class of risk measures known as empirical distribution performance measures (EDPMs); this includes the well-known mean-variance. Numerical simulations show that the regret bounds incurred by our algorithms are reasonably tight vis-\`a-vis algorithm-independent lower bounds."

However, watermarks produced by most existing model watermarking methods can be easily evaded by ensemble distillation, because averaging the outputs of multiple ensembled models can significantly reduce or even erase the watermarks. In this paper, we focus on tackling the challenging task of defending against ensemble distillation. We propose a novel watermarking technique named CosWM to achieve outstanding model watermarking performance against ensemble distillation. CosWM is not only elegant in design, but also comes with desirable theoretical guarantees. Our extensive experiments on public data sets demonstrate the excellent performance of CosWM and its advantages over the state-of-the-art baselines."

In both models, our algorithms achieve significantly improved error guarantees than the previous state-of-the-art. In addition, in the local model, our algorithm significantly reduces the number of interaction rounds.   Although the problem has been widely studied in the context of differential privacy, all of the existing constructions achieve only super constant approximation factors. We present, for the first time, efficient private algorithms for the problem with constant multiplicative error. Furthermore, we show how to modify our algorithms so they compute private corsets for k-means clustering in both models."

The goal is to select a sequence of actions to minimize the regret without violating the safety constraints at any time step (with high probability). The parameters that specify the linear safety constraints are unknown to the algorithm. The algorithm has access to only the noisy observations of constraints for the chosen actions. We propose an algorithm, called the {Safe Online Projected Gradient Descent} (SO-PGD) algorithm, to address this problem. We show that, under the assumption of the availability of a safe baseline action, the SO-PGD algorithm achieves a regret $O(T^{2/3})$. While there are many algorithms for online convex optimization (OCO) problems with safety constraints available in the literature, they allow constraint violations during learning/optimization, and the focus has been on characterizing the cumulative constraint violations. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that provides an algorithm with provable guarantees on the regret, without violating the linear safety constraints (with high probability) at any time step."

However, it suffers from high computational costs due to the iterative adversarial attacks in each training step. Recent studies show that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a single-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still lags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability and model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast Adversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized smoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following this new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward smoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over single-step robust training methods. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves similar model robustness as the original TRADES method while using much less training time ($\sim$3x improvement with the same training schedule)."

However, very low-quality inputs cannot offer accurate geometric prior while high-quality references are inaccessible, limiting the applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose GFP-GAN that leverages rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pretrained face GAN for blind face restoration. This Generative Facial Prior (GFP) is incorporated into the face restoration process via novel channel-split spatial feature transform layers, which allow our method to achieve a good balance of realness and fidelity. Thanks to the powerful generative facial prior and delicate designs, our GFP-GAN could jointly restore facial details and enhance colors with just a single forward pass, while GAN inversion methods require expensive image-specific optimization at inference. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance to prior art on both synthetic and real-world datasets."

However, it is difficult to collect large-scale multi-label annotations due to the complexity of both the input images and output label spaces. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose a structured semantic transfer (SST) framework that enables training multi-label recognition models with partial labels, i.e., merely some labels are known while other labels are missing (also called unknown labels) per image. The framework consists of two complementary transfer modules that explore within-image and cross-image semantic correlations to transfer knowledge of known labels to generate pseudo labels for unknown labels. Specifically, an intra-image semantic transfer module learns image-specific label co-occurrence matrix and maps the known labels to complement unknown labels based on this matrix. Meanwhile, a cross-image transfer module learns category-specific feature similarities and helps complement unknown labels with high similarities. Finally, both known and generated labels are used to train the multi-label recognition models. Extensive experiments on the Microsoft COCO, Visual Genome and Pascal VOC datasets show that the proposed SST framework obtains superior performance over current state-of-the-art algorithms.

Recently, the Hamiltonian neural network, which approximates the Hamiltonian as a neural network, and its extensions have attracted much attention. This is a very powerful method, but its use in theoretical studies remains limited. In this study, by combining the statistical learning theory and Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory, we provide a theoretical analysis of the behavior of Hamiltonian neural networks when the learning error is not completely zero. A Hamiltonian neural network with non-zero errors can be considered as a perturbation from the true dynamics, and the perturbation theory of the Hamilton equation is widely known as the KAM theory. To apply the KAM theory, we provide a generalization error bound for Hamiltonian neural networks by deriving an estimate of the covering number of the gradient of the multi-layer perceptron, which is the key ingredient of the model. This error bound gives an $L^\infty$ bound on the Hamiltonian that is required in the application of the KAM theory."

However, DL models have been known to perform poorly on inconspicuous adversarial perturbations. Although many works have studied these adversarial perturbations in general, the adversarial vulnerabilities of deep crowd-flow prediction models in particular have remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform a rigorous analysis of the adversarial vulnerabilities of DL-based crowd-flow prediction models under multiple threat settings, making three-fold contributions. (1) We propose CaV-detect by formally identifying two novel properties - Consistency and Validity - of the crowd-flow prediction inputs that enable the detection of standard adversarial inputs with 0% false acceptance rate (FAR). (2) We leverage universal adversarial perturbations and an adaptive adversarial loss to present adaptive adversarial attacks to evade CaV-detect defense. (3) We propose CVPR, a Consistent, Valid and Physically-Realizable adversarial attack, that explicitly inducts the consistency and validity priors in the perturbation generation mechanism. We find out that although the crowd-flow models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, it is extremely challenging to simulate these perturbations in physical settings, notably when CaV-detect is in place. We also show that CVPR attack considerably outperforms the adaptively modified standard attacks in FAR and adversarial loss metrics. We conclude with useful insights emerging from our work and highlight promising future research directions."

This method constructs a smoothed DNN model and certifies its robustness through statistical sampling, but it is computationally expensive, especially when certifying with a large number of samples. Furthermore, when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive.   We present the first approach for incremental robustness certification for randomized smoothing, IRS. We show how to reuse the certification guarantees for the original smoothed model to certify an approximated model with very few samples. IRS significantly reduces the computational cost of certifying modified DNNs while maintaining strong robustness guarantees. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing up to 3x certification speedup over the certification that applies randomized smoothing of the approximate model from scratch."

As the 3D pose transfer essentially is a deformation procedure dependent on the given meshes, the intuition of this work is to perceive the geometric inconsistency between the given meshes with the powerful self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we propose a novel geometry-contrastive Transformer that has an efficient 3D structured perceiving ability to the global geometric inconsistencies across the given meshes. Moreover, locally, a simple yet efficient central geodesic contrastive loss is further proposed to improve the regional geometric-inconsistency learning. At last, we present a latent isometric regularization module together with a novel semi-synthesized dataset for the cross-dataset 3D pose transfer task towards unknown spaces. The massive experimental results prove the efficacy of our approach by showing state-of-the-art quantitative performances on SMPL-NPT, FAUST and our new proposed dataset SMG-3D datasets, as well as promising qualitative results on MG-cloth and SMAL datasets.

Estimating the causal effect of a marketing treatment, an uplift model facilitates targeting communication to responsive customers and efficient allocation of marketing budgets. Research into uplift models focuses on conversion models to maximize incremental sales. The paper introduces uplift modeling strategies for maximizing incremental revenues. If customers differ in their spending behavior, revenue maximization is a more plausible business objective compared to maximizing conversions. The proposed methodology entails a transformation of the prediction target, customer-level revenues, that facilitates implementing a causal uplift model using standard machine learning algorithms. The distribution of campaign revenues is typically zero-inflated because of many non-buyers. Remedies to this modeling challenge are incorporated in the proposed revenue uplift strategies in the form of two-stage models. Empirical experiments using real-world e-commerce data confirm the merits of the proposed revenue uplift strategy over relevant alternatives including uplift models for conver-sion and recently developed causal machine learning algorithms. To quantify the degree to which improved targeting decisions raise return on marketing, the paper develops a decomposition of campaign profit. Applying the decomposition to a digital coupon targeting campaign, the paper provides evidence that revenue uplift modeling, as well as causal machine learning, can improve cam-paign profit substantially."

However, its quality is suffered from lack of ample sources of expert information. This paper employs AMiner as the basis with an aim at linking any external experts to the counterparts on AMiner. As it is infeasible to acquire sufficient linkages from arbitrary external sources, we explore the problem of zero-shot expert linking. In this paper, we propose CODE, which first pre-trains an expert linking model by contrastive learning on AMiner such that it can capture the representation and matching patterns of experts without supervised signals, then it is fine-tuned between AMiner and external sources to enhance the models transferability in an adversarial manner. For evaluation, we first design two intrinsic tasks, author identification and paper clustering, to validate the representation and matching capability endowed by contrastive learning. Then the final external expert linking performance on two genres of external sources also implies the superiority of the adversarial fine-tuning method. Additionally, we show the online deployment of CODE, and continuously improve its online performance via active learning."

Recent work has used generative models (GANs in particular) for providing high-fidelity simulation of real-world systems. However, such generative models are often monolithic and miss out on modeling the interaction in multi-agent systems. In this work, we take a first step towards building multiple interacting generative models (GANs) that reflects the interaction in real world. We build and analyze a hierarchical set-up where a higher-level GAN is conditioned on the output of multiple lower-level GANs. We present a technique of using feedback from the higher-level GAN to improve performance of lower-level GANs. We mathematically characterize the conditions under which our technique is impactful, including understanding the transfer learning nature of our set-up. We present three distinct experiments on synthetic data, time series data, and image domain, revealing the wide applicability of our technique."

Most existing neural models make predictions without giving clues about which part of a false claim goes wrong. In this paper, we propose LOREN, an approach for interpretable fact verification. We decompose the verification of the whole claim at phrase-level, where the veracity of the phrases serves as explanations and can be aggregated into the final verdict according to logical rules. The key insight of LOREN is to represent claim phrase veracity as three-valued latent variables, which are regularized by aggregation logical rules. The final claim verification is based on all latent variables. Thus, LOREN enjoys the additional benefit of interpretability -- it is easy to explain how it reaches certain results with claim phrase veracity. Experiments on a public fact verification benchmark show that LOREN is competitive against previous approaches while enjoying the merit of faithful and accurate interpretability. The resources of LOREN are available at: https://github.com/jiangjiechen/LOREN."

However, most existing methods have limited defogging capabilities for real cases because they are trained on the paired clear and synthesized foggy images of the same scenes. In addition, they have limitations in preserving vivid color and rich textual details in defogging. To address these issues, we develop a novel generative adversarial network, called quad-path cycle consistent adversarial network (QPC-Net), for single image defogging. QPC-Net consists of a Fog2Fogfree block and a Fogfree2Fog block. In each block, there are three learning-based modules, namely, fog removal, color-texture recovery, and fog synthetic, which sequentially compose dual-path that constrain each other to generate high quality images. Specifically, the color-texture recovery model is designed to exploit the self-similarity of texture and structure information by learning the holistic channel-spatial feature correlations between the foggy image with its several derived images. Moreover, in the fog synthetic module, we utilize the atmospheric scattering model to guide it to improve the generative quality by focusing on an atmospheric light optimization with a novel sky segmentation network. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that QPC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art defogging methods in terms of quantitative accuracy and subjective visual quality."

(2) Small objects are easily blocked which breaks the shape of their meshes in 3D point cloud. In this paper, we propose a pillar set abstraction (PSA) and foreground point compensation (FPC) and design a point-based detection network, PSA-Det3D, to improve the detection performance for small object. The PSA embeds a pillar query operation on the basis of set abstraction (SA) to expand its receptive field of the network, which can aggregate point-wise features effectively. To locate more occluded objects, we persent a proposal generation layer consisting of a foreground point segmentation and a FPC module.

Most existing TTA methods adapt the trained classifier using the classifier's prediction on the test data as pseudo-label. However, under test-time domain shift, accuracy of the pseudo labels cannot be guaranteed, and thus the TTA methods often encounter performance degradation at the adapted classifier. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel test-time adaptation method, called Test-time Adaptation via Self-Training with nearest neighbor information (TAST), which is composed of the following procedures: (1) adds trainable adaptation modules on top of the trained feature extractor; (2) newly defines a pseudo-label distribution for the test data by using the nearest neighbor information; (3) trains these modules only a few times during test time to match the nearest neighbor-based pseudo label distribution and a prototype-based class distribution for the test data; and (4) predicts the label of test data using the average predicted class distribution from these modules. The pseudo-label generation is based on the basic intuition that a test data and its nearest neighbor in the embedding space are likely to share the same label under the domain shift. By utilizing multiple randomly initialized adaptation modules, TAST extracts useful information for the classification of the test data under the domain shift, using the nearest neighbor information. TAST showed better performance than the state-of-the-art TTA methods on two standard benchmark tasks, domain generalization, namely VLCS, PACS, OfficeHome, and TerraIncognita, and image corruption, particularly CIFAR-10/100C."

Existing methods are mostly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), whose building blocks either process local neighbor pixels at a time, or, when 3D convolutions are used to model temporal information, suffer from the misalignment problem caused by person movement. In this paper, we propose to overcome the limitations of normal convolutions with a human-oriented graph method. Specifically, features located at person joint keypoints are extracted and connected as a spatial-temporal graph. These keypoint features are then updated by message passing from their connected nodes with a graph convolutional network (GCN). During training, the GCN can be attached to any CNN-based person re-ID model to assist representation learning on feature maps, whilst it can be dropped after training for better inference speed. Our method brings significant improvements over the CNN-based baseline model on the MARS dataset with generated person keypoints and a newly annotated dataset: PoseTrackReID. It also defines a new state-of-the-art method in terms of top-1 accuracy and mean average precision in comparison to prior works."

Recent work on probing pre-trained language models uncovered a wide range of linguistic properties encoded in their contextualized representations. However, it is unclear whether they encode semantic knowledge that is crucial to symbolic inference methods. We propose a methodology for probing linguistic information for logical inference in pre-trained language model representations. Our probing datasets cover a list of linguistic phenomena required by major symbolic inference systems. We find that (i) pre-trained language models do encode several types of linguistic information for inference, but there are also some types of information that are weakly encoded, (ii) language models can effectively learn missing linguistic information through fine-tuning. Overall, our findings provide insights into which aspects of linguistic information for logical inference do language models and their pre-training procedures capture. Moreover, we have demonstrated language models' potential as semantic and background knowledge bases for supporting symbolic inference methods."

In this paper, we propose EDUCAT, an editing-based unsupervised approach for counterfactual story rewriting. EDUCAT includes a target position detection strategy based on estimating causal effects of the what-if conditions, which keeps the causal invariant parts of the story. EDUCAT then generates the stories under fluency, coherence and minimal-edits constraints. We also propose a new metric to alleviate the shortcomings of current automatic metrics and better evaluate the trade-off. We evaluate EDUCAT on a public counterfactual story rewriting benchmark. Experiments show that EDUCAT achieves the best trade-off over unsupervised SOTA methods according to both automatic and human evaluation.

In real applications, often simplicial complexes are weighted. Here we propose a non-equilibrium model for weighted growing simplicial complexes. The proposed dynamics is able to generate weighted simplicial complexes with a rich interplay between weights and topology emerging not just at the level of nodes and links, but also at the level of faces of higher dimension."
273,aaai,2022,Fuzzy Logic Based Logical Query Answering on Knowledge Graphs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20310,"Answering complex First-Order Logical (FOL) queries on large-scale incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) is an important yet challenging task. Recent advances embed logical queries and KG entities in the same space and conduct query answering via dense similarity search. However, most logical operators designed in previous studies do not satisfy the axiomatic system of classical logic, limiting their performance. Moreover, these logical operators are parameterized and thus require many complex FOL queries as training data, which are often arduous to collect or even inaccessible in most real-world KGs. We thus present FuzzQE, a fuzzy logic based logical query embedding framework for answering FOL queries over KGs. FuzzQE follows fuzzy logic to define logical operators in a principled and learning-free manner, where only entity and relation embeddings require learning. FuzzQE can further benefit from labeled complex logical queries for training. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FuzzQE provides significantly better performance in answering FOL queries compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, FuzzQE trained with only KG link prediction can achieve comparable performance to those trained with extra complex query data."
274,aaai,2022,Guide Local Feature Matching by Overlap Estimation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19913,"Local image feature matching under large appearance, viewpoint, and distance changes is challenging yet important. Conventional methods detect and match tentative local features across the whole images, with heuristic consistency checks to guarantee reliable matches. In this paper, we introduce a novel Overlap Estimation method conditioned on image pairs with TRansformer, named OETR, to constrain local feature matching in the commonly visible region. OETR performs overlap estimation in a two-step process of feature correlation and then overlap regression. As a preprocessing module, OETR can be plugged into any existing local feature detection and matching pipeline, to mitigate potential view angle or scale variance. Intensive experiments show that OETR can boost state-of-the-art local feature matching performance substantially, especially for image pairs with small shared regions. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/AbyssGaze/OETR."

This article is the first substantive effort to theoretically quantify the behavior of the posterior in this recent line of research. In particular, assuming a known supersmooth error density, a Dirichlet process mixture of Normals on the true density leads to a posterior convergence rate same as the minimax rate $(\log n)^{-\eta/\beta}$ adaptively over the smoothness $\eta$ of an appropriate H\""{o}lder space of densities, where $\beta$ is the degree of smoothness of the error distribution. Our main contribution is achieving adaptive minimax rates with respect to the $L_p$ norm for $2 \leq p \leq \infty$ under mild regularity conditions on the true density. En route, we develop tight concentration bounds for a class of kernel based deconvolution estimators which might be of independent interest."

In this work, we move toward the answer with one more step by connecting zero stability and model performance. Specifically, we found that if a discrete solver of an ordinary differential equation is zero stable, the CNN corresponding to that solver performs well. We first give the interpretation of zero stability in the context of deep learning and then investigate the performance of existing first- and second-order CNNs under different zero-stable circumstances. Based on the preliminary observation, we provide a higher-order discretization to construct CNNs and then propose a zero-stable network (ZeroSNet). To guarantee zero stability of the ZeroSNet, we first deduce a structure that meets consistency conditions and then give a zero stable region of a training-free parameter. By analyzing the roots of a characteristic equation, we theoretically obtain the optimal coefficients of feature maps. Empirically, we present our results from three aspects: We provide extensive empirical evidence of different depth on different datasets to show that the moduli of the characteristic equation's roots are the keys for the performance of CNNs that require historical features; Our experiments show that ZeroSNet outperforms existing CNNs which is based on high-order discretization; ZeroSNets show better robustness against noises on the input.

277,aaai,2022,Adversarial Training for Improving Model Robustness? Look at Both Prediction and Interpretation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21289,"Neural language models show vulnerability to adversarial examples which are semantically similar to their original counterparts with a few words replaced by their synonyms. A common way to improve model robustness is adversarial training which follows two steps-collecting adversarial examples by attacking a target model, and fine-tuning the model on the augmented dataset with these adversarial examples. The objective of traditional adversarial training is to make a model produce the same correct predictions on an original/adversarial example pair. However, the consistency between model decision-makings on two similar texts is ignored. We argue that a robust model should behave consistently on original/adversarial example pairs, that is making the same predictions (what) based on the same reasons (how) which can be reflected by consistent interpretations. In this work, we propose a novel feature-level adversarial training method named FLAT. FLAT aims at improving model robustness in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and play as a bottleneck teaching the model to make predictions based on important words. FLAT explicitly shoots at the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms in original/adversarial example pairs by regularizing the corresponding global word importance scores. Experiments show the effectiveness of FLAT in improving the robustness with respect to both predictions and interpretations of four neural network models (LSTM, CNN, BERT, and DeBERTa) to two adversarial attacks on four text classification tasks. The models trained via FLAT also show better robustness than baseline models on unforeseen adversarial examples across different attacks."

However, these models do not take into account the sparseness and incompleteness of knowledge graph (KG)and current dialogue models cannot be applied to dynamic KG. This paper proposes a dynamic Knowledge graph-based dialogue generation method with improved adversarial Meta-Learning (KDAD). KDAD formulates dynamic knowledge triples as a problem of adversarial attack and incorporates the objective of quickly adapting to dynamic knowledge-aware dialogue generation. We train a knowledge graph-based dialog model with improved ADML using minimal training samples. The model can initialize the parameters and adapt to previous unseen knowledge so that training can be quickly completed based on only a few knowledge triples. We show that our model significantly outperforms other baselines. We evaluate and demonstrate that our method adapts extremely fast and well to dynamic knowledge graph-based dialogue generation."

Phenotypes associated with engineered and natural genetic variation are widely recorded using phenotype ontologies in model organisms, as are signs and symptoms of human Mendelian diseases in databases such as OMIM and Orphanet. Exploiting these resources, several computational methods have been developed for integration and analysis of phenotype data to identify the genetic etiology of diseases or suggest plausible interventions. A similar resource would be highly useful not only for rare and Mendelian diseases, but also for common, complex and infectious diseases. We apply a semantic text- mining approach to identify the phenotypes (signs and symptoms) associated with over 8,000 diseases. We demonstrate that our method generates phenotypes that correctly identify known disease-associated genes in mice and humans with high accuracy. Using a phenotypic similarity measure, we generate a human disease network in which diseases that share signs and symptoms cluster together, and we use this network to identify phenotypic disease modules."
280,aaai,2022,Diaformer: Automatic Diagnosis via Symptoms Sequence Generation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20365,"Automatic diagnosis has attracted increasing attention but remains challenging due to multi-step reasoning. Recent works usually address it by reinforcement learning methods. However, these methods show low efficiency and require taskspecific reward functions. Considering the conversation between doctor and patient allows doctors to probe for symptoms and make diagnoses, the diagnosis process can be naturally seen as the generation of a sequence including symptoms and diagnoses. Inspired by this, we reformulate automatic diagnosis as a symptoms Sequence Generation (SG) task and propose a simple but effective automatic Diagnosis model based on Transformer (Diaformer). We firstly design the symptom attention framework to learn the generation of symptom inquiry and the disease diagnosis. To alleviate the discrepancy between sequential generation and disorder of implicit symptoms, we further design three orderless training mechanisms. Experiments on three public datasets show that our model outperforms baselines on disease diagnosis by 1%, 6% and 11.5% with the highest training efficiency. Detailed analysis on symptom inquiry prediction demonstrates that the potential of applying symptoms sequence generation for automatic diagnosis."

In practice, little may be known about the category overlap between the two domains. While some methods address target settings with either partial or open-set categories, they assume that the particular setting is known a priori. We propose a more universally applicable domain adaptation framework that can handle arbitrary category shift, called Domain Adaptative Neighborhood Clustering via Entropy optimization (DANCE). DANCE combines two novel ideas: First, as we cannot fully rely on source categories to learn features discriminative for the target, we propose a novel neighborhood clustering technique to learn the structure of the target domain in a self-supervised way. Second, we use entropy-based feature alignment and rejection to align target features with the source, or reject them as unknown categories based on their entropy. We show through extensive experiments that DANCE outperforms baselines across open-set, open-partial and partial domain adaptation settings. Implementation is available at https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/DANCE."

Although many commonly-used neural components (e.g., convolution) and extensible neural networks (e.g., ResNet) have been developed by the machine learning community, few of them were effective for tabular data and few designs were adequately tailored for tabular data structures. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible neural component for tabular data, called Abstract Layer (AbstLay), which learns to explicitly group correlative input features and generate higher-level features for semantics abstraction. Also, we design a structure re-parameterization method to compress the learned AbstLay, thus reducing the computational complexity by a clear margin in the reference phase. A special basic block is built using AbstLays, and we construct a family of Deep Abstract Networks (DANets) for tabular data classification and regression by stacking such blocks. In DANets, a special shortcut path is introduced to fetch information from raw tabular features, assisting feature interactions across different levels. Comprehensive experiments on seven real-world tabular datasets show that our AbstLay and DANets are effective for tabular data classification and regression, and the computational complexity is superior to competitive methods. Besides, we evaluate the performance gains of DANet as it goes deep, verifying the extendibility of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/WhatAShot/DANet."

Recently, weakly supervised methods still have a large performance gap compared to fully supervised ones, while the latter requires laborious timestamp annotations. In this study, we aim to reduce the annotation cost yet keep competitive performance for TSG task compared to fully supervised ones. To achieve this goal, we investigate a recently proposed glance-supervised temporal sentence grounding task, which requires only single frame annotation (referred to as glance annotation) for each query. Under this setup, we propose a Dynamic Gaussian prior based Grounding framework with Glance annotation (D3G), which consists of a Semantic Alignment Group Contrastive Learning module (SA-GCL) and a Dynamic Gaussian prior Adjustment module (DGA). Specifically, SA-GCL samples reliable positive moments from a 2D temporal map via jointly leveraging Gaussian prior and semantic consistency, which contributes to aligning the positive sentence-moment pairs in the joint embedding space. Moreover, to alleviate the annotation bias resulting from glance annotation and model complex queries consisting of multiple events, we propose the DGA module, which adjusts the distribution dynamically to approximate the ground truth of target moments. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed D3G. It outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods by a large margin and narrows the performance gap compared to fully supervised methods.

Recognizing and discovering terrain characteristics is challenging because similar terrains may have very different appearances (e.g., carpet comes in many colors), while terrains with very similar appearance may have very different physical properties (e.g. mulch versus dirt). In order to address the inherent ambiguity in vision-based terrain recognition and discovery, we propose a multi-modal self-supervised learning technique that switches between audio features extracted from a mic attached to the underside of a mobile platform and image features extracted by a camera on the platform to cluster terrain types. The terrain cluster labels are then used to train an image-based convolutional neural network to predict changes in terrain types. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised terrain type discovery method achieves over 80% accuracy, which greatly outperforms several baselines and suggests strong potential for assistive applications."

The classification of answerability questions is a relatively significant sub-task in machine reading comprehension; however, there haven't been many studies. Retro-Reader is one of the studies that has solved this problem effectively. However, the encoders of most traditional machine reading comprehension models in general and Retro-Reader, in particular, have not been able to exploit the contextual semantic information of the context completely. Inspired by SemBERT, we use semantic role labels from the SRL task to add semantics to pre-trained language models such as mBERT, XLM-R, PhoBERT. This experiment was conducted to compare the influence of semantics on the classification of answerability for the Vietnamese machine reading comprehension. Additionally, we hope this experiment will enhance the encoder for the Retro-Reader model's Sketchy Reading Module. The improved Retro-Reader model's encoder with semantics was first applied to the Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension task and obtained positive results."

Current state-of-the-art OCC models learn a compact normality description by hyper-sphere minimisation, but they often suffer from overfitting the training data, especially when the training set is small or contaminated with anomalous samples. To address this issue, we introduce the interpolated Gaussian descriptor (IGD) method, a novel OCC model that learns a one-class Gaussian anomaly classifier trained with adversarially interpolated training samples. The Gaussian anomaly classifier differentiates the training samples based on their distance to the Gaussian centre and the standard deviation of these distances, offering the model a discriminability w.r.t. the given samples during training. The adversarial interpolation is enforced to consistently learn a smooth Gaussian descriptor, even when the training data is small or contaminated with anomalous samples. This enables our model to learn the data description based on the representative normal samples rather than fringe or anomalous samples, resulting in significantly improved normality description. In extensive experiments on diverse popular benchmarks, including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, MVTec AD and two medical datasets, IGD achieves better detection accuracy than current state-of-the-art models. IGD also shows better robustness in problems with small or contaminated training sets. Code is available at https://github.com/tianyu0207/IGD."

However, the output event stream of existing DVS inevitably contains background activity noise (BA noise) due to dark current and junction leakage current, which will affect the temporal correlation of objects, resulting in deteriorated motion estimation performance. Particularly, the existing filter-based denoising methods cannot be directly applied to suppress the noise in event stream, since there is no spatial correlation. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel progressive framework, in which a Motion Estimation (ME) module and an Event Denoising (ED) module are jointly optimized in a mutually reinforced manner. Specifically, based on the maximum sharpness criterion, ME module divides the input event into several segments by adaptive clustering in a motion compensating warp field, and captures the temporal correlation of event stream according to the clustered motion parameters. Taking temporal correlation as guidance, ED module calculates the confidence that each event belongs to real activity events, and transmits it to ME module to update energy function of motion segmentation for noise suppression. The two steps are iteratively updated until stable motion segmentation results are obtained. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approaches against the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods."
288,aaai,2022,Attacking Video Recognition Models with Bullet-Screen Comments,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19907,"Recent research has demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial patches which introduce perceptible but localized changes to the input. Nevertheless, existing approaches have focused on generating adversarial patches on images, their counterparts in videos have been less explored. Compared with images, attacking videos is much more challenging as it needs to consider not only spatial cues but also temporal cues. To close this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial attack in this paper, the bullet-screen comment (BSC) attack, which attacks video recognition models with BSCs. Specifically, adversarial BSCs are generated with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where the environment is set as the target model and the agent plays the role of selecting the position and transparency of each BSC. By continuously querying the target models and receiving feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its selection strategies in order to achieve a high fooling rate with non-overlapping BSCs. As BSCs can be regarded as a kind of meaningful patch, adding it to a clean video will not affect people' s understanding of the video content, nor will arouse people' s suspicion. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. On both UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, our BSC attack method can achieve about 90\% fooling rate when attacking three mainstream video recognition models, while only occluding \textless 8\% areas in the video.

The only considerable and non-trivial improvement of this approximation ratio was obtained by Gotthilf and Lewenstein using a combination of the greedy approach and local search, where understanding the performance of the local search was the challenging part of the analysis. We study the performance of their local search when applied to general graphs, $C_4$-free graphs, $\{C_3,C_4\}$-free graphs, $C_5$-free graphs, and claw-free graphs. As immediate consequences, we obtain approximation algorithms for the maximum induced matching problem restricted to the $d$-regular graphs in these classes."

The convolution neural network (CNN) based techniques often result in highlighting the most discriminative part of objects while ignoring the entire object extent. Recently, the transformer architecture has been deployed to WSOL to capture the long-range feature dependencies with self-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron structure. Nevertheless, transformers lack the locality inductive bias inherent to CNNs and therefore may deteriorate local feature details in WSOL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework built upon the transformer, termed LCTR (Local Continuity TRansformer), which targets at enhancing the local perception capability of global features among long-range feature dependencies. To this end, we propose a relational patch-attention module (RPAM), which considers cross-patch information on a global basis. We further design a cue digging module (CDM), which utilizes local features to guide the learning trend of the model for highlighting the weak local responses. Finally, comprehensive experiments are carried out on two widely used datasets, ie, CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC, to verify the effectiveness of our method."

Most of the existing state-of-the-art methods would fall short due to massive memory cost and small stroke size when processing ultra-high resolution images. URST completely avoids the memory problem caused by ultra-high resolution images by (1) dividing the image into small patches and (2) performing patch-wise style transfer with a novel Thumbnail Instance Normalization (TIN). Specifically, TIN can extract thumbnail features' normalization statistics and apply them to small patches, ensuring the style consistency among different patches.   Overall, the URST framework has three merits compared to prior arts. (1) We divide input image into small patches and adopt TIN, successfully transferring image style with arbitrary high-resolution. (2) Experiments show that our URST surpasses existing SOTA methods on ultra-high resolution images benefiting from the effectiveness of the proposed stroke perceptual loss in enlarging the stroke size. (3) Our URST can be easily plugged into most existing style transfer methods and directly improve their performance even without training. Code is available at https://git.io/URST."

Data augmentation has been the major approach in improving the robustness against common corruptions. However, the samples produced by popular augmentation strategies deviate significantly from the underlying data manifold. As a result, performance is skewed toward certain types of corruption. To address this issue, we propose a multi-source vicinal transfer augmentation (VITA) method for generating diverse on-manifold samples. The proposed VITA consists of two complementary parts: tangent transfer and integration of multi-source vicinal samples. The tangent transfer creates initial augmented samples for improving corruption robustness. The integration employs a generative model to characterize the underlying manifold built by vicinal samples, facilitating the generation of on-manifold samples. Our proposed VITA significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art augmentation methods, demonstrated in extensive experiments on corruption benchmarks."

In the classical ``incremental'' version of the problem, selected elements remain active until the end of the input sequence. On the other hand, in the fully dynamic version of the problem, elements stay active for a limited time interval, and then leave. This models, for example, the online matching of tasks to workers with task/worker-dependent working times, and sequential posted pricing of perishable goods. A successful approach to online selection problems in the adversarial setting is given by the notion of Online Contention Resolution Scheme (OCRS), that uses a priori information to formulate a linear relaxation of the underlying optimization problem, whose optimal fractional solution is rounded online for any adversarial order of the input sequence. Our main contribution is providing a general method for constructing an OCRS for fully dynamic online selection problems. Then, we show how to employ such OCRS to construct no-regret algorithms in a partial information model with semi-bandit feedback and adversarial inputs."

We approach the problem by learning generative models that can identify anomalies in videos using limited supervision. We propose end-to-end trainable composite Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) networks that are able to predict the evolution of a video sequence from a small number of input frames. Regularity scores are derived from the reconstruction errors of a set of predictions with abnormal video sequences yielding lower regularity scores as they diverge further from the actual sequence over time. The models utilize a composite structure and examine the effects of conditioning in learning more meaningful representations. The best model is chosen based on the reconstruction and prediction accuracy. The Conv-LSTM models are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating competitive results on anomaly detection datasets. Conv-LSTM units are shown to be an effective tool for modeling and predicting video sequences."

While identifiability is trivial when each experiment intervenes on a large number of variables, the situation is more complicated when only one or a few variables are subject to intervention per experiment. For linear causal models with latent variables Hyttinen et al. (2010) gave precise conditions for when such data are sufficient to identify the full model. While their result cannot be extended to discrete-valued variables with arbitrary cause-effect relationships, we show that a similar result can be obtained for the class of causal models whose conditional probability distributions are restricted to a `noisy-OR' parameterization. We further show that identification is preserved under an extension of the model that allows for negative influences, and present learning algorithms that we test for accuracy, scalability and robustness."

Novel GoConv- and GoTConv-based residual blocks are also developed in the encoder and decoder networks. Our scheme also uses a stochastic rounding-based scalar quantization. To further improve the performance, we encode the residual between the input and the reconstructed image from the decoder network as an enhancement layer. To enable a single model to operate with different bit rates and to learn multi-rate image features, a new objective function is introduced. Experimental results show that the proposed framework trained with variable-rate objective function outperforms the standard codecs such as H.265/HEVC-based BPG and state-of-the-art learning-based variable-rate methods."

The architecture of the networks are extended based on the hourglass encoder-decoders. It inputs the original scene text image and outputs the text magnified image while keeps the background unchange. Intermediately, we can get the side-output results of text erasing and text extraction. The four sub-networks are first trained independently and fine-tuned in end-to-end mode. The training samples for each stage are processed through a flow with original image and text annotation in ICDAR2013 and Flickr dataset as input, and corresponding text erased image, magnified text annotation, and text magnified scene image as output. To evaluate the performance of text magnifier, the Structural Similarity is used to measure the regional changes in each character region.

Then we propose a Consensus Encoding Unit (CEU) to construct more distinguishable features for a set of putative correspondences. After that, a Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA) block is adopted to build a classification network for finding good correspondences. Finally, the rotation is obtained by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In this way, the proposed network decouples the estimation of translation and rotation, resulting in better performance for both of them. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DetarNet improves registration performance on both indoor and outdoor scenes. Our code will be available in \url{https://github.com/ZhiChen902/DetarNet}."
299,aaai,2022,ASM2TV: An Adaptive Semi-supervised Multi-Task Multi-View Learning Framework for Human Activity Recognition,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20584,"Teamwork is a set of interrelated reasoning, actions and behaviors of team members that facilitate common objectives. Teamwork theory and experiments have resulted in a set of states and processes for team effectiveness in both human-human and agent-agent teams. However, human-agent teaming is less well studied because it is so new and involves asymmetry in policy and intent not present in human teams. To optimize team performance in human-agent teaming, it is critical that agents infer human intent and adapt their polices for smooth coordination. Most literature in human-agent teaming builds agents referencing a learned human model. Though these agents are guaranteed to perform well with the learned model, they lay heavy assumptions on human policy such as optimality and consistency, which is unlikely in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive agent architecture in human-model-free setting on a two-player cooperative game, namely Team Space Fortress (TSF). Previous human-human team research have shown complementary policies in TSF game and diversity in human players' skill, which encourages us to relax the assumptions on human policy. Therefore, we discard learning human models from human data, and instead use an adaptation strategy on a pre-trained library of exemplar policies composed of RL algorithms or rule-based methods with minimal assumptions of human behavior. The adaptation strategy relies on a novel similarity metric to infer human policy and then selects the most complementary policy in our library to maximize the team performance. The adaptive agent architecture can be deployed in real-time and generalize to any off-the-shelf static agents. We conducted human-agent experiments to evaluate the proposed adaptive agent framework, and demonstrated the suboptimality, diversity, and adaptability of human policies in human-agent teams."

In this work, we propose a novel approach to generative modeling of multimodal data based on generative adversarial networks. To learn a coherent multimodal generative model, we show that it is necessary to align different encoder distributions with the joint decoder distribution simultaneously. To this end, we construct a specific form of the discriminator to enable our model to utilize data efficiently, which can be trained constrastively. By taking advantage of contrastive learning through factorizing the discriminator, we train our model on unimodal data. We have conducted experiments on the benchmark datasets, whose promising results show that our proposed approach outperforms the-state-of-the-art methods on a variety of metrics. The source code will be made publicly available."

Our approach requires that each base learner comes with a candidate regret bound that may or may not hold, while our meta algorithm plays each base learner according to a schedule that keeps the base learner's candidate regret bounds balanced until they are detected to violate their guarantees. We develop careful mis-specification tests specifically designed to blend the above model selection criterion with the ability to leverage the (potentially benign) nature of the environment. We recover the model selection guarantees of the CORRAL algorithm for adversarial environments, but with the additional benefit of achieving high probability regret bounds, specifically in the case of nested adversarial linear bandits. More importantly, our model selection results also hold simultaneously in stochastic environments under gap assumptions. These are the first theoretical results that achieve best of both world (stochastic and adversarial) guarantees while performing model selection in (linear) bandit scenarios."
302,aaai,2022,ContrastNet: A Contrastive Learning Framework for Few-Shot Text Classification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21292,"Recently, more and more research has focused on addressing bias in text classification models. However, existing research mainly focuses on the fairness of monolingual text classification models, and research on fairness for multilingual text classification is still very limited. In this paper, we focus on the task of multilingual text classification and propose a debiasing framework for multilingual text classification based on contrastive learning. Our proposed method does not rely on any external language resources and can be extended to any other languages. The model contains four modules: multilingual text representation module, language fusion module, text debiasing module, and text classification module. The multilingual text representation module uses a multilingual pre-trained language model to represent the text, the language fusion module makes the semantic spaces of different languages tend to be consistent through contrastive learning, and the text debiasing module uses contrastive learning to make the model unable to identify sensitive attributes' information. The text classification module completes the basic tasks of multilingual text classification. In addition, the existing research on the fairness of multilingual text classification is relatively simple in the evaluation mode. The evaluation method of fairness is the same as the monolingual equality difference evaluation method, that is, the evaluation is performed on a single language. We propose a multi-dimensional fairness evaluation framework for multilingual text classification, which evaluates the model's monolingual equality difference, multilingual equality difference, multilingual equality performance difference, and destructiveness of the fairness strategy. We hope that our work can provide a more general debiasing method and a more comprehensive evaluation framework for multilingual text fairness tasks."

The current method based on boundary matching enumerates and calculates all possible boundary matchings to generate proposals. However, these methods neglect the long-range context aggregation in boundary prediction. At the same time, due to the similar semantics of adjacent matchings, local semantic aggregation of densely-generated matchings cannot improve semantic richness and discrimination. In this paper, we propose the end-to-end proposal generation method named Dual Context Aggregation Network (DCAN) to aggregate context on two levels, namely, boundary level and proposal level, for generating high-quality action proposals, thereby improving the performance of temporal action detection. Specifically, we design the Multi-Path Temporal Context Aggregation (MTCA) to achieve smooth context aggregation on boundary level and precise evaluation of boundaries. For matching evaluation, Coarse-to-fine Matching (CFM) is designed to aggregate context on the proposal level and refine the matching map from coarse to fine. We conduct extensive experiments on ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS-14. DCAN obtains an average mAP of 35.39% on ActivityNet v1.3 and reaches mAP 54.14% at IoU@0.5 on THUMOS-14, which demonstrates DCAN can generate high-quality proposals and achieve state-of-the-art performance. We release the code at https://github.com/cg1177/DCAN."
304,aaai,2022,Imagine by Reasoning: A Reasoning-Based Implicit Semantic Data Augmentation for Long-Tailed Classification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19912,"Real-world data often follows a long-tailed distribution, which makes the performance of existing classification algorithms degrade heavily. A key issue is that samples in tail categories fail to depict their intra-class diversity. Humans can imagine a sample in new poses, scenes, and view angles with their prior knowledge even if it is the first time to see this category. Inspired by this, we propose a novel reasoning-based implicit semantic data augmentation method to borrow transformation directions from other classes. Since the covariance matrix of each category represents the feature transformation directions, we can sample new directions from similar categories to generate definitely different instances. Specifically, the long-tailed distributed data is first adopted to train a backbone and a classifier. Then, a covariance matrix for each category is estimated, and a knowledge graph is constructed to store the relations of any two categories. Finally, tail samples are adaptively enhanced via propagating information from all the similar categories in the knowledge graph. Experimental results on CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018 have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

However, current SGG methods usually suffer from sub-optimal scene graph generation because of the long-tailed distribution of training data. To address this problem, we propose Resistance Training using Prior Bias (RTPB) for the scene graph generation. Specifically, RTPB uses a distributed-based prior bias to improve models' detecting ability on less frequent relationships during training, thus improving the model generalizability on tail categories. In addition, to further explore the contextual information of objects and relationships, we design a contextual encoding backbone network, termed as Dual Transformer (DTrans). We perform extensive experiments on a very popular benchmark, VG150, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the unbiased scene graph generation. In specific, our RTPB achieves an improvement of over 10% under the mean recall when applied to current SGG methods. Furthermore, DTrans with RTPB outperforms nearly all state-of-the-art methods with a large margin."
306,aaai,2022,Thrifty Neural Architecture Search for Medical Image Segmentation (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21599,"Semantic segmentation of 3D medical images is a challenging task due to the high variability of the shape and pattern of objects (such as organs or tumors). Given the recent success of deep learning in medical image segmentation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been introduced to find high-performance 3D segmentation network architectures. However, because of the massive computational requirements of 3D data and the discrete optimization nature of architecture search, previous NAS methods require a long search time or necessary continuous relaxation, and commonly lead to sub-optimal network architectures. While one-shot NAS can potentially address these disadvantages, its application in the segmentation domain has not been well studied in the expansive multi-scale multi-path search space. To enable one-shot NAS for medical image segmentation, our method, named HyperSegNAS, introduces a HyperNet to assist super-net training by incorporating architecture topology information. Such a HyperNet can be removed once the super-net is trained and introduces no overhead during architecture search. We show that HyperSegNAS yields better performing and more intuitive architectures compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation networks; furthermore, it can quickly and accurately find good architecture candidates under different computing constraints. Our method is evaluated on public datasets from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, and achieves SOTA performances."

However, among rich information in the facial image, real gaze-relevant features only correspond to subtle changes in eye region, while other gaze-irrelevant features like illumination, personal appearance and even facial expression may affect the learning in an unexpected way. This is a major reason why existing methods show significant performance degradation in cross-domain/dataset evaluation. In this paper, we tackle the cross-domain problem in gaze estimation. Different from common domain adaption methods, we propose a domain generalization method to improve the cross-domain performance without touching target samples. The domain generalization is realized by gaze feature purification. We eliminate gaze-irrelevant factors such as illumination and identity to improve the cross-domain performance. We design a plug-and-play self-adversarial framework for the gaze feature purification. The framework enhances not only our baseline but also existing gaze estimation methods directly and significantly. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose domain generalization methods in gaze estimation. Our method achieves not only state-of-the-art performance among typical gaze estimation methods but also competitive results among domain adaption methods.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the architecture of DNNs has a significant impact on model utility in the context of private deep learning, whereas its effect is largely unexplored in previous studies. In light of this missing, we propose the very first framework that employs neural architecture search to automatic model design for private deep learning, dubbed as DPNAS. To integrate private learning with architecture search, we delicately design a novel search space and propose a DP-aware method for training candidate models. We empirically certify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The searched model DPNASNet achieves state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs, e.g., for the privacy budget of $(\epsilon, \delta)=(3, 1\times10^{-5})$, our model obtains test accuracy of $98.57\%$ on MNIST, $88.09\%$ on FashionMNIST, and $68.33\%$ on CIFAR-10. Furthermore, by studying the generated architectures, we provide several intriguing findings of designing private-learning-friendly DNNs, which can shed new light on model design for deep learning with differential privacy."

In this paper, we propose a new virtual view selection and fusion module for 3D hand pose estimation from single depth.We propose to automatically select multiple virtual viewpoints for pose estimation and fuse the results of all and find this empirically delivers accurate and robust pose estimation. In order to select most effective virtual views for pose fusion, we evaluate the virtual views based on the confidence of virtual views using a light-weight network via network distillation. Experiments on three main benchmark datasets including NYU, ICVL and Hands2019 demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts on NYU and ICVL, and achieves very competitive performance on Hands2019-Task1, and our proposed virtual view selection and fusion module is both effective for 3D hand pose estimation."

While augmentations via interpolating feature-label pairs are effective in classification tasks, they fall short in shape predictions potentially due to inconsistencies between interpolated products of two images and volumes when rendering viewpoints are unknown. PADMix targets this issue with two sets of mixup procedures performed sequentially. We first perform an input mixup which, combined with a pose adaptive learning procedure, is helpful in learning 2D feature extraction and pose adaptive latent encoding. The stagewise training allows us to build upon the pose invariant representations to perform a follow-up latent mixup under one-to-one correspondences between features and ground-truth volumes. PADMix significantly outperforms previous literature on few-shot settings over the ShapeNet dataset and sets new benchmarks on the more challenging real-world Pix3D dataset."

Existing recipe recommendation systems typically focused on content-based or collaborative filtering approaches, ignoring the higher-order collaborative signal such as relational structure information among users, recipes and food items. In this paper, we formalize the problem of recipe recommendation with graphs to incorporate the collaborative signal into recipe recommendation through graph modeling. In particular, we first present URI-Graph, a new and large-scale user-recipe-ingredient graph. We then propose RecipeRec, a novel heterogeneous graph learning model for recipe recommendation. The proposed model can capture recipe content and collaborative signal through a heterogeneous graph neural network with hierarchical attention and an ingredient set transformer. We also introduce a graph contrastive augmentation strategy to extract informative graph knowledge in a self-supervised manner. Finally, we design a joint objective function of recommendation and contrastive learning to optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RecipeRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods for recipe recommendation. Dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/meettyj/RecipeRec."
312,aaai,2022,(2.5+1)D Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs for Video Question Answering,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19922,"Spatio-temporal scene-graph approaches to video-based reasoning tasks, such as video question-answering (QA), typically construct such graphs for every video frame. These approaches often ignore the fact that videos are essentially sequences of 2D ""views"" of events happening in a 3D space, and that the semantics of the 3D scene can thus be carried over from frame to frame. Leveraging this insight, we propose a (2.5+1)D scene graph representation to better capture the spatio-temporal information flows inside the videos. Specifically, we first create a 2.5D (pseudo-3D) scene graph by transforming every 2D frame to have an inferred 3D structure using an off-the-shelf 2D-to-3D transformation module, following which we register the video frames into a shared (2.5+1)D spatio-temporal space and ground each 2D scene graph within it. Such a (2.5+1)D graph is then segregated into a static sub-graph and a dynamic sub-graph, corresponding to whether the objects within them usually move in the world. The nodes in the dynamic graph are enriched with motion features capturing their interactions with other graph nodes. Next, for the video QA task, we present a novel transformer-based reasoning pipeline that embeds the (2.5+1)D graph into a spatio-temporal hierarchical latent space, where the sub-graphs and their interactions are captured at varied granularity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experiments on the NExT-QA and AVSD-QA datasets. Our results show that our proposed (2.5+1)D representation leads to faster training and inference, while our hierarchical model showcases superior performance on the video QA task versus the state of the art."

Instead of preparing a dataset for every language, we demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer learning for zero-shot abusive language detection. This way we can use existing data from higher-resource languages to build better detection systems for low-resource languages. Our datasets are from seven different languages from three language families. We measure the distance between the languages using several language similarity measures, especially by quantifying the World Atlas of Language Structures. We show that there is a correlation between linguistic similarity and classifier performance. This discovery allows us to choose an optimal transfer language for zero shot abusive language detection."

Lately, with RelationalXES a relational database architecture for storing event log data has been introduced. In this technical report, we introduce a mining approach that directly works on relational event data by querying the log with conventional SQL.

However, due to their different modalities and structures, the method of aligning sensor data is the key for successful sensor fusion. To this end, we propose a geometry-aware stereo-LiDAR fusion network for long-range depth estimation, called volumetric propagation network. The key idea of our network is to exploit sparse and accurate point clouds as a cue for guiding correspondences of stereo images in a unified 3D volume space. Unlike existing fusion strategies, we directly embed point clouds into the volume, which enables us to propagate valid information into nearby voxels in the volume, and to reduce the uncertainty of correspondences. Thus, it allows us to fuse two different input modalities seamlessly and regress a long-range depth map. Our fusion is further enhanced by a newly proposed feature extraction layer for point clouds guided by images: FusionConv. FusionConv extracts point cloud features that consider both semantic (2D image domain) and geometric (3D domain) relations and aid fusion at the volume. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI and the Virtual-KITTI datasets among recent stereo-LiDAR fusion methods."
316,aaai,2022,On Testing for Discrimination Using Causal Models,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20494,"While correlation measures are used to discern statistical relationships between observed variables in almost all branches of data-driven scientific inquiry, what we are really interested in is the existence of causal dependence. Designing an efficient causality test, that may be carried out in the absence of restrictive pre-suppositions on the underlying dynamical structure of the data at hand, is non-trivial. Nevertheless, ability to computationally infer statistical prima facie evidence of causal dependence may yield a far more discriminative tool for data analysis compared to the calculation of simple correlations. In the present work, we present a new non-parametric test of Granger causality for quantized or symbolic data streams generated by ergodic stationary sources. In contrast to state-of-art binary tests, our approach makes precise and computes the degree of causal dependence between data streams, without making any restrictive assumptions, linearity or otherwise. Additionally, without any a priori imposition of specific dynamical structure, we infer explicit generative models of causal cross-dependence, which may be then used for prediction. These explicit models are represented as generalized probabilistic automata, referred to crossed automata, and are shown to be sufficient to capture a fairly general class of causal dependence. The proposed algorithms are computationally efficient in the PAC sense; $i.e.$, we find good models of cross-dependence with high probability, with polynomial run-times and sample complexities. The theoretical results are applied to weekly search-frequency data from Google Trends API for a chosen set of socially ""charged"" keywords. The causality network inferred from this dataset reveals, quite expectedly, the causal importance of certain keywords. It is also illustrated that correlation analysis fails to gather such insight."

In this article we analyze the popular collectible card game Hearthstone (Blizzard 2014) and describe a varied set of interesting AI challenges posed by this game. Collectible card games are relatively understudied in the AI community, despite their popularity and the interesting challenges they pose.

Due to the diversity of human languages, texts with the same label in different domains may differ greatly, which brings challenges to the multi-domain text classification. Current advanced methods use the private-shared paradigm, capturing domain-shared features by a shared encoder, and training a private encoder for each domain to extract domain-specific features. However, in realistic scenarios, these methods suffer from inefficiency as new domains are constantly emerging. In this paper, we propose a robust contrastive alignment method to align text classification features of various domains in the same feature space by supervised contrastive learning. By this means, we only need two universal feature extractors to achieve multi-domain text classification. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art method, which uses the complex multi-classifier in a private-shared framework."

Current methods achieve either: (i) disentanglement, which exhibits low visual fidelity and can only be satisfied where the attributes are perfectly uncorrelated. (ii) visually-plausible translations, which are clearly not disentangled. In this work, we propose OverLORD, a single framework for disentangling labeled and unlabeled attributes as well as synthesizing high-fidelity images, which is composed of two stages; (i) Disentanglement: Learning disentangled representations with latent optimization. Differently from previous approaches, we do not rely on adversarial training or any architectural biases. (ii) Synthesis: Training feed-forward encoders for inferring the learned attributes and tuning the generator in an adversarial manner to increase the perceptual quality. When the labeled and unlabeled attributes are correlated, we model an additional representation that accounts for the correlated attributes and improves disentanglement. We highlight that our flexible framework covers multiple settings as disentangling labeled attributes, pose and appearance, localized concepts, and shape and texture. We present significantly better disentanglement with higher translation quality and greater output diversity than state-of-the-art methods."

To extract the swarm behavior, we propose a novel concept of fake news swarming characteristics and design three types of swarm features, including principal component analysis, metric representation, and position encoding. We evaluate our system on a public dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating swarm features in fake news identification, achieving an f1-score and accuracy of over 97% by combining all three types of swarm features. Furthermore, we design an online learning pipeline based on the hypothesis of the temporal distribution pattern of fake news emergence, validated on a topic with early emerging fake news and a shortage of text samples, showing that swarm features can significantly improve recall rates in such cases. Our work provides a new perspective and approach to fake news detection and highlights the importance of considering swarming characteristics in detecting fake news."

This is motivated by the widespread applications of reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world sequential decision making problems, where protecting users' sensitive and private information is becoming paramount. We consider two variants of DP -- joint DP (JDP), where a centralized agent is responsible for protecting users' sensitive data and local DP (LDP), where information needs to be protected directly on the user side. We first propose two general frameworks -- one for policy optimization and another for value iteration -- for designing private, optimistic RL algorithms. We then instantiate these frameworks with suitable privacy mechanisms to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements, and simultaneously obtain sublinear regret guarantees. The regret bounds show that under JDP, the cost of privacy is only a lower order additive term, while for a stronger privacy protection under LDP, the cost suffered is multiplicative. Finally, the regret bounds are obtained by a unified analysis, which, we believe, can be extended beyond tabular MDPs."

The practicality of existing works addressing this challenge is limited to only small-scale synchronous decision-making scenarios or a single agent planning its best response against a single adversary with fixed, procedurally characterized strategies. In contrast this paper considers a more realistic class of problems where a team of asynchronous agents with limited observation and communication capabilities need to compete against multiple strategic adversaries with changing strategies. This problem necessitates agents that can coordinate to detect changes in adversary strategies and plan the best response accordingly. Our approach first optimizes a set of stratagems that represent these best responses. These optimized stratagems are then integrated into a unified policy that can detect and respond when the adversaries change their strategies. The near-optimality of the proposed framework is established theoretically as well as demonstrated empirically in simulation and hardware."

However, this improvement comes at the expense of model explainability. Black-box models make it difficult to understand the internals of a system and the process it takes to arrive at an output. Numerical (LIME, Shapley) and visualization (saliency heatmap) explainability techniques are helpful; however, they are insufficient because they require specialized knowledge. These factors led rationalization to emerge as a more accessible explainable technique in NLP. Rationalization justifies a model's output by providing a natural language explanation (rationale). Recent improvements in natural language generation have made rationalization an attractive technique because it is intuitive, human-comprehensible, and accessible to non-technical users. Since rationalization is a relatively new field, it is disorganized. As the first survey, rationalization literature in NLP from 2007-2022 is analyzed. This survey presents available methods, explainable evaluations, code, and datasets used across various NLP tasks that use rationalization.

325,aaai,2022,Denoised Maximum Classifier Discrepancy for Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19925,"We propose an extended framework for marginalized domain adaptation, aimed at addressing unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised scenarios. We argue that the denoising principle should be extended to explicitly promote domain-invariant features as well as help the classification task. Therefore we propose to jointly learn the data auto-encoders and the target classifiers. First, in order to make the denoised features domain-invariant, we propose a domain regularization that may be either a domain prediction loss or a maximum mean discrepancy between the source and target data. The noise marginalization in this case is reduced to solving the linear matrix system $AX=B$ which has a closed-form solution. Second, in order to help the classification, we include a class regularization term. Adding this component reduces the learning problem to solving a Sylvester linear matrix equation $AX+BX=C$, for which an efficient iterative procedure exists as well. We did an extensive study to assess how these regularization terms improve the baseline performance in the three domain adaptation scenarios and present experimental results on two image and one text benchmark datasets, conventionally used for validating domain adaptation methods. We report our findings and comparison with state-of-the-art methods."
326,aaai,2022,Learning by Competition of Self-Interested Reinforcement Learning Agents,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20589,"Training a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is more challenging than training a single-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, because the result of a multi-agent task strongly depends on the complex interactions among agents and their interactions with a stochastic and dynamic environment. We propose an algorithm that boosts MARL training using the biased action information of other agents based on a friend-or-foe concept. For a cooperative and competitive environment, there are generally two groups of agents: cooperative-agents and competitive-agents. In the proposed algorithm, each agent updates its value function using its own action and the biased action information of other agents in the two groups. The biased joint action of cooperative agents is computed as the sum of their actual joint action and the imaginary cooperative joint action, by assuming all the cooperative agents jointly maximize the target agent's value function. The biased joint action of competitive agents can be computed similarly. Each agent then updates its own value function using the biased action information, resulting in a biased value function and corresponding biased policy. Subsequently, the biased policy of each agent is inevitably subjected to recommend an action to cooperate and compete with other agents, thereby introducing more active interactions among agents and enhancing the MARL policy learning. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in various mixed cooperative-competitive environments. Furthermore, the introduced biases gradually decrease as the training proceeds and the correction based on the imaginary assumption vanishes."
327,aaai,2022,Monotone Abstractions in Ontology-Based Data Management,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20495,"Monotonicity in concurrent systems stipulates that, in any global state, extant system actions remain executable when new processes are added to the state. This concept is not only natural and common in multi-threaded software, but also useful: if every thread's memory is finite, monotonicity often guarantees the decidability of safety property verification even when the number of running threads is unknown. In this paper, we show that the act of obtaining finite-data thread abstractions for model checking can be at odds with monotonicity: Predicate-abstracting certain widely used monotone software results in non-monotone multi-threaded Boolean programs - the monotonicity is lost in the abstraction. As a result, well-established sound and complete safety checking algorithms become inapplicable; in fact, safety checking turns out to be undecidable for the obtained class of unbounded-thread Boolean programs. We demonstrate how the abstract programs can be modified into monotone ones, without affecting safety properties of the non-monotone abstraction. This significantly improves earlier approaches of enforcing monotonicity via overapproximations."
328,aaai,2022,How to Distribute Data across Tasks for Meta-Learning?,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20590,"Meta-learning models transfer the knowledge acquired from previous tasks to quickly learn new ones. They are trained on benchmarks with a fixed number of data points per task. This number is usually arbitrary and it is unknown how it affects performance at testing. Since labelling of data is expensive, finding the optimal allocation of labels across training tasks may reduce costs. Given a fixed budget of labels, should we use a small number of highly labelled tasks, or many tasks with few labels each? Should we allocate more labels to some tasks and less to others? We show that: 1) If tasks are homogeneous, there is a uniform optimal allocation, whereby all tasks get the same amount of data; 2) At fixed budget, there is a trade-off between number of tasks and number of data points per task, with a unique solution for the optimum; 3) When trained separately, harder task should get more data, at the cost of a smaller number of tasks; 4) When training on a mixture of easy and hard tasks, more data should be allocated to easy tasks. Interestingly, Neuroscience experiments have shown that human visual skills also transfer better from easy tasks. We prove these results mathematically on mixed linear regression, and we show empirically that the same results hold for few-shot image classification on CIFAR-FS and mini-ImageNet. Our results provide guidance for allocating labels across tasks when collecting data for meta-learning."

Deep neural network (DNN) based image steganography and watermarking techniques are quickly replacing traditional hand-engineered pipelines. DNN based watermarking techniques have drastically improved the message capacity, imperceptibility and robustness of the embedded watermarks. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational overhead of the watermark encoder neural network. In this work, we design the first accelerator platform FastStamp to perform DNN based steganography and digital watermarking of images on hardware. We first propose a parameter efficient DNN model for embedding recoverable bit-strings in image pixels. Our proposed model can match the success metrics of prior state-of-the-art DNN based watermarking methods while being significantly faster and lighter in terms of memory footprint. We then design an FPGA based accelerator framework to further improve the model throughput and power consumption by leveraging data parallelism and customized computation paths. FastStamp allows embedding hardware signatures into images to establish media authenticity and ownership of digital media. Our best design achieves 68 times faster inference as compared to GPU implementations of prior DNN based watermark encoder while consuming less power."

Existing approaches search globally for the optimal examples to label, scaling linearly or even quadratically with the unlabeled data. In this paper, we improve the computational efficiency of active learning and search methods by restricting the candidate pool for labeling to the nearest neighbors of the currently labeled set instead of scanning over all of the unlabeled data. We evaluate several selection strategies in this setting on three large-scale computer vision datasets: ImageNet, OpenImages, and a de-identified and aggregated dataset of 10 billion images provided by a large internet company. Our approach achieved similar mean average precision and recall as the traditional global approach while reducing the computational cost of selection by up to three orders of magnitude, thus enabling web-scale active learning."
332,aaai,2022,Lower Bounds on Intermediate Results in Bottom-Up Knowledge Compilation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20496,"Bottom-up knowledge compilation is a paradigm for generating representations of functions by iteratively conjoining constraints using a so-called apply function. When the input is not efficiently compilable into a language - generally a class of circuits - because optimal compiled representations are provably large, the problem is not the compilation algorithm as much as the choice of a language too restrictive for the input. In contrast, in this paper, we look at CNF formulas for which very small circuits exists and look at the efficiency of their bottom-up compilation in one of the most general languages, namely that of structured decomposable negation normal forms (str-DNNF). We prove that, while the inputs have constant size representations as str-DNNF, any bottom-up compilation in the general setting where conjunction and structure modification are allowed takes exponential time and space, since large intermediate results have to be produced. This unconditionally proves that the inefficiency of bottom-up compilation resides in the bottom-up paradigm itself."

Additionally, human annotation campaigns are time-consuming and include non-reusable human labour. In practice, researchers rely on automatic metrics as a proxy of quality. In the last decade, many string-based metrics (e.g., BLEU) have been introduced. However, such metrics usually rely on exact matches and thus, do not robustly handle synonyms. In this paper, we introduce InfoLM a family of untrained metrics that can be viewed as a string-based metric that addresses the aforementioned flaws thanks to a pre-trained masked language model. This family of metrics also makes use of information measures allowing the adaptation of InfoLM to various evaluation criteria. Using direct assessment, we demonstrate that InfoLM achieves statistically significant improvement and over $10$ points of correlation gains in many configurations on both summarization and data2text generation."
334,aaai,2022,Model-Based Image Signal Processors via Learnable Dictionaries,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19926,"Digital cameras transform sensor RAW readings into RGB images by means of their Image Signal Processor (ISP). Computational photography tasks such as image denoising and colour constancy are commonly performed in the RAW domain, in part due to the inherent hardware design, but also due to the appealing simplicity of noise statistics that result from the direct sensor readings. Despite this, the availability of RAW images is limited in comparison with the abundance and diversity of available RGB data. Recent approaches have attempted to bridge this gap by estimating the RGB to RAW mapping: handcrafted model-based methods that are interpretable and controllable usually require manual parameter fine-tuning, while end-to-end learnable neural networks require large amounts of training data, at times with complex training procedures, and generally lack interpretability and parametric control. Towards addressing these existing limitations, we present a novel hybrid model-based and data-driven ISP that builds on canonical ISP operations and is both learnable and interpretable. Our proposed invertible model, capable of bidirectional mapping between RAW and RGB domains, employs end-to-end learning of rich parameter representations, i.e. dictionaries, that are free from direct parametric supervision and additionally enable simple and plausible data augmentation. We evidence the value of our data generation process by extensive experiments under both RAW image reconstruction and RAW image denoising tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance in both. Additionally, we show that our ISP can learn meaningful mappings from few data samples, and that denoising models trained with our dictionary-based data augmentation are competitive despite having only few or zero ground-truth labels."

To address these problems, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Contrastive Learning (RHCO) for large-scale heterogeneous graph representation learning. Unlike traditional heterogeneous graph neural networks, we adopt the contrastive learning mechanism to deal with the complex heterogeneity of large-scale heterogeneous graphs. We first learn relation-aware node embeddings under the network schema view. Then we propose a novel positive sample selection strategy to choose meaningful positive samples. After learning node embeddings under the positive sample graph view, we perform a cross-view contrastive learning to obtain the final node representations. Moreover, we adopt the label smoothing technique to boost the performance of RHCO. Extensive experiments on three large-scale academic heterogeneous graph datasets show that RHCO achieves best performance over the state-of-the-art models."
336,aaai,2022,Graph-Wise Common Latent Factor Extraction for Unsupervised Graph Representation Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20593,"Unsupervised graph-level representation learning plays a crucial role in a variety of tasks such as molecular property prediction and community analysis, especially when data annotation is expensive. Currently, most of the best-performing graph embedding methods are based on Infomax principle. The performance of these methods highly depends on the selection of negative samples and hurt the performance, if the samples were not carefully selected. Inter-graph similarity-based methods also suffer if the selected set of graphs for similarity matching is low in quality. To address this, we focus only on utilizing the current input graph for embedding learning. We are motivated by an observation from real-world graph generation processes where the graphs are formed based on one or more global factors which are common to all elements of the graph (e.g., topic of a discussion thread, solubility level of a molecule). We hypothesize extracting these common factors could be highly beneficial. Hence, this work proposes a new principle for unsupervised graph representation learning: Graph-wise Common latent Factor EXtraction (GCFX). We further propose a deep model for GCFX, deepGCFX, based on the idea of reversing the above-mentioned graph generation process which could explicitly extract common latent factors from an input graph and achieve improved results on downstream tasks to the current state-of-the-art. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that, while extracting common latent factors is beneficial for graph-level tasks to alleviate distractions caused by local variations of individual nodes or local neighbourhoods, it also benefits node-level tasks by enabling long-range node dependencies, especially for disassortative graphs."
337,aaai,2022,Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Reward Machines,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20594,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents require the specification of a reward signal for learning behaviours. However, introduction of corrupt or stochastic rewards can yield high variance in learning. Such corruption may be a direct result of goal misspecification, randomness in the reward signal, or correlation of the reward with external factors that are not known to the agent. Corruption or stochasticity of the reward signal can be especially problematic in robotics, where goal specification can be particularly difficult for complex tasks. While many variance reduction techniques have been studied to improve the robustness of the RL process, handling such stochastic or corrupted reward structures remains difficult. As an alternative for handling this scenario in model-free RL methods, we suggest using an estimator for both rewards and value functions. We demonstrate that this improves performance under corrupted stochastic rewards in both the tabular and non-linear function approximation settings for a variety of noise types and environments. The use of reward estimation is a robust and easy-to-implement improvement for handling corrupted reward signals in model-free RL."

Our evaluation of Probabilistic-FF shows its fine scalability in a range of probabilistic domains, constituting a several orders of magnitude improvement over previous results in this area. We use a problematic case to point out the main open issue to be addressed by further research."

Experiments in four language pairs show that Language-Specific encoders-decoders exhibit less bias than the Shared encoder-decoder architecture. Further interpretability analysis of source embeddings and the attention shows that, in the Language-Specific case, the embeddings encode more gender information, and its attention is more diverted. Both behaviors help in mitigating gender bias."

What patterns in global trade networks are shared across classes of goods, and how do these patterns change over time? Answering questions like these requires us to differentially describe groups of graphs: Given a set of graphs and a partition of these graphs into groups, discover what graphs in one group have in common, how they systematically differ from graphs in other groups, and how multiple groups of graphs are related. We refer to this task as graph group analysis, which seeks to describe similarities and differences between graph groups by means of statistically significant subgraphs. To perform graph group analysis, we introduce Gragra, which uses maximum entropy modeling to identify a non-redundant set of subgraphs with statistically significant associations to one or more graph groups. Through an extensive set of experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world graph groups, we confirm that Gragra works well in practice."

(Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21602,"Self-distillation (SD) is the process of first training a \enquote{teacher} model and then using its predictions to train a \enquote{student} model with the \textit{same} architecture. Specifically, the student's objective function is $\big(\xi*\ell(\text{teacher's predictions}, \text{ student's predictions}) + (1-\xi)*\ell(\text{given labels}, \text{ student's predictions})\big)$, where $\ell$ is some loss function and $\xi$ is some parameter $\in [0,1]$. Empirically, SD has been observed to provide performance gains in several settings. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the effect of SD in two supervised learning problems with \textit{noisy labels}. We first analyze SD for regularized linear regression and show that in the high label noise regime, the optimal value of $\xi$ that minimizes the expected error in estimating the ground truth parameter is surprisingly greater than 1. Empirically, we show that $\xi > 1$ works better than $\xi \leq 1$ even with the cross-entropy loss for several classification datasets when 50\% or 30\% of the labels are corrupted. Further, we quantify when optimal SD is better than optimal regularization. Next, we analyze SD in the case of logistic regression for binary classification with random label corruption and quantify the range of label corruption in which the student outperforms the teacher in terms of accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind for the cross-entropy loss."

To fill the gap, we first propose a new game model GSG-I which augments GSGs with sequential movement and the vital element of real-time information. Second, we design a novel deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm, DeDOL, to compute a patrolling strategy that adapts to the real-time information against a best-responding attacker. DeDOL is built upon the double oracle framework and the policy-space response oracle, solving a restricted game and iteratively adding best response strategies to it through training deep Q-networks. Exploring the game structure, DeDOL uses domain-specific heuristic strategies as initial strategies and constructs several local modes for efficient and parallelized training.

The $l_0$-version of untargeted Sparse-RS outperforms all black-box and even all white-box attacks for different models on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Moreover, our untargeted Sparse-RS achieves very high success rates even for the challenging settings of $20\times20$ adversarial patches and $2$-pixel wide adversarial frames for $224\times224$ images.

We propose a time series model that constructs an evolving student state representation using both clickstream data and a signal extracted from the textual notes recorded by human mentors assigned to each student.

In this work, we revisit the core assumption that supports co-training: multiple compatible and conditionally independent views. By theoretically deriving the generalization upper bound, we prove the prediction similarity between two models negatively impacts the model's generalization ability. However, most current co-training models are tightly coupled together and violate this assumption. Such coupling leads to the homogenization of networks and confirmation bias which consequently limits the performance. To this end, we explore different dimensions of co-training and systematically increase the diversity from the aspects of input domains, different augmentations and model architectures to counteract homogenization. Our Diverse Co-training outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin across different evaluation protocols on the Pascal and Cityscapes.

In the large environment, mapping can be significantly accelerated by multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment. Accordingly, a key problem is how to integrate these local maps built by different robots into a single global map. In this paper, we propose an approach for simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps by the robust motion averaging. The main idea of this approach is to recover all global motions for map merging from a set of relative motions. Therefore, it firstly adopts the pair-wise map merging method to estimate relative motions for grid map pairs. To obtain as many reliable relative motions as possible, a graph-based sampling scheme is utilized to efficiently remove unreliable relative motions obtained from the pair-wise map merging. Subsequently, the accurate global motions can be recovered from the set of reliable relative motions by the motion averaging. Experimental results carried on real robot data sets demonstrate that proposed approach can achieve simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps with good performances."

In particular, optimization and design of biological sequences with specific functional or structural properties have a profound impact in medicine, materials science, and biotechnology. Standalone search algorithms, such as simulated annealing (SA) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), are typically used for such optimization problems. In order to improve the performance and sample efficiency of such algorithms, we propose to use existing methods in conjunction with a surrogate model for the black-box evaluations over purely categorical variables. To this end, we present two different representations, a group-theoretic Fourier expansion and an abridged one-hot encoded Boolean Fourier expansion. To learn such representations, we consider two different settings to update our surrogate model. First, we utilize an adversarial online regression setting where Fourier characters of each representation are considered as experts and their respective coefficients are updated via an exponential weight update rule each time the black box is evaluated. Second, we consider a Bayesian setting where queries are selected via Thompson sampling and the posterior is updated via a sparse Bayesian regression model (over our proposed representation) with a regularized horseshoe prior. Numerical experiments over synthetic benchmarks as well as real-world RNA sequence optimization and design problems demonstrate the representational power of the proposed methods, which achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art counterparts, while improving the computation cost and/or sample efficiency, substantially."

The most important step in the evaluation of object detection algorithm is calculating the intersection-over-union (IoU) between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth one. Although this procedure is well-defined and solved for planar images, it is not easy for spherical image object detection. Existing methods either compute the IoUs based on biased bounding box representations or make excessive approximations, thus would give incorrect results. In this paper, we first identify that spherical rectangles are unbiased bounding boxes for objects in spherical images, and then propose an analytical method for IoU calculation without any approximations. Based on the unbiased representation and calculation, we also present an anchor free object detection algorithm for spherical images. The experiments on two spherical object detection datasets show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than existing methods."

In this work, we show that data heterogeneity can in fact be exploited to improve generalization performance through implicit regularization. One way to alleviate the effects of heterogeneity is to encourage the alignment of gradients across different clients throughout training. Our analysis reveals that this goal can be accomplished by utilizing the right optimization method that replicates the implicit regularization effect of SGD, leading to gradient alignment as well as improvements in test accuracies. Since the existence of this regularization in SGD completely relies on the sequential use of different mini-batches during training, it is inherently absent when training with large mini-batches. To obtain the generalization benefits of this regularization while increasing parallelism, we propose a novel GradAlign algorithm that induces the same implicit regularization while allowing the use of arbitrarily large batches in each update. We experimentally validate the benefits of our algorithm in different distributed and federated learning settings."

Recently, there have been several proposals for how to design objectives for these systems that attempt to achieve some combination of fairness, efficiency, incentive compatibility, and satisfactory aggregation of stakeholder preferences. This paper lays out possible roles and opportunities for AI in this domain, arguing for a closer engagement with the political philosophy literature on local justice, which provides a framework for thinking about how societies have over time framed objectives for such allocation problems. It also discusses how we may be able to integrate into this framework the opportunities and risks opened up by the ubiquity of data and the availability of algorithms that can use them to make accurate predictions about the future."

As one of the interpretable and reliable models with good prediction ability, we consider Sparse High-order Interaction Model (SHIM) in this study. However, finding statistically significant high-order interactions is challenging due to the intrinsic high dimensionality of the combinatorial effects. Another problem in data-driven modeling is the effect of ""cherry-picking"" a.k.a. selection bias. Our main contribution is to extend the recently developed parametric programming approach for selective inference to high-order interaction models. Exhaustive search over the cherry tree (all possible interactions) can be daunting and impractical even for a small-sized problem. We introduced an efficient pruning strategy and demonstrated the computational efficiency and statistical power of the proposed method using both synthetic and real data."
357,aaai,2022,Conditional Synthetic Data Generation for Robust Machine Learning Applications with Limited Pandemic Data,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21435,"$\textbf{Background:}$ At the onset of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, data with proper labeling/attributes corresponding to the new disease might be unavailable or sparse. Machine Learning (ML) models trained with the available data, which is limited in quantity and poor in diversity, will often be biased and inaccurate. At the same time, ML algorithms designed to fight pandemics must have good performance and be developed in a time-sensitive manner. To tackle the challenges of limited data, and label scarcity in the available data, we propose generating conditional synthetic data, to be used alongside real data for developing robust ML models. $\textbf{Methods:}$ We present a hybrid model consisting of a conditional generative flow and a classifier for conditional synthetic data generation. The classifier decouples the feature representation for the condition, which is fed to the flow to extract the local noise. We generate synthetic data by manipulating the local noise with fixed conditional feature representation. We also propose a semi-supervised approach to generate synthetic samples in the absence of labels for a majority of the available data. $\textbf{Results:}$ We performed conditional synthetic generation for chest computed tomography (CT) scans corresponding to normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia afflicted patients. We show that our method significantly outperforms existing models both on qualitative and quantitative performance, and our semi-supervised approach can efficiently synthesize conditional samples under label scarcity. As an example of downstream use of synthetic data, we show improvement in COVID-19 detection from CT scans with conditional synthetic data augmentation."

While it supports the tracking of the ever-growing number of aircraft in the air, it also introduces cybersecurity issues that must be mitigated e.g., false data injection attacks where an attacker emits fake surveillance information. The recent data sources and tools available to obtain flight tracking records allow the researchers to create datasets and develop Machine Learning models capable of detecting such anomalies in En-Route trajectories. In this context, we propose a novel multivariate anomaly detection model called Discriminatory Auto-Encoder (DAE). It uses the baseline of a regular LSTM-based auto-encoder but with several decoders, each getting data of a specific flight phase (e.g. climbing, cruising or descending) during its training.To illustrate the DAE's efficiency, an evaluation dataset was created using real-life anomalies as well as realistically crafted ones, with which the DAE as well as three anomaly detection models from the literature were evaluated. Results show that the DAE achieves better results in both accuracy and speed of detection. The dataset, the models implementations and the evaluation results are available in an online repository, thereby enabling replicability and facilitating future experiments."
359,aaai,2022,How Good Are Low-Rank Approximations in Gaussian Process Regression?,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20598,Learning in Gaussian Process models occurs through the adaptation of hyperparameters of the mean and the covariance function. The classical approach entails maximizing the marginal likelihood yielding fixed point estimates (an approach called \textit{Type II maximum likelihood} or ML-II). An alternative learning procedure is to infer the posterior over hyperparameters in a hierarchical specification of GPs we call \textit{Fully Bayesian Gaussian Process Regression} (GPR). This work considers two approximation schemes for the intractable hyperparameter posterior: 1) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) yielding a sampling-based approximation and 2) Variational Inference (VI) where the posterior over hyperparameters is approximated by a factorized Gaussian (mean-field) or a full-rank Gaussian accounting for correlations between hyperparameters. We analyze the predictive performance for fully Bayesian GPR on a range of benchmark data sets.
360,aaai,2022,KOALA: A Kalman Optimization Algorithm with Loss Adaptivity,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20599,"Optimization is often cast as a deterministic problem, where the solution is found through some iterative procedure such as gradient descent. However, when training neural networks the loss function changes over (iteration) time due to the randomized selection of a subset of the samples. This randomization turns the optimization problem into a stochastic one. We propose to consider the loss as a noisy observation with respect to some reference optimum. This interpretation of the loss allows us to adopt Kalman filtering as an optimizer, as its recursive formulation is designed to estimate unknown parameters from noisy measurements. Moreover, we show that the Kalman Filter dynamical model for the evolution of the unknown parameters can be used to capture the gradient dynamics of advanced methods such as Momentum and Adam. We call this stochastic optimization method KOALA, which is short for Kalman Optimization Algorithm with Loss Adaptivity. KOALA is an easy to implement, scalable, and efficient method to train neural networks. We provide convergence analysis and show experimentally that it yields parameter estimates that are on par with or better than existing state of the art optimization algorithms across several neural network architectures and machine learning tasks, such as computer vision and language modeling."

It has many applications in various disciplines, such as statistics, economics, operations research, and electrical engineering. Computing the least squares (LS) estimator via solving a quadratic program (QP) is the most common technique to fit a piecewise-linear convex function to the observed data. Since the number of constraints in the QP formulation increases quadratically in N, the number of observed data points, computing the LS estimator is not practical using interior point methods when N is very large. The first-order method proposed in this paper carefully manages the memory usage through parallelization, and efficiently solves large-scale instances of CR."
362,aaai,2022,Gradient Temporal Difference with Momentum: Stability and Convergence,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20601,"Temporal difference learning with linear function approximation is a popular method to obtain a low-dimensional approximation of the value function of a policy in a Markov Decision Process. We give a new interpretation of this method in terms of a splitting of the gradient of an appropriately chosen function. As a consequence of this interpretation, convergence proofs for gradient descent can be applied almost verbatim to temporal difference learning. Beyond giving a new, fuller explanation of why temporal difference works, our interpretation also yields improved convergence times. We consider the setting with $1/\sqrt{T}$ step-size, where previous comparable finite-time convergence time bounds for temporal difference learning had the multiplicative factor $1/(1-\gamma)$ in front of the bound, with $\gamma$ being the discount factor. We show that a minor variation on TD learning which estimates the mean of the value function separately has a convergence time where $1/(1-\gamma)$ only multiplies an asymptotically negligible term."
363,aaai,2022,Distillation of RL Policies with Formal Guarantees via Variational Abstraction of Markov Decision Processes,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20602,"We consider the challenge of policy simplification and verification in the context of policies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous environments. In well-behaved settings, RL algorithms have convergence guarantees in the limit. While these guarantees are valuable, they are insufficient for safety-critical applications. Furthermore, they are lost when applying advanced techniques such as deep-RL. To recover guarantees when applying advanced RL algorithms to more complex environments with (i) reachability, (ii) safety-constrained reachability, or (iii) discounted-reward objectives, we build upon the DeepMDP framework introduced by Gelada et al. to derive new bisimulation bounds between the unknown environment and a learned discrete latent model of it. Our bisimulation bounds enable the application of formal methods for Markov decision processes. Finally, we show how one can use a policy obtained via state-of-the-art RL to efficiently train a variational autoencoder that yields a discrete latent model with provably approximately correct bisimulation guarantees. Additionally, we obtain a distilled version of the policy for the latent model."

It takes time to eat each piece of pizza and both players eat pizza at the same rate. One is allowed to take a next piece only after the person has finished eating the piece on hand. Also, after the first piece is taken, one can only take a piece which is adjacent to already-taken piece. This paper shows that, in this real time setting, the starting player can always eat at least two-fifth of the total size of the pizza. However, this may not be the best possible amount the starting player can eat. It is a modified problem from an original one where two players takes piece alternatively instead."

We mainly focus on the fundamental case where a set of agents are positioned in the line segment [0,1] and have approval preferences over two available facilities. A mechanism takes as input the positions and the preferences of the agents, and chooses to locate a single facility based on this information. We study mechanisms that aim to maximize the social welfare (the total utility the agents derive from facilities they approve), under the constraint of incentivizing the agents to truthfully report their positions and preferences. We consider three different settings depending on the level of agent-related information that is public or private. For each setting, we design deterministic and randomized strategyproof mechanisms that achieve a good approximation of the optimal social welfare, and complement these with nearly-tight impossibility results."

Previously, Machine Learning (ML) has been largely applied to solve combinatorial optimization problems by learning effective heuristics. However, existing ML-based heuristic methods are often not generalizable to different search algorithms. Most importantly, these methods usually require full knowledge about the problems to be solved, which are not suitable for distributed settings where centralization is not realistic due to geographical limitations or privacy concerns. To address the generality issue, we propose a novel directed acyclic graph representation schema for DCOPs and leverage the Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to embed graph representations. Our model, GAT-PCM, is then pretrained with optimally labelled data in an offline manner, so as to construct effective heuristics to boost a broad range of DCOP algorithms where evaluating the quality of a partial assignment is critical, such as local search or backtracking search. Furthermore, to enable decentralized model inference, we propose a distributed embedding schema of GAT-PCM where each agent exchanges only embedded vectors, and show its soundness and complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by combining it with a local search or a backtracking search algorithm. Extensive empirical evaluations indicate that the GAT-PCM-boosted algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in various benchmarks. The pretrained model is available at https://github.com/dyc941126/GAT-PCM."

Our approach learns with three complementary forms of self-supervision: (1) reconstruction of masked audio and video input data, (2) intra- and inter-modal contrastive learning with masking, and (3) self-training by reconstructing joint audio-video contextualized features learned from the first two objectives. Pre-training with MAViL not only enables the model to perform well in audio-visual classification and retrieval tasks but also improves representations of each modality in isolation, without using information from the other modality for fine-tuning or inference. Empirically, MAViL sets a new state-of-the-art on AudioSet (53.1 mAP) and VGGSound (67.1% accuracy). For the first time, a self-supervised audio-visual model outperforms ones that use external supervision on these benchmarks."

Among image composition tasks, image blending aims to seamlessly blend an object from a source image onto a target image with lightly mask adjustment. A popular approach is Poisson image blending, which enforces the gradient domain smoothness in the composite image. However, this approach only considers the boundary pixels of target image, and thus can not adapt to texture of target image. In addition, the colors of the target image often seep through the original source object too much causing a significant loss of content of the source object. We propose a Poisson blending loss that achieves the same purpose of Poisson image blending. In addition, we jointly optimize the proposed Poisson blending loss as well as the style and content loss computed from a deep network, and reconstruct the blending region by iteratively updating the pixels using the L-BFGS solver. In the blending image, we not only smooth out gradient domain of the blending boundary but also add consistent texture into the blending region. User studies show that our method outperforms strong baselines as well as state-of-the-art approaches when placing objects onto both paintings and real-world images."

Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21300,"Sarcasm is a pervading linguistic phenomenon and highly challenging to explain due to its subjectivity, lack of context and deeply-felt opinion. In the multimodal setup, sarcasm is conveyed through the incongruity between the text and visual entities. Although recent approaches deal with sarcasm as a classification problem, it is unclear why an online post is identified as sarcastic. Without proper explanation, end users may not be able to perceive the underlying sense of irony. In this paper, we propose a novel problem -- Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE) -- given a multimodal sarcastic post containing an image and a caption, we aim to generate a natural language explanation to reveal the intended sarcasm. To this end, we develop MORE, a new dataset with explanation of 3510 sarcastic multimodal posts. Each explanation is a natural language (English) sentence describing the hidden irony. We benchmark MORE by employing a multimodal Transformer-based architecture. It incorporates a cross-modal attention in the Transformer's encoder which attends to the distinguishing features between the two modalities. Subsequently, a BART-based auto-regressive decoder is used as the generator. Empirical results demonstrate convincing results over various baselines (adopted for MuSE) across five evaluation metrics. We also conduct human evaluation on predictions and obtain Fleiss' Kappa score of 0.4 as a fair agreement among 25 evaluators."

For example, placement of functional blocks in hardware design to optimize performance via simulations. The overall goal is to minimize the number of function evaluations to find high-performing permutations. The key challenge in solving this problem using the Bayesian optimization (BO) framework is to trade-off the complexity of statistical model and tractability of acquisition function optimization. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two algorithms for BO over Permutation Spaces (BOPS). First, BOPS-T employs Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model with Kendall kernels and a Tractable acquisition function optimization approach based on Thompson sampling to select the sequence of permutations for evaluation. Second, BOPS-H employs GP surrogate model with Mallow kernels and a Heuristic search approach to optimize expected improvement acquisition function. We theoretically analyze the performance of BOPS-T to show that their regret grows sub-linearly. Our experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that both BOPS-T and BOPS-H perform better than the state-of-the-art BO algorithm for combinatorial spaces. To drive future research on this important problem, we make new resources and real-world benchmarks available to the community."

It is a laborious human activity comprised of repeated decision making: the human labeler decides which of several potential labels to apply to each example. Prior work has shown that providing AI assistance can improve the accuracy of binary decision tasks. However, the role of AI assistance in more complex data-labeling scenarios with a larger set of labels has not yet been explored. We designed an AI labeling assistant that uses a semi-supervised learning algorithm to predict the most probable labels for each example. We leverage these predictions to provide assistance in two ways: (i) providing a label recommendation and (ii) reducing the labeler's decision space by focusing their attention on only the most probable labels. We conducted a user study (n=54) to evaluate an AI-assisted interface for data labeling in this context. Our results highlight that the AI assistance improves both labeler accuracy and speed, especially when the labeler finds the correct label in the reduced label space. We discuss findings related to the presentation of AI assistance and design implications for intelligent labeling interfaces."

To automatically utilize their semantic information, graph neural architecture search has recently been developed on various tasks of HINs. Existing works, on the other hand, show weaknesses in instability and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Partial Message Meta Multigraph search (PMMM) to automatically optimize the neural architecture design on HINs. Specifically, to learn how graph neural networks (GNNs) propagate messages along various types of edges, PMMM adopts an efficient differentiable framework to search for a meaningful meta multigraph, which can capture more flexible and complex semantic relations than a meta graph. The differentiable search typically suffers from performance instability, so we further propose a stable algorithm called partial message search to ensure that the searched meta multigraph consistently surpasses the manually designed meta-structures, i.e., meta-paths. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets over two representative tasks, including node classification and recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art heterogeneous GNNs, finds out meaningful meta multigraphs, and is significantly more stable."

Previous studies have shown that word embeddings trained on human-generated corpora have strong gender biases that can produce discriminative results in downstream tasks. Previous debiasing methods focus mainly on modeling bias and only implicitly consider semantic information while completely overlooking the complex underlying causal structure among bias and semantic components. To address these issues, we propose a novel methodology that leverages a causal inference framework to effectively remove gender bias. The proposed method allows us to construct and analyze the complex causal mechanisms facilitating gender information flow while retaining oracle semantic information within word embeddings. Our comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in gender-debiasing tasks. In addition, our methods yield better performance in word similarity evaluation and various extrinsic downstream NLP tasks."

To further improve the robustness and achieve accurate optical flow estimation, we present PRAFlow (Pyramid Recurrent All-Pairs Flow), which builds upon the pyramid network structure. Due to computational limitation, our proposed network structure only uses two pyramid layers. At each layer, the RAFT unit is used to estimate the optical flow at the current resolution.

Current audits for fairness are limited to coarse-grained parity assessments at the level of sensitive groups. We propose to audit for envy-freeness, a more granular criterion aligned with individual preferences: every user should prefer their recommendations to those of other users. Since auditing for envy requires to estimate the preferences of users beyond their existing recommendations, we cast the audit as a new pure exploration problem in multi-armed bandits. We propose a sample-efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees that it does not deteriorate user experience. We also study the trade-offs achieved on real-world recommendation datasets."

Most of the research and development efforts have been concentrated on improving the performance of the fraud scoring models. Yet, the downstream fraud alert systems still have limited to no model adoption and rely on manual steps. Alert systems are pervasively used across all payment channels in retail banking and play an important role in the overall fraud detection process. Current fraud detection systems end up with large numbers of dropped alerts due to their inability to account for the alert processing capacity. Ideally, alert threshold selection enables the system to maximize the fraud detection while balancing the upstream fraud scores and the available bandwidth of the alert processing teams. However, in practice, fixed thresholds that are used for their simplicity do not have this ability. In this paper, we propose an enhanced threshold selection policy for fraud alert systems. The proposed approach formulates the threshold selection as a sequential decision making problem and uses Deep Q-Network based reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that this adaptive approach outperforms the current static solutions by reducing the fraud losses as well as improving the operational efficiency of the alert system."

To solve the complex scale variations, single-shot detectors make scale-aware predictions based on multiple pyramid layers. However, the features in the pyramid are not scale-aware enough, which limits the detection performance. Two common problems in single-shot detectors caused by object scale variations can be observed: (1) small objects are easily missed; (2) the salient part of a large object is sometimes detected as an object. With this observation, we propose a new Neighbor Erasing and Transferring (NET) mechanism to reconfigure the pyramid features and explore scale-aware features. In NET, a Neighbor Erasing Module (NEM) is designed to erase the salient features of large objects and emphasize the features of small objects in shallow layers. A Neighbor Transferring Module (NTM) is introduced to transfer the erased features and highlight large objects in deep layers. With this mechanism, a single-shot network called NETNet is constructed for scale-aware object detection. In addition, we propose to aggregate nearest neighboring pyramid features to enhance our NET. NETNet achieves 38.5% AP at a speed of 27 FPS and 32.0% AP at a speed of 55 FPS on MS COCO dataset. As a result, NETNet achieves a better trade-off for real-time and accurate object detection."

Therefore, early diagnosis and medical treatment of sepsis in critically ill populations at high risk for sepsis and sepsis-associated mortality are vital to providing the patient with rapid therapy. Studies show that advancing sepsis detection by 6 hours leads to earlier administration of antibiotics, which is associated with improved mortality. However, clinical scores like Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) are not applicable for early prediction, while machine learning algorithms can help capture the progressing pattern for early prediction. Therefore, we aim to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts sepsis onset 6 hours before it is suspected clinically. Although some machine learning algorithms have been applied to sepsis prediction, many of them did not consider the fact that six hours is not a small gap. To overcome this big gap challenge, we explore a multi-subset approach in which the likelihood of sepsis occurring earlier than 6 hours is output from a previous subset and feed to the target subset as additional features. Moreover, we use the hourly sampled data like vital signs in an observation window to derive a temporal change trend to further assist, which however is often ignored by previous studies. Our empirical study shows that both the multi-subset approach to alleviating the 6-hour gap and the added temporal trend features can help improve the performance of sepsis-related early prediction."
381,aaai,2022,An Optimal Transport Approach to Deep Metric Learning (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21604,"Deep metric learning is essential for visual recognition. The widely used pair-wise (or triplet) based loss objectives cannot make full use of semantical information in training samples or give enough attention to those hard samples during optimization. Thus, they often suffer from a slow convergence rate and inferior performance. In this paper, we show how to learn an importance-driven distance metric via optimal transport programming from batches of samples. It can automatically emphasize hard examples and lead to significant improvements in convergence. We propose a new batch-wise optimal transport loss and combine it in an end-to-end deep metric learning manner. We use it to learn the distance metric and deep feature representation jointly for recognition. Empirical results on visual retrieval and classification tasks with six benchmark datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR10, SHREC13, SHREC14, ModelNet10, and ModelNet40, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. It can accelerate the convergence rate significantly while achieving a state-of-the-art recognition performance. For example, in 3D shape recognition experiments, we show that our method can achieve better recognition performance within only 5 epochs than what can be obtained by mainstream 3D shape recognition approaches after 200 epochs."

Prior works that incorporate external knowledge bases have shown promising results, but knowledge bases are expensive to construct and are often limited to a fixed set of relations. In this paper, we instead focus on better utilizing the \textit{implicit knowledge} stored in pre-trained language models. While researchers have found that the knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models can be extracted by having them fill in the blanks of carefully designed prompts for relation extraction and text classification, it remains unclear if we can adopt this paradigm in CQA where the inputs and outputs take much more flexible forms. To this end, we investigate four translation methods that can translate natural questions into cloze-style sentences to better solicit commonsense knowledge from language models, including a syntactic-based model, an unsupervised neural model, and two supervised neural models. In addition, to combine the different translation methods, we propose to encourage consistency among model predictions on different translated questions with unlabeled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on three CQA datasets in zero-shot settings. We show that our methods are complementary to a knowledge base improved model, and combining them can lead to state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Analyses also reveal distinct characteristics of the different cloze translation methods and provide insights on why combining them can lead to great improvements."

Using COVID-19 chest X-rays, we present a method for interpreting what a CNN has learned by utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our GAN framework disentangles lung structure from COVID-19 features. Using this GAN, we can visualize the transition of a pair of COVID negative lungs in a chest radiograph to a COVID positive pair by interpolating in the latent space of the GAN, which provides fine-grained visualization of how the CNN responds to varying features within the lungs."
385,aaai,2022,Disentangled Spatiotemporal Graph Generative Models,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20607,"Spatiotemporal graph represents a crucial data structure where the nodes and edges are embedded in a geometric space and can evolve dynamically over time. Nowadays, spatiotemporal graph data is becoming increasingly popular and important, ranging from microscale (e.g. protein folding), to middle-scale (e.g. dynamic functional connectivity), to macro-scale (e.g. human mobility network). Although disentangling and understanding the correlations among spatial, temporal, and graph aspects have been a long-standing key topic in network science, they typically rely on network processing hypothesized by human knowledge. This usually fit well towards the graph properties which can be predefined, but cannot do well for the most cases, especially for many key domains where the human has yet very limited knowledge such as protein folding and biological neuronal networks. In this paper, we aim at pushing forward the modeling and understanding of spatiotemporal graphs via new disentangled deep generative models. Specifically, a new Bayesian model is proposed that factorizes spatiotemporal graphs into spatial, temporal, and graph factors as well as the factors that explain the interplay among them. A variational objective function and new mutual information thresholding algorithms driven by information bottleneck theory have been proposed to maximize the disentanglement among the factors with theoretical guarantees. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-arts by up to 69.2% for graph generation and 41.5% for interpretability."
386,aaai,2022,Synthetic Disinformation Attacks on Automated Fact Verification Systems,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21302,"Automated fact-checking is a needed technology to curtail the spread of online misinformation. One current framework for such solutions proposes to verify claims by retrieving supporting or refuting evidence from related textual sources. However, the realistic use cases for fact-checkers will require verifying claims against evidence sources that could be affected by the same misinformation. Furthermore, the development of modern NLP tools that can produce coherent, fabricated content would allow malicious actors to systematically generate adversarial disinformation for fact-checkers.   In this work, we explore the sensitivity of automated fact-checkers to synthetic adversarial evidence in two simulated settings: AdversarialAddition, where we fabricate documents and add them to the evidence repository available to the fact-checking system, and AdversarialModification, where existing evidence source documents in the repository are automatically altered. Our study across multiple models on three benchmarks demonstrates that these systems suffer significant performance drops against these attacks. Finally, we discuss the growing threat of modern NLG systems as generators of disinformation in the context of the challenges they pose to automated fact-checkers."
387,aaai,2022,Towards Debiasing DNN Models from Spurious Feature Influence,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21185,"Debiasing language models from unwanted behaviors in Natural Language Understanding tasks is a topic with rapidly increasing interest in the NLP community. Spurious statistical correlations in the data allow models to perform shortcuts and avoid uncovering more advanced and desirable linguistic features. A multitude of effective debiasing approaches has been proposed, but flexibility remains a major issue. For the most part, models must be retrained to find a new set of weights with debiased behavior. We propose a new debiasing method in which we identify debiased pruning masks that can be applied to a finetuned model. This enables the selective and conditional application of debiasing behaviors. We assume that bias is caused by a certain subset of weights in the network; our method is, in essence, a mask search to identify and remove biased weights. Our masks show equivalent or superior performance to the standard counterparts, while offering important benefits. Pruning masks can be stored with high efficiency in memory, and it becomes possible to switch among several debiasing behaviors (or revert back to the original biased model) at inference time. Finally, it opens the doors to further research on how biases are acquired by studying the generated masks. For example, we observed that the early layers and attention heads were pruned more aggressively, possibly hinting towards the location in which biases may be encoded."

Given the triplet training corpus $\langle speech, transcription, translation\rangle$, the conventional high-quality E2E-ST system leverages the $\langle speech, transcription\rangle$ pair to pre-train the model and then utilizes the $\langle speech, translation\rangle$ pair to optimize it further. However, this process only involves two-tuple data at each stage, and this loose coupling fails to fully exploit the association between triplet data. In this paper, we attempt to model the joint probability of transcription and translation based on the speech input to directly leverage such triplet data. Based on that, we propose a novel regularization method for model training to improve the agreement of dual-path decomposition within triplet data, which should be equal in theory. To achieve this goal, we introduce two Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization terms into the model training objective to reduce the mismatch between output probabilities of dual-path. Then the well-trained model can be naturally transformed as the E2E-ST models by the pre-defined early stop tag. Experiments on the MuST-C benchmark demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art E2E-ST baselines on all 8 language pairs, while achieving better performance in the automatic speech recognition task. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/duyichao/E2E-ST-TDA."

For different motion completion scenarios (in-betweening, in-filling, and blending), most previous methods deal with the completion problems with case-by-case designs. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method to solve multiple motion completion problems under a unified framework and achieves a new state of the art accuracy under multiple evaluation settings. Inspired by the recent great success of attention-based models, we consider the completion as a sequence to sequence prediction problem. Our method consists of two modules - a standard transformer encoder with self-attention that learns long-range dependencies of input motions, and a trainable mixture embedding module that models temporal information and discriminates key-frames. Our method can run in a non-autoregressive manner and predict multiple missing frames within a single forward propagation in real time. We finally show the effectiveness of our method in music-dance applications."

Accurate predictions require a deep understanding of various contextual elements that potentially impact the way pedestrians behave. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that relies on different data modalities to predict future trajectories and crossing actions of pedestrians from an ego-centric perspective. Specifically, our model utilizes a cross-modal Transformer architecture to capture dependencies between different data types. The output of the Transformer is augmented with representations of interactions between pedestrians and other traffic agents conditioned on the pedestrian and ego-vehicle dynamics that are generated via a semantic attentive interaction module. Lastly, the context encodings are fed into a multi-stream decoder framework using a gated-shared network. We evaluate our algorithm on public pedestrian behavior benchmarks, PIE and JAAD, and show that our model improves state-of-the-art in trajectory and action prediction by up to 22% and 13% respectively on various metrics. The advantages brought by components of our model are investigated via extensive ablation studies."

Additionally, most financial regulators also require a liquidity horizon of several days for institutional investors to exit their risky assets, in order to not materially affect market prices. However, the task of multi-step stock price prediction is challenging, given the highly stochastic nature of stock data. Current solutions to tackle this problem are mostly designed for single-step, classification-based predictions, and are limited to low representation expressiveness. The problem also gets progressively harder with the introduction of the target price sequence, which also contains stochastic noise and reduces generalizability at test-time. To tackle these issues, we combine a deep hierarchical variational-autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion probabilistic techniques to do seq2seq stock prediction through a stochastic generative process. The hierarchical VAE allows us to learn the complex and low-level latent variables for stock prediction, while the diffusion probabilistic model trains the predictor to handle stock price stochasticity by progressively adding random noise to the stock data. Our Diffusion-VAE (D-Va) model is shown to outperform state-of-the-art solutions in terms of its prediction accuracy and variance. More importantly, the multi-step outputs can also allow us to form a stock portfolio over the prediction length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model outputs in the portfolio investment task through the Sharpe ratio metric and highlight the importance of dealing with different types of prediction uncertainties."
392,aaai,2022,Learning from the Dark: Boosting Graph Convolutional Neural Networks with Diverse Negative Samples,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20608,"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning by extracting high-level features from nodes and their topology. Since GCNs generally follow a message-passing mechanism, each node aggregates information from its first-order neighbour to update its representation. As a result, the representations of nodes with edges between them should be positively correlated and thus can be considered positive samples. However, there are more non-neighbour nodes in the whole graph, which provide diverse and useful information for the representation update. Two non-adjacent nodes usually have different representations, which can be seen as negative samples. Besides the node representations, the structural information of the graph is also crucial for learning. In this paper, we used quality-diversity decomposition in determinant point processes (DPP) to obtain diverse negative samples. When defining a distribution on diverse subsets of all non-neighbouring nodes, we incorporate both graph structure information and node representations. Since the DPP sampling process requires matrix eigenvalue decomposition, we propose a new shortest-path-base method to improve computational efficiency. Finally, we incorporate the obtained negative samples into the graph convolution operation. The ideas are evaluated empirically in experiments on node classification tasks. These experiments show that the newly proposed methods not only improve the overall performance of standard representation learning but also significantly alleviate over-smoothing problems."
393,aaai,2022,A Tale of Color Variants: Representation and Self-Supervised Learning in Fashion E-commerce,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21516,"In this paper, we address a crucial problem in fashion e-commerce (with respect to customer experience, as well as revenue): color variants identification, i.e., identifying fashion products that match exactly in their design (or style), but only to differ in their color. We propose a generic framework, that leverages deep visual Representation Learning at its heart, to address this problem for our fashion e-commerce platform. Our framework could be trained with supervisory signals in the form of triplets, that are obtained manually. However, it is infeasible to obtain manual annotations for the entire huge collection of data usually present in fashion e-commerce platforms, such as ours, while capturing all the difficult corner cases. But, to our rescue, interestingly we observed that this crucial problem in fashion e-commerce could also be solved by simple color jitter based image augmentation, that recently became widely popular in the contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) literature, that seeks to learn visual representations without using manual labels. This naturally led to a question in our mind: Could we leverage SSL in our use-case, and still obtain comparable performance to our supervised framework? The answer is, Yes! because, color variant fashion objects are nothing but manifestations of a style, in different colors, and a model trained to be invariant to the color (with, or without supervision), should be able to recognize this! This is what the paper further demonstrates, both qualitatively, and quantitatively, while evaluating a couple of state-of-the-art SSL techniques, and also proposing a novel method."

Our approach makes known algorithms defined for restricted fragments generally applicable, at a computational cost that scales with the distance from the fragment. Thus, in a certain sense, we gradually augment tractable fragments. Surprisingly, it turns out that some tractable fragments admit such an augmentation and that others do not.   More specifically, we show that the problems of credulous and skeptical acceptance are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the distance from the fragment of acyclic argumentation frameworks. Other tractable fragments such as the fragments of symmetrical and bipartite frameworks seem to prohibit an augmentation: the acceptance problems are already intractable for frameworks at distance 1 from the fragments.   For our study we use a broad setting and consider several different semantics. For the algorithmic results we utilize recent advances in fixed-parameter tractability."

We initiate the study of a learning-augmented variant of the classical, notoriously hard online graph exploration problem by adding access to machine-learned predictions. We propose an algorithm that naturally integrates predictions into the well-known Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm and significantly outperforms any known online algorithm if the prediction is of high accuracy while maintaining good guarantees when the prediction is of poor quality. We provide theoretical worst-case bounds that gracefully degrade with the prediction error, and we complement them by computational experiments that confirm our results. Further, we extend our concept to a general framework to robustify algorithms. By interpolating carefully between a given algorithm and NN, we prove new performance bounds that leverage the individual good performance on particular inputs while establishing robustness to arbitrary inputs."

With this principle in mind, we introduce new reference-free summary evaluation metrics that use a pretrained language model to estimate the information content shared between a document and its summary. These metrics are a modern take on the Shannon Game, a method for summary quality scoring proposed decades ago, where we replace human annotators with language models. We also view these metrics as an extension of BLANC, a recently proposed approach to summary quality measurement based on the performance of a language model with and without the help of a summary. Using transformer based language models, we empirically verify that our metrics achieve state-of-the-art correlation with human judgement of the summary quality dimensions of both coherence and relevance, as well as competitive correlation with human judgement of consistency and fluency."

However, in many cases, these models do not perform well when labeled data is scarce and the model is expected to perform in the zero or few shot setting. Recently, several works have shown that continual pretraining or performing a second phase of pretraining (inter-training) which is better aligned with the downstream task, can lead to improved results, especially in the scarce data setting. Here, we propose to leverage sentiment-carrying discourse markers to generate large-scale weakly-labeled data, which in turn can be used to adapt language models for sentiment analysis. Extensive experimental results show the value of our approach on various benchmark datasets, including the finance domain. Code, models and data are available at https://github.com/ibm/tslm-discourse-markers."
398,aaai,2022,Large-Neighbourhood Search for Optimisation in Answer-Set Solving,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20502,"Deep Optimisation (DO) combines evolutionary search with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in a novel way - not for optimising a learning algorithm, but for finding a solution to an optimisation problem. Deep learning has been successfully applied to classification, regression, decision and generative tasks and in this paper we extend its application to solving optimisation problems. Model Building Optimisation Algorithms (MBOAs), a branch of evolutionary algorithms, have been successful in combining machine learning methods and evolutionary search but, until now, they have not utilised DNNs. DO is the first algorithm to use a DNN to learn and exploit the problem structure to adapt the variation operator (changing the neighbourhood structure of the search process). We demonstrate the performance of DO using two theoretical optimisation problems within the MAXSAT class. The Hierarchical Transformation Optimisation Problem (HTOP) has controllable deep structure that provides a clear evaluation of how DO works and why using a layerwise technique is essential for learning and exploiting problem structure. The Parity Modular Constraint Problem (MCparity) is a simplistic example of a problem containing higher-order dependencies (greater than pairwise) which DO can solve and state of the art MBOAs cannot. Further, we show that DO can exploit deep structure in TSP instances. Together these results show that there exists problems that DO can find and exploit deep problem structure that other algorithms cannot. Making this connection between DNNs and optimisation allows for the utilisation of advanced tools applicable to DNNs that current MBOAs are unable to use."

We apply these techniques to hedging procedures in order to compute the sensitivity of SDE trajectories with respect to parameter perturbations. We show that this analysis can justify endogenously the presence of a bid-ask spread on the option prices. We also prove that if the stochastic differential equation admits a closed form representation then the sensitivities have closed form representations. We examine the case of log-normal diffusion and we show that this framework leads to a smiled implied volatility surface coherent with historical data."
400,aaai,2022,Complexity of Deliberative Coalition Formation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20428,"Elkind et al. (AAAI, 2021) introduced a model for deliberative coalition formation, where a community wishes to identify a strongly supported proposal from a space of alternatives, in order to change the status quo. In their model, agents and proposals are points in a metric space, agents' preferences are determined by distances, and agents deliberate by dynamically forming coalitions around proposals that they prefer over the status quo. The deliberation process operates via k-compromise transitions, where agents from k (current) coalitions come together to form a larger coalition in order to support a (perhaps new) proposal, possibly leaving behind some of the dissenting agents from their old coalitions. A deliberation succeeds if it terminates by identifying a proposal with the largest possible support. For deliberation in d dimensions, Elkind et al. consider two variants of their model: in the Euclidean model, proposals and agent locations are points in R^d and the distance is measured according to ||...||_2; and in the hypercube model, proposals and agent locations are vertices of the d-dimensional hypercube and the metric is the Hamming distance. They show that in the continuous model 2-compromises are guaranteed to succeed, but in the discrete model for deliberation to succeed it may be necessary to use k-compromises with k >= d. We complement their analysis by (1) proving that in both models it is hard to find a proposal with a high degree of support, and even a 2-compromise transition may be hard to compute; (2) showing that a sequence of 2-compromise transitions may be exponentially long; (3) strengthening the lower bound on the size of the compromise for the d-hypercube model from d to 2^{\Omega(d)}."
401,aaai,2022,Answering Queries with Negation over Existential Rules,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20503,"Ontology-based query answering with existential rules is well understood and implemented for positive queries, in particular conjunctive queries. The situation changes drastically for queries with negation, where there is no agreed-upon semantics or standard implementation. Stratification, as used for Datalog, is not enough for existential rules, since the latter still admit multiple universal models that can differ on negative queries. We therefore propose universal core models as a basis for a meaningful (non-monotonic) semantics for queries with negation. Since cores are hard to compute, we identify syntactic descriptions of queries that can equivalently be answered over other types of models. This leads to fragments of queries with negation that can safely be evaluated by current chase implementations. We establish new techniques to estimate how the core model differs from other universal models, and we incorporate our findings into a new reasoning approach for existential rules with negation."
402,aaai,2022,Adaptive and Universal Algorithms for Variational Inequalities with Optimal Convergence,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20609,"We develop new adaptive algorithms for variational inequalities with monotone operators, which capture many problems of interest, notably convex optimization and convex-concave saddle point problems. Our algorithms automatically adapt to unknown problem parameters such as the smoothness and the norm of the operator, and the variance of the stochastic evaluation oracle. We show that our algorithms are universal and simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rates in the non-smooth, smooth, and stochastic settings. The convergence guarantees of our algorithms improve over existing adaptive methods by a $\Omega(\sqrt{\ln T})$ factor, matching the optimal non-adaptive algorithms. Additionally, prior works require that the optimization domain is bounded. In this work, we remove this restriction and give algorithms for unbounded domains that are adaptive and universal. Our general proof techniques can be used for many variants of the algorithm using one or two operator evaluations per iteration. The classical methods based on the ExtraGradient/MirrorProx algorithm require two operator evaluations per iteration, which is the dominant factor in the running time in many settings."

In order to adapt to novel zero-shot tasks, our meta-learner learns from the model parameters of known tasks (with ground truth) and the correlation of known tasks to zero-shot tasks. Such intuition finds its foothold in cognitive science, where a subject (human baby) can adapt to a novel-concept (depth understanding) by correlating it with old concepts (hand movement or self-motion), without receiving explicit supervision. We evaluated our model on the Taskonomy dataset, with four tasks as zero-shot: surface-normal, room layout, depth, and camera pose estimation. These tasks were chosen based on the data acquisition complexity and the complexity associated with the learning process using a deep network. Our proposed methodology out-performs state-of-the-art models (which use ground truth)on each of our zero-shot tasks, showing promise on zero-shot task transfer. We also conducted extensive experiments to study the various choices of our methodology, as well as showed how the proposed method can also be used in transfer learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstsuch effort on zero-shot learning in the task space."

However, naively training unstructured sparse NNs from random initialization results in significantly worse generalization, with the notable exceptions of Lottery Tickets (LTs) and Dynamic Sparse Training (DST). Through our analysis of gradient flow during training we attempt to answer: (1) why training unstructured sparse networks from random initialization performs poorly and; (2) what makes LTs and DST the exceptions? We show that sparse NNs have poor gradient flow at initialization and demonstrate the importance of using sparsity-aware initialization. Furthermore, we find that DST methods significantly improve gradient flow during training over traditional sparse training methods. Finally, we show that LTs do not improve gradient flow, rather their success lies in re-learning the pruning solution they are derived from - however, this comes at the cost of learning novel solutions."

To incorporate mixed frequency information without directly modeling them, we target a low frequency diffusion index that is already available, and treat high frequency values as missing. We impute these values using multiple factors estimated from the high frequency data. In the empirical examples considered, static matrix completion that does not account for serial correlation in the idiosyncratic errors yields imprecise estimates of the missing values irrespective of how the factors are estimated. Single equation and systems-based dynamic procedures that account for serial correlation yield imputed values that are closer to the observed low frequency ones. This is the case in the counterfactual exercise that imputes the monthly values of consumer sentiment series before 1978 when the data was released only on a quarterly basis. This is also the case for a weekly version of the CFNAI index of economic activity that is imputed using seasonally unadjusted data. The imputed series reveals episodes of increased variability of weekly economic information that are masked by the monthly data, notably around the 2014-15 collapse in oil prices."

Although many models have been proposed and have achieved good performance by learning short-range local features, long-range contextual properties have often been neglected. Moreover, the model size has also become a bottleneck for their wide applications. To overcome these challenges, we propose a super light-weight network model termed SVT-Net for large scale place recognition. Specifically, on top of the highly efficient 3D Sparse Convolution (SP-Conv), an Atom-based Sparse Voxel Transformer (ASVT) and a Cluster-based Sparse Voxel Transformer (CSVT) are proposed to learn both short-range local features and long-range contextual features in this model. Consisting of ASVT and CSVT, SVT-Net can achieve state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets in terms of both accuracy and speed with a super-light model size (0.9M). Meanwhile, two simplified versions of SVT-Net are introduced, which also achieve state-of-the-art and further reduce the model size to 0.8M and 0.4M respectively."

These definitions build on the notion of unfolding of aggregates, and they are aimed at creating methodologies to translate logic programs with aggregates to normal logic programs or positive programs, whose answer set semantics can be used to defined the semantics of the original programs. The first definition provides an alternative view of the semantics for logic programming with aggregates described by Pelov et al.   The second definition is similar to the traditional answer set definition for normal logic programs, in that, given a logic program with aggregates and an interpretation, the unfolding process produces a positive program. The paper shows how this definition can be extended to consider aggregates in the head of the rules.   The proposed views of logic programming with aggregates are simple and coincide with the ultimate stable model semantics, and with other semantic characterizations for large classes of program (e.g., programs with monotone aggregates and programs that are aggregate-stratified).   Moreover, it can be directly employed to support an implementation using available answer set solvers. The paper describes a system, called ASP^A, that is capable of computing answer sets of programs with arbitrary (e.g., recursively defined) aggregates."

However, existing medical image-text joint learning methods are limited by instance or local supervision analysis, ignoring disease-level semantic correspondences. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Granularity Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA) framework for generalized medical visual representation learning by harnessing the naturally exhibited semantic correspondences between medical image and radiology reports at three different levels, i.e., pathological region-level, instance-level, and disease-level. Specifically, we first incorporate the instance-wise alignment module by maximizing the agreement between image-report pairs. Further, for token-wise alignment, we introduce a bidirectional cross-attention strategy to explicitly learn the matching between fine-grained visual tokens and text tokens, followed by contrastive learning to align them. More important, to leverage the high-level inter-subject relationship semantic (e.g., disease) correspondences, we design a novel cross-modal disease-level alignment paradigm to enforce the cross-modal cluster assignment consistency. Extensive experimental results on seven downstream medical image datasets covering image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the stable and superior performance of our framework."

However, DNN models are vulnerable to different types of adversarial attacks, which pose significant risks to the security and safety of the vehicles and passengers. One prominent threat is the backdoor attack, where the adversary can compromise the DNN model by poisoning the training samples. Although lots of effort has been devoted to the investigation of the backdoor attack to conventional computer vision tasks, its practicality and applicability to the autonomous driving scenario is rarely explored, especially in the physical world.   In this paper, we target the lane detection system, which is an indispensable module for many autonomous driving tasks, e.g., navigation, lane switching. We design and realize the first physical backdoor attacks to such system. Our attacks are comprehensively effective against different types of lane detection algorithms. Specifically, we introduce two attack methodologies (poison-annotation and clean-annotation) to generate poisoned samples. With those samples, the trained lane detection model will be infected with the backdoor, and can be activated by common objects (e.g., traffic cones) to make wrong detections, leading the vehicle to drive off the road or onto the opposite lane. Extensive evaluations on public datasets and physical autonomous vehicles demonstrate that our backdoor attacks are effective, stealthy and robust against various defense solutions.

Here we propose a blind/no-reference OIQA method named S$^2$ that bridges the gap between low-level statistics and high-level semantics of omnidirectional images. Specifically, statistic and semantic features are extracted in separate paths from multiple local viewports and the hallucinated global omnidirectional image, respectively. A quality regression along with a weighting process is then followed that maps the extracted quality-aware features to a perceptual quality prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed S$^2$ method offers highly competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods."
414,aaai,2022,Learning to Learn Transferable Attack,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19936,"Despite of the pervasive existence of multi-label evasion attack, it is an open yet essential problem to characterize the origin of the adversarial vulnerability of a multi-label learning system and assess its attackability. In this study, we focus on non-targeted evasion attack against multi-label classifiers. The goal of the threat is to cause miss-classification with respect to as many labels as possible, with the same input perturbation. Our work gains in-depth understanding about the multi-label adversarial attack by first characterizing the transferability of the attack based on the functional properties of the multi-label classifier. We unveil how the transferability level of the attack determines the attackability of the classifier via establishing an information-theoretic analysis of the adversarial risk. Furthermore, we propose a transferability-centered attackability assessment, named Soft Attackability Estimator (SAE), to evaluate the intrinsic vulnerability level of the targeted multi-label classifier. This estimator is then integrated as a transferability-tuning regularization term into the multi-label learning paradigm to achieve adversarially robust classification. The experimental study on real-world data echos the theoretical analysis and verify the validity of the transferability-regularized multi-label learning method."

Unfortunately, these signal processing algorithms are often poorly suited to run on embedded hardware accelerators used in automobiles. Conversely, end-to-end machine learning (ML) approaches better exploit the performance gains brought by specialized accelerators. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student knowledge distillation approach for low-level radar perception tasks. We utilize a hybrid model for stationary object detection as a teacher to train an end-to-end ML student model. The student can efficiently harness embedded compute for real-time deployment. We demonstrate that the proposed student model runs at speeds 100x faster than the teacher model."
416,aaai,2022,Molecular Contrastive Learning with Chemical Element Knowledge Graph,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20313,"Molecular representation learning contributes to multiple downstream tasks such as molecular property prediction and drug design. To properly represent molecules, graph contrastive learning is a promising paradigm as it utilizes self-supervision signals and has no requirements for human annotations. However, prior works fail to incorporate fundamental domain knowledge into graph semantics and thus ignore the correlations between atoms that have common attributes but are not directly connected by bonds. To address these issues, we construct a Chemical Element Knowledge Graph (KG) to summarize microscopic associations between elements and propose a novel Knowledge-enhanced Contrastive Learning (KCL) framework for molecular representation learning. KCL framework consists of three modules. The first module, knowledge-guided graph augmentation, augments the original molecular graph based on the Chemical Element KG. The second module, knowledge-aware graph representation, extracts molecular representations with a common graph encoder for the original molecular graph and a Knowledge-aware Message Passing Neural Network (KMPNN) to encode complex information in the augmented molecular graph. The final module is a contrastive objective, where we maximize agreement between these two views of molecular graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrated that KCL obtained superior performances against state-of-the-art baselines on eight molecular datasets. Visualization experiments properly interpret what KCL has learned from atoms and attributes in the augmented molecular graphs. Our codes and data are available at https://github.com/ZJU-Fangyin/KCL."

Being based on noisy gradients obtained via back-propagation such methods require the application of regularization strategies. We present a mathematical framework unifying previously employed regularization methods. Within this framework, we propose a novel technique based on Sobolev gradients which can be implemented via convolutions and does not require specialized numerical treatment, such as total variation regularization. The experiments performed on feature inversion and activation maximization demonstrate the benefit of a unified approach to regularization, such as sharper reconstructions via the proposed Sobolev filters and a better control over reconstructed scales."

The model captures students interactions with the online platform. The data model is platform agnostic and is based on some basic core actions that students take on an online learning platform. Students usually interact with the platform in four different modes: Observing, Submitting, Collaborating and giving feedback. In observing mode students are simply browsing the online platform, watching videos, reading material, reading book or watching forums. In submitting mode, students submit information to the platform. This includes submissions towards quizzes, homeworks, or any assessment modules. In collaborating mode students interact with other students or instructors on forums, collaboratively editing wiki or chatting on google hangout or other hangout venues. With this basic definitions of activities, and a data model to store events pertaining to these activities, we then create a common terminology to map Coursera and edX data into this shared data model. This shared data model called MOOCdb becomes the foundation for a number of collaborative frameworks that enable progress in data science without the need to share the data."
419,aaai,2022,Fast Payoff Matrix Sparsification Techniques for Structured Extensive-Form Games,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20431,"The practical scalability of many optimization algorithms for large extensive-form games is often limited by the games' huge payoff matrices. To ameliorate the issue, Zhang and Sandholm (2020) recently proposed a sparsification technique that factorizes the payoff matrix $\mathbf{A}$ into a sparser object $\mathbf{A} = \hat{\mathbf{A}} + \mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^\top$, where the total combined number of nonzeros of $\hat{\mathbf{A}}$, $\mathbf{U}$, and $\mathbf{V}$ is significantly smaller. Such a factorization can be used in place of the original payoff matrix in many optimization algorithm, such as interior-point and second-order methods, thus increasing the size of games that can be handled. Their technique significantly sparsifies poker (end)games, standard benchmarks used in computational game theory, AI, and more broadly. We show that the existence of extremely sparse factorizations in poker games can be tied to their particular \emph{Kronecker-product} structure. We clarify how such structure arises and introduce the connection between that structure and sparsification. By leveraging such structure, we give two ways of computing strong sparsifications of poker games (as well as any other game with a similar structure) that are i) orders of magnitude faster to compute, ii) more numerically stable, and iii) produce a dramatically smaller number of nonzeros than the prior technique. Our techniques enable -- for the first time -- effective computation of high-precision Nash equilibria and strategies subject to constraints on the amount of allowed randomization. Furthermore, they significantly speed up parallel first-order game-solving algorithms; we show state-of-the-art speed on a GPU."

However, few studies have provided flexible solutions to identifying a person in an image containing arbitrary part of the body. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate matching method to address this problem. The proposed method leverages Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to generate fix-sized spatial feature maps such that pixel-level features are consistent. To match a pair of person images of different sizes, a novel method called Deep Spatial feature Reconstruction (DSR) is further developed to avoid explicit alignment. Specifically, DSR exploits the reconstructing error from popular dictionary learning models to calculate the similarity between different spatial feature maps. In that way, we expect that the proposed FCN can decrease the similarity of coupled images from different persons and increase that from the same person. Experimental results on two partial person datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with several state-of-the-art partial person re-id approaches. Additionally, DSR achieves competitive results on a benchmark person dataset Market1501 with 83.58\% Rank-1 accuracy."

As an example, manipulative or deceptive behaviour can improve rewards but should be avoided. Most approaches fail here: agents maximize expected return by any means necessary. We formally describe settings with 'delicate' parts of the state which should not be used as a means to an end. We then train agents to maximize the causal effect of actions on the expected return which is not mediated by the delicate parts of state, using Causal Influence Diagram analysis. The resulting agents have no incentive to control the delicate state. We further show how our framework unifies and generalizes existing proposals."

There are coherence relationships among adjacent images because they often describe same entities or events. These relationships are important for entity-aware multi-image captioning, but are neglected in entity-aware single-image captioning. Most existing work focuses on single-image captioning, while multi-image captioning has not been explored before. Hence, this paper proposes a coherent entity-aware multi-image captioning model by making use of coherence relationships. The model consists of a Transformer-based caption generation model and two types of contrastive learning-based coherence mechanisms. The generation model generates the caption by paying attention to the image and the accompanying text. The horizontal coherence mechanism aims to the make the caption coherent with captions of adjacent images. The vertical coherence mechanism aims to make the caption coherent with the image and the accompanying text. To evaluate coherence between captions, two coherence evaluation metrics are proposed. The new dataset DM800K is constructed that has more images per document than two existing datasets GoodNews and NYT800K, and are more suitable for multi-image captioning. Experiments on three datasets show the proposed captioning model outperforms 6 baselines according to single-image captioning evaluations, and the generated captions are more coherent than that of baselines according to coherence evaluations and human evaluations."

Fifty data sets, each containing 26 alphabets written by various people, are used for training the neural network and 570 different handwritten alphabetical characters are used for testing. The proposed recognition system performs quite well yielding higher levels of recognition accuracy compared to the systems employing the conventional horizontal and vertical methods of feature extraction.

The key challenge is to ensure their correct functioning w.r.t. safety requirements. Promising techniques to ensure safety seem to be model-driven engineering to develop hybrid systems in a well-defined and traceable manner, and formal verification to prove their correctness. Their combination forms the vision of verification-driven engineering. Often, hybrid systems are rather complex in that they require expertise from many domains (e.g., robotics, control systems, computer science, software engineering, and mechanical engineering). Moreover, despite the remarkable progress in automating formal verification of hybrid systems, the construction of proofs of complex systems often requires nontrivial human guidance, since hybrid systems verification tools solve undecidable problems. It is, thus, not uncommon for development and verification teams to consist of many players with diverse expertise. This paper introduces a verification-driven engineering toolset that extends our previous work on hybrid and arithmetic verification with tools for (i) graphical (UML) and textual modeling of hybrid systems, (ii) exchanging and comparing models and proofs, and (iii) managing verification tasks. This toolset makes it easier to tackle large-scale verification tasks."

The most attractive aspect of federated learning is its ability to decompose model training into a centralized server and distributed nodes without collecting private data. This kind of decomposed learning framework has great potential to protect users' privacy and sensitive data. Therefore, federated learning combines naturally with an open banking data marketplaces. This chapter will discuss the possible challenges for applying federated learning in the context of open banking, and the corresponding solutions have been explored as well."

It is widely known that CNN is deemed as a 'black-box', which is hard for understanding the prediction mechanism and debugging the wrong prediction. Some model debugging and explanation works are developed for solving the above drawbacks. However, those methods focus on explanation and diagnosing possible causes for model prediction, based on which the researchers handle the following optimization of models manually. In this paper, we propose the first completely automatic model diagnosing and treating tool, termed as Model Doctor. Based on two discoveries that 1) each category is only correlated with sparse and specific convolution kernels, and 2) adversarial samples are isolated while normal samples are successive in the feature space, a simple aggregate gradient constraint is devised for effectively diagnosing and optimizing CNN classifiers. The aggregate gradient strategy is a versatile module for mainstream CNN classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Model Doctor applies to all existing CNN classifiers, and improves the accuracy of $16$ mainstream CNN classifiers by 1%-5%."

We study a unique gender bias in image search in this work: the search images are often gender-imbalanced for gender-neutral natural language queries. We diagnose two typical image search models, the specialized model trained on in-domain datasets and the generalized representation model pre-trained on massive image and text data across the internet. Both models suffer from severe gender bias. Therefore, we introduce two novel debiasing approaches: an in-processing fair sampling method to address the gender imbalance issue for training models, and a post-processing feature clipping method base on mutual information to debias multimodal representations of pre-trained models. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks show that our methods significantly reduce the gender bias in image search models."

State-of-the-art approaches generally leverage the topological structure of the Twittersphere, while they neglect the heterogeneity of relations and influence among users. In this paper, we propose a novel bot detection framework to alleviate this problem, which leverages the topological structure of user-formed heterogeneous graphs and models varying influence intensity between users. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous information network with users as nodes and diversified relations as edges. We then propose relational graph transformers to model heterogeneous influence between users and learn node representations. Finally, we use semantic attention networks to aggregate messages across users and relations and conduct heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive Twitter bot detection benchmark. Additional studies also bear out the effectiveness of our proposed relational graph transformers, semantic attention networks and the graph-based approach in general."

However, these methods suffer from limited performance because of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework, termed \textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the representation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in KerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which significantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional GNN models."

It draws from the experience gained in the early to mid 1990's on flaw selection strategies for POCL planning, and combines this with more recent developments in the field of domain independent planning such as distance based heuristics and reachability analysis. We present an adaptation of the additive heuristic for plan space planning, and modify it to account for possible reuse of existing actions in a plan. We also propose a large set of novel flaw selection strategies, and show how these can help us solve more problems than previously possible by POCL planners. VHPOP also supports planning with durative actions by incorporating standard techniques for temporal constraint reasoning. We demonstrate that the same heuristic techniques used to boost the performance of classical POCL planning can be effective in domains with durative actions as well. The result is a versatile heuristic POCL planner competitive with established CSP-based and heuristic state space planners."

For Noetherian local rings, we analyze whether the completion map is Ohm-Rush. We show that the answer is typically `yes' in dimension one, but `no' in higher dimension, and in any case it coincides with the content map having good algebraic properties. We then analyze the question of when the Ohm-Rush property globalizes in faithfully flat modules and algebras over a 1-dimensional Noetherian domain, culminating both in a positive result and a counterexample. Finally, we introduce a notion that we show is strictly between the Ohm-Rush property and the weak content algebra property."

In this paper, we propose a neural EL model that trains fine-grained similarities and dissimilarities between the query and candidate document from multiple perspectives, combined with convolution and tensor networks. Further, we show that this English-trained system can be applied, in zero-shot learning, to other languages by making surprisingly effective use of multi-lingual embeddings.

The limitation is due to the restricted model architecture related to fixed input and output dimensions. This hinders the experience accumulation and transfer of the learned agent over tasks with diverse levels of difficulty (e.g. 3 vs 3 or 5 vs 6 multi-agent games). In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore a universal multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline, designing one single architecture to fit tasks with the requirement of different observation and action configurations. Unlike previous RNN-based models, we utilize a transformer-based model to generate a flexible policy by decoupling the policy distribution from the intertwined input observation with an importance weight measured by the merits of the self-attention mechanism. Compared to a standard transformer block, the proposed model, named as Universal Policy Decoupling Transformer (UPDeT), further relaxes the action restriction and makes the multi-agent task's decision process more explainable. UPDeT is general enough to be plugged into any multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline and equip them with strong generalization abilities that enables the handling of multiple tasks at a time. Extensive experiments on large-scale SMAC multi-agent competitive games demonstrate that the proposed UPDeT-based multi-agent reinforcement learning achieves significant results relative to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating advantageous transfer capability in terms of both performance and training speed (10 times faster)."

We assess the problem of classifying such documents. After identifying and evaluating several quantifiable features of academic papers, we apply methods from machine learning to build a binary classifier. In tests with two hundred papers, the resulting classifier correctly labeled papers either as human written or as computer generated with no false classifications of computer generated papers as human and a 2% false classification rate for human papers as computer generated. We believe generalizations of these features are applicable to similar classification problems. While most current text-based spam detection techniques focus on the keyword-based classification of email messages, a new generation of unsolicited computer-generated advertisements masquerade as legitimate postings in online groups, message boards and social news sites. Our results show that taking the formatting and contextual clues offered by these environments into account may be of central importance when selecting features with which to identify such unwanted postings."

A key challenge in dynamic symbolic execution is how to effectively explore the program's execution paths to achieve high code coverage in a limited time budget. Dynamic symbolic execution employs a search heuristic to address this challenge, which favors exploring particular types of paths that are most likely to maximize the final coverage. However, manually designing a good search heuristic is nontrivial and typically ends up with suboptimal and unstable outcomes. The goal of this paper is to overcome this shortcoming of dynamic symbolic execution by automatically learning search heuristics. We define a class of search heuristics, namely a parametric search heuristic, and present an algorithm that efficiently finds an optimal heuristic for each subject program. Experimental results with industrial-strength symbolic execution tools (e.g., KLEE) show that our technique can successfully generate search heuristics that significantly outperform existing manually-crafted heuristics in terms of branch coverage and bug-finding."

Under such a scenario, the impact of corruption level on the asymptotic regret is carefully characterized. In particular, our theoretical analysis reveals a phase transition phenomenon that, when the corruption level $\omega$ is below a critical order (i.e., small-$\omega$ regime), the asymptotic regret remains the same; when it is beyond that order (i.e., large-$\omega$ regime), the asymptotic regret deteriorates polynomially. Surprisingly, we obtain a negative result that the classical noise-injection approach will not help improve the testing performance in the beginning stage of the large-$\omega$ regime, even in the level of the multiplicative constant of asymptotic regret. As a technical by-product, we prove that under different model assumptions, the pre-processed 1-NN proposed in \cite{xue2017achieving} will at most achieve a sub-optimal rate when the data dimension $d>4$ even if $k$ is chosen optimally in the pre-processing step."

However, automation alert/alarm systems often apply a low-beta threshold to avoid misses and generates excessive false alarms. This study proposed an adaptive hazard diagnosis and alarm system with adjustable alert threshold levels based on environmental scenarios and operator's hazard recognition performance. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) data during hazard recognition tasks. The linear ballistic accumulator model was used to decompose the response time into several psychological subcomponents, which were further estimated by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and compared among different types of hazardous scenarios. Participants were most cautious about falling hazards, followed by electricity hazards, and had the least conservative attitude toward structural hazards. Participants were classified into three performance-level subgroups using a latent profile analysis based on task accuracy. We applied the transfer learning paradigm to classify subgroups based on their time-frequency representations of EEG data. Additionally, two continual learning strategies were investigated to ensure a robust adaptation of the model to predict participants' performance levels in different hazardous scenarios. These findings can be leveraged in real-world brain-computer interface applications, which will provide human trust in automation and promote the successful implementation of alarm technologies."

Yet, the manual, ad-hoc nature of game testing leaves space for automation. In this paper, we research, design, and implement an approach to supplement game testing to balance video games with autonomous agents. We evaluate our approach with two platform games. We bring a systematic way to assess if a game is balanced by (1) comparing the difficulty levels between game versions and issues with the game design, and (2) the game demands for skill or luck."

Multiple Python packages were developed and integrated within the Flood Analytics Information System (FAIS). FAIS workflow includes the use of IoTs-APIs and various machine learning approaches for transmitting, processing, and loading big data through which the application gathers information from various data servers and replicates it to a data warehouse (IBM database service). Users are allowed to directly stream and download flood related images/videos from the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Department of Transportation (DOT) and save the data on a local storage. The outcome of the river measurement, imagery, and tabular data is displayed on a web based remote dashboard and the information can be plotted in real-time. FAIS proved to be a robust and user-friendly tool for flood data analysis at regional scale that could help stakeholders for rapid assessment of flood situation and damages. FAIS also provides flood frequency analysis (FFA) to estimate flood quantiles including the associated uncertainties that combine the elements of observational analysis, stochastic probability distribution and design return periods. FAIS is publicly available and deployed on the Clemson-IBM cloud service."

Here, complementing classic work where the clusters shall be cliques, we focus on clusters that shall be 2-clubs, that is, subgraphs of diameter two. This naturally leads to the two NP-hard problems 2-Club Cluster Editing (the allowed editing operations are edge insertion and edge deletion) and 2-Club Cluster Vertex Deletion (the allowed editing operations are vertex deletions). Answering an open question from the literature, we show that 2-Club Cluster Editing is W[2]-hard with respect to the number of edge modifications, thus contrasting the fixed-parameter tractability result for the classic Cluster Editing problem (considering cliques instead of 2-clubs). Then focusing on 2-Club Cluster Vertex Deletion, which is easily seen to be fixed-parameter tractable, we show that under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions it does not have a polynomial-size problem kernel when parameterized by the number of vertex deletions. Nevertheless, we develop several effective data reduction and pruning rules, resulting in a competitive solver, clearly outperforming a standard CPLEX solver in most instances of an established biological test data set."

Here, we investigate in detail which conditions affect the performance of this type of grounded language learning model. We show that multilingual training improves over bilingual training, and that low-resource languages benefit from training with higher-resource languages. We demonstrate that a multilingual model can be trained equally well on either translations or comparable sentence pairs, and that annotating the same set of images in multiple language enables further improvements via an additional caption-caption ranking objective."

However, recent research has highlighted severe limitations of these models in their ability to perform compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and relations. Scene graphs have emerged as an effective way to understand images compositionally. These are graph-structured semantic representations of images that contain objects, their attributes, and relations with other objects in a scene. In this work, we consider the scene graph parsed from text as a proxy for the image scene graph and propose a graph decomposition and augmentation framework along with a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning objective between images and text that aligns sentences of various complexities to the same image. Along with this, we propose novel negative mining techniques in the scene graph space for improving attribute binding and relation understanding. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach that significantly improves attribute binding, relation understanding, systematic generalization, and productivity on multiple recently proposed benchmarks (For example, improvements upto $18\%$ for systematic generalization, $16.5\%$ for relation understanding over a strong baseline), while achieving similar or better performance than CLIP on various general multimodal tasks."

Taking advantages of both octree based methods and voxel based schemes, our approach employs the voxel context to compress the octree structured data. Specifically, we first extract the local voxel representation that encodes the spatial neighbouring context information for each node in the constructed octree. Then, in the entropy coding stage, we propose a voxel context based deep entropy model to compress the symbols of non-leaf nodes in a lossless way. Furthermore, for dynamic point cloud compression, we additionally introduce the local voxel representations from the temporal neighbouring point clouds to exploit temporal dependency. More importantly, to alleviate the distortion from the octree construction procedure, we propose a voxel context based 3D coordinate refinement method to produce more accurate reconstructed point cloud at the decoder side, which is applicable to both static and dynamic point cloud compression. The comprehensive experiments on both static and dynamic point cloud benchmark datasets(e.g., ScanNet and Semantic KITTI) clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed method VoxelContext-Net for 3D point cloud geometry compression."

Due to the absence of large generalized underwater depth datasets and the difficulty in obtaining ground truth depth-maps, supervised learning techniques such as direct depth regression cannot be used. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for depth estimation from a single underwater image taken `in the wild' by using haze as a cue for depth. Our approach is based on indirect depth-map estimation where we learn the mapping functions between unpaired RGB-D terrestrial images and arbitrary underwater images to estimate the required depth-map. We propose a method which is based on the principles of cycle-consistent learning and uses dense-block based auto-encoders as generator networks. We evaluate and compare our method both quantitatively and qualitatively on various underwater images with diverse attenuation and scattering conditions and show that our method produces state-of-the-art results for unsupervised depth estimation from a single underwater image."

450,aaai,2022,Reinforcement Learning Based Dynamic Model Combination for Time Series Forecasting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20618,"We introduce a framework to dynamically combine heterogeneous models called \texttt{DYCHEM}, which forecasts a set of time series that are related through an aggregation hierarchy. Different types of forecasting models can be employed as individual ``experts'' so that each model is tailored to the nature of the corresponding time series. \texttt{DYCHEM} learns hierarchical structures during the training stage to help generalize better across all the time series being modeled and also mitigates coherency issues that arise due to constraints imposed by the hierarchy. To improve the reliability of forecasts, we construct quantile estimations based on the point forecasts obtained from combined heterogeneous models. The resulting quantile forecasts are coherent and independent of the choice of forecasting models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both point and quantile forecasts for hierarchical time series (HTS), including public data and user records from a large financial software company. In general, our method is robust, adaptive to datasets with different properties, and highly configurable and efficient for large-scale forecasting pipelines."

Can machines learn to emulate this laborious process? We present a novel task and approach for document-to-slide generation. Solving this involves document summarization, image and text retrieval, slide structure and layout prediction to arrange key elements in a form suitable for presentation. We propose a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence approach to tackle our task in an end-to-end manner. Our approach exploits the inherent structures within documents and slides and incorporates paraphrasing and layout prediction modules to generate slides. To help accelerate research in this domain, we release a dataset about 6K paired documents and slide decks used in our experiments. We show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and produces slides with rich content and aligned imagery."

In algorithmic Bayesian persuasion, we are interested in efficiently designing the sender's signaling schemes that lead the receiver to take action in favor of the sender. This paper studies algorithmic Bayesian-persuasion settings where the receiver's feasible actions are specified by combinatorial constraints, e.g., matroids or paths in graphs. We first show that constant-factor approximation is NP-hard even in some special cases of matroids or paths. We then propose a polynomial-time algorithm for general matroids by assuming the number of states of nature to be a constant. We finally consider a relaxed notion of persuasiveness, called CCE-persuasiveness, and present a sufficient condition for polynomial-time approximability."

Unlike traditional networks, implicit networks solve a fixed point equation to compute inferences. Solving for the fixed point varies in complexity, depending on provided data and an error tolerance. Importantly, implicit networks may be trained with fixed memory costs in stark contrast to feedforward networks, whose memory requirements scale linearly with depth. However, there is no free lunch -- backpropagation through implicit networks often requires solving a costly Jacobian-based equation arising from the implicit function theorem. We propose Jacobian-Free Backpropagation (JFB), a fixed-memory approach that circumvents the need to solve Jacobian-based equations. JFB makes implicit networks faster to train and significantly easier to implement, without sacrificing test accuracy. Our experiments show implicit networks trained with JFB are competitive with feedforward networks and prior implicit networks given the same number of parameters."

Temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms use bootstrapping, i.e. they update the value function toward a learning target using value estimates at subsequent time-steps. Alternatively, the value function can be updated toward a learning target constructed by separately predicting successor features (SF)--a policy-dependent model--and linearly combining them with instantaneous rewards. We focus on bootstrapping targets used when estimating value functions, and propose a new backup target, the $\eta$-return mixture, which implicitly combines value-predictive knowledge (used by TD methods) with (successor) feature-predictive knowledge--with a parameter $\eta$ capturing how much to rely on each. We illustrate that incorporating predictive knowledge through an $\eta\gamma$-discounted SF model makes more efficient use of sampled experience, compared to either extreme, i.e. bootstrapping entirely on the value function estimate, or bootstrapping on the product of separately estimated successor features and instantaneous reward models. We empirically show this approach leads to faster policy evaluation and better control performance, for tabular and nonlinear function approximations, indicating scalability and generality."

Built upon GPflow and RDKit, FlowMO enables the user to make predictions with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, an output central to active learning and molecular design applications. Gaussian Processes are particularly attractive for modelling small molecular datasets, a characteristic of many real-world virtual screening campaigns where high-quality experimental data is scarce. Computational experiments across three small datasets demonstrate comparable predictive performance to deep learning methods but with superior uncertainty calibration."

The vertex set of $S(G,a,b)$ is the set of all shortest paths between $a$ and $b$ in $G$. Two vertices in $V(S(G,a,b))$ are adjacent, if their corresponding paths in $G$ differ by exactly one vertex. This paper examines the properties of shortest path graphs. Results include establishing classes of graphs that appear as shortest path graphs, decompositions and sums involving shortest path graphs, and the complete classification of shortest path graphs with girth $5$ or greater. We also show that the shortest path graph of a grid graph is an induced subgraph of a lattice."
457,aaai,2022,Playing Lottery Tickets with Vision and Language,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19945,"The lottery ticket hypothesis proposes that over-parameterization of deep neural networks (DNNs) aids training by increasing the probability of a ""lucky"" sub-network initialization being present rather than by helping the optimization process (Frankle & Carbin, 2019). Intriguingly, this phenomenon suggests that initialization strategies for DNNs can be improved substantially, but the lottery ticket hypothesis has only previously been tested in the context of supervised learning for natural image tasks. Here, we evaluate whether ""winning ticket"" initializations exist in two different domains: natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL).For NLP, we examined both recurrent LSTM models and large-scale Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017). For RL, we analyzed a number of discrete-action space tasks, including both classic control and pixel control. Consistent with workin supervised image classification, we confirm that winning ticket initializations generally outperform parameter-matched random initializations, even at extreme pruning rates for both NLP and RL. Notably, we are able to find winning ticket initializations for Transformers which enable models one-third the size to achieve nearly equivalent performance. Together, these results suggest that the lottery ticket hypothesis is not restricted to supervised learning of natural images, but rather represents a broader phenomenon in DNNs."
458,aaai,2022,Bayesian Persuasion in Sequential Decision-Making,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20434,"We study an information-structure design problem (a.k.a. persuasion) with a single sender and multiple receivers with actions of a priori unknown types, independently drawn from action-specific marginal distributions. As in the standard Bayesian persuasion model, the sender has access to additional information regarding the action types, which she can exploit when committing to a (noisy) signaling scheme through which she sends a private signal to each receiver. The novelty of our model is in considering the case where the receivers interact in a sequential game with imperfect information, with utilities depending on the game outcome and the realized action types. After formalizing the notions of ex ante and ex interim persuasiveness (which differ in the time at which the receivers commit to following the sender's signaling scheme), we investigate the continuous optimization problem of computing a signaling scheme which maximizes the sender's expected revenue. We show that computing an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme is NP-hard when there are three or more receivers. In contrast with previous hardness results for ex interim persuasion, we show that, for games with two receivers, an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time thanks to a novel algorithm based on the ellipsoid method which we propose."

Unfortunately, the method tends to be unstable in the case of function approximation. In this paper, we propose a simple variant of AL, named smoothing advantage learning (SAL), to alleviate this problem. The key to our method is to replace the original Bellman Optimal operator in AL with a smooth one so as to obtain more reliable estimation of the temporal difference target. We give a detailed account of the resulting action gap and the performance bound for approximate SAL. Further theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed value smoothing technique not only helps to stabilize the training procedure of AL by controlling the trade-off between convergence rate and the upper bound of the approximation errors, but is beneficial to increase the action gap between the optimal and sub-optimal action value as well."
460,aaai,2022,NAREOR: The Narrative Reordering Problem,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21309,"Many implicit inferences exist in text depending on how it is structured that can critically impact the text's interpretation and meaning. One such structural aspect present in text with chronology is the order of its presentation. For narratives or stories, this is known as the narrative order. Reordering a narrative can impact the temporal, causal, event-based, and other inferences readers draw from it, which in turn can have strong effects both on its interpretation and interestingness. In this paper, we propose and investigate the task of Narrative Reordering (NAREOR) which involves rewriting a given story in a different narrative order while preserving its plot. We present a dataset, NAREORC, with human rewritings of stories within ROCStories in non-linear orders, and conduct a detailed analysis of it. Further, we propose novel task-specific training methods with suitable evaluation metrics. We perform experiments on NAREORC using state-of-the-art models such as BART and T5 and conduct extensive automatic and human evaluations. We demonstrate that although our models can perform decently, NAREOR is a challenging task with potential for further exploration. We also investigate two applications of NAREOR: generation of more interesting variations of stories and serving as adversarial sets for temporal/event-related tasks, besides discussing other prospective ones, such as for pedagogical setups related to language skills like essay writing and applications to medicine involving clinical narratives."

Previous works mainly targeted the case with two diversity classes (represented as colors in the model) and provided some initial complexity-theoretic and existential results concerning Nash and individually stable outcomes. Here, we design new algorithms accompanied with lower bounds which provide a complete parameterized-complexity picture for computing Nash and individually stable outcomes with respect to the most natural parameterizations of the problem. Crucially, our results hold for general Hedonic diversity games where the number of colors is not necessarily restricted to two, and show that -- apart from two trivial cases -- a necessary condition for tractability in this setting is that the number of colors is bounded by the parameter. Moreover, for the special case of two colors we resolve an open question asked in previous work (Boehmer and Elkind, AAAI 2020)."

In this paper, we corroborate based on three subjective experiments on a novel image dataset that objects in natural images are inherently perceived to have varying levels of importance. Our dataset, named SalMoN (saliency in multi-object natural images), has 588 images containing multiple objects. The subjective experiments performed record spontaneous attention and perception through eye fixation duration, point clicking and rectangle drawing. As object saliency in a multi-object image is inherently multi-level, we propose that salient object detection must be evaluated for the capability to detect all multi-level salient objects apart from the salient object class detection capability. For this purpose, we generate multi-level maps as ground truth corresponding to all the dataset images using the results of the subjective experiments, with the labels being multi-level salient objects and background. We then propose the use of mean absolute error, Kendall's rank correlation and average area under precision-recall curve to evaluate existing salient object detection methods on our multi-level saliency ground truth dataset. Approaches that represent saliency detection on images as local-global hierarchical processing of a graph perform well in our dataset."

Existing counterfactual explainable approaches face huge search space and their explanations are either action-based (e.g., user click) or aspect-based (i.e., item description). We believe item attribute-based explanations are more intuitive and persuadable for users since they explain by fine-grained item demographic features (e.g., brand). Moreover, counterfactual explanation could enhance recommendations by filtering out negative items.   In this work, we propose a novel Counterfactual Explainable Recommendation (CERec) to generate item attribute-based counterfactual explanations meanwhile to boost recommendation performance. Our CERec optimizes an explanation policy upon uniformly searching candidate counterfactuals within a reinforcement learning environment. We reduce the huge search space with an adaptive path sampler by using rich context information of a given knowledge graph. We also deploy the explanation policy to a recommendation model to enhance the recommendation. Extensive explainability and recommendation evaluations demonstrate CERec's ability to provide explanations consistent with user preferences and maintain improved recommendations.

However, it is difficult to apply these methods to real-world scenarios due to the computational and memory cost. Meanwhile, how to take full advantage of the intermediate features under the constraints of limited parameters and calculations is also a huge challenge. To alleviate these issues, we propose a lightweight yet efficient Feature Distillation Interaction Weighted Network (FDIWN). Specifically, FDIWN utilizes a series of specially designed Feature Shuffle Weighted Groups (FSWG) as the backbone, and several novel mutual Wide-residual Distillation Interaction Blocks (WDIB) form an FSWG. In addition, Wide Identical Residual Weighting (WIRW) units and Wide Convolutional Residual Weighting (WCRW) units are introduced into WDIB for better feature distillation. Moreover, a Wide-Residual Distillation Connection (WRDC) framework and a Self-Calibration Fusion (SCF) unit are proposed to interact features with different scales more flexibly and efficiently.Extensive experiments show that our FDIWN is superior to other models to strike a good balance between model performance and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/IVIPLab/FDIWN."

The model couples the following two components: (1) the vector representations of local contents of images and (2) the matrix representations of local pixel displacements caused by the relative motions between the agent and the objects in the 3D scene. When the image frame undergoes changes due to local pixel displacements, the vectors are multiplied by the matrices that represent the local displacements. Thus the vector representation is equivariant as it varies according to the local displacements. Our experiments show that our model can learn Gabor-like filter pairs of quadrature phases. The profiles of the learned filters match those of simple cells in Macaque V1. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model can learn to infer local motions in either a supervised or unsupervised manner. With such a simple model, we achieve competitive results on optical flow estimation."

However, the conventional paradigm constructs the backbone by purely stacking the manually designed global self-attention layers, introducing inductive bias and thus leads to sub-optimal. In this work, we make the first attempt to automatically discover novel pre-trained language model (PLM) backbone on a flexible search space containing the most fundamental operations from scratch. Specifically, we propose a well-designed search space which (i) contains primitive math operations in the intra-layer level to explore novel attention structures, and (ii) leverages convolution blocks to be the supplementary for attentions in the inter-layer level to better learn local dependency. To enhance the efficiency for finding promising architectures, we propose an Operation-Priority Neural Architecture Search (OP-NAS) algorithm, which optimizes both the search algorithm and evaluation of candidate models. Specifically, we propose Operation-Priority (OP) evolution strategy to facilitate model search via balancing exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, we design a Bi-branch Weight-Sharing (BIWS) training strategy for fast model evaluation. Extensive experiments show that the searched architecture (named AutoBERT-Zero) significantly outperforms BERT and its variants of different model capacities in various downstream tasks, proving the architecture's transfer and scaling abilities. Remarkably, AutoBERT-Zero-base outperforms RoBERTa-base (using much more data) and BERT-large (with much larger model size) by 2.4 and 1.4 higher score on GLUE test set."

The problem is both fundamental and interesting, as most machine-generated captions, despite phenomenal research progresses in the past several years, are expressed in a very monotonic and featureless format. While such captions are normally accurate, they often lack important characteristics in human languages - distinctiveness for each caption and diversity for different images. To address this problem, we propose a novel conditional generative adversarial network for generating diverse captions across images. Instead of estimating the quality of a caption solely on one image, the proposed comparative adversarial learning framework better assesses the quality of captions by comparing a set of captions within the image-caption joint space. By contrasting with human-written captions and image-mismatched captions, the caption generator effectively exploits the inherent characteristics of human languages, and generates more discriminative captions. We show that our proposed network is capable of producing accurate and diverse captions across images."

Various authoring tools have been proposed to facilitate the creation of infographics. However, creating a professional infographic with these authoring tools is still not an easy task, requiring much time and design expertise. Therefore, these tools are generally not attractive to casual users, who are either unwilling to take time to learn the tools or lacking in proper design expertise to create a professional infographic. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach: to automatically generate infographics from natural language statements. We first conducted a preliminary study to explore the design space of infographics. Based on the preliminary study, we built a proof-of-concept system that automatically converts statements about simple proportion-related statistics to a set of infographics with pre-designed styles. Finally, we demonstrated the usability and usefulness of the system through sample results, exhibits, and expert reviews."

However, it is difficult to understand emotions conveyed in such videos due to the complex and unstructured nature of user-generated content and the sparsity of video frames expressing emotion. In this paper, for the first time, we study the problem of transferring knowledge from heterogeneous external sources, including image and textual data, to facilitate three related tasks in understanding video emotion: emotion recognition, emotion attribution and emotion-oriented summarization. Specifically, our framework (1) learns a video encoding from an auxiliary emotional image dataset in order to improve supervised video emotion recognition, and (2) transfers knowledge from an auxiliary textual corpora for zero-shot recognition of emotion classes unseen during training. The proposed technique for knowledge transfer facilitates novel applications of emotion attribution and emotion-oriented summarization. A comprehensive set of experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."

We consider the popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) with the efficiency notion of Pareto-optimality (PO). While it is known that an EF1+PO allocation exists and can be computed in pseudo-polynomial time in the case of goods, the same problem is open for chores.   Our first result is a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for computing an EF1+PO allocation for bivalued instances, where agents have (at most) two disutility values for the chores. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial class of indivisible chores to admit an EF1+PO allocation and an efficient algorithm for its computation.   We also study the problem of computing an envy-free (EF) and PO allocation for the case of divisible chores. While the existence of an EF+PO allocation is known via competitive equilibrium with equal incomes, its efficient computation is open. Our second result shows that for bivalued instances, an EF+PO allocation can be computed in strongly polynomial-time."

As NAS can learn deep network structures automatically, we introduce the NAS conception into the well-known x-vector network. Furthermore, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm enhanced neural architecture search method called Auto-Vector to automatically discover promising networks for the speaker verification task. The experimental results demonstrate our NAS-based model outperforms state-of-the-art speaker verification models."
472,aaai,2022,Faster Algorithms for Weak Backdoors,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20288,"Backdoor attack has emerged as a major security threat to deep neural networks (DNNs). While existing defense methods have demonstrated promising results on detecting or erasing backdoors, it is still not clear whether robust training methods can be devised to prevent the backdoor triggers being injected into the trained model in the first place. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \emph{anti-backdoor learning}, aiming to train \emph{clean} models given backdoor-poisoned data. We frame the overall learning process as a dual-task of learning the \emph{clean} and the \emph{backdoor} portions of data. From this view, we identify two inherent characteristics of backdoor attacks as their weaknesses: 1) the models learn backdoored data much faster than learning with clean data, and the stronger the attack the faster the model converges on backdoored data; 2) the backdoor task is tied to a specific class (the backdoor target class). Based on these two weaknesses, we propose a general learning scheme, Anti-Backdoor Learning (ABL), to automatically prevent backdoor attacks during training. ABL introduces a two-stage \emph{gradient ascent} mechanism for standard training to 1) help isolate backdoor examples at an early training stage, and 2) break the correlation between backdoor examples and the target class at a later training stage. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets against 10 state-of-the-art attacks, we empirically show that ABL-trained models on backdoor-poisoned data achieve the same performance as they were trained on purely clean data. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/bboylyg/ABL}."

XAI is crucial to help satisfying the increasingly important demand of \emph{trustworthy} Artificial Intelligence, characterized by fundamental characteristics such as respect of human autonomy, prevention of harm, transparency, accountability, etc. Within XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations aim to provide to end users a set of features (and their corresponding values) that need to be changed in order to achieve a desired outcome. Current approaches rarely take into account the feasibility of actions needed to achieve the proposed explanations, and in particular they fall short of considering the causal impact of such actions. In this paper, we present Counterfactual Explanations as Interventions in Latent Space (CEILS), a methodology to generate counterfactual explanations capturing by design the underlying causal relations from the data, and at the same time to provide feasible recommendations to reach the proposed profile. Moreover, our methodology has the advantage that it can be set on top of existing counterfactuals generator algorithms, thus minimising the complexity of imposing additional causal constrains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a set of different experiments using synthetic and real datasets (including a proprietary dataset of the financial domain)."
474,aaai,2022,ISEEQ: Information Seeking Question Generation Using Dynamic Meta-Information Retrieval and Knowledge Graphs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21312,"Conversational Information Seeking (CIS) is a relatively new research area within conversational AI that attempts to seek information from end-users in order to understand and satisfy users' needs. If realized, such a system has far-reaching benefits in the real world; for example, a CIS system can assist clinicians in pre-screening or triaging patients in healthcare. A key open sub-problem in CIS that remains unaddressed in the literature is generating Information Seeking Questions (ISQs) based on a short initial query from the end-user. To address this open problem, we propose Information SEEking Question generator (ISEEQ), a novel approach for generating ISQs from just a short user query, given a large text corpus relevant to the user query. Firstly, ISEEQ uses a knowledge graph to enrich the user query. Secondly, ISEEQ uses the knowledge-enriched query to retrieve relevant context passages to ask coherent ISQs adhering to a conceptual flow. Thirdly, ISEEQ introduces a new deep generative-adversarial reinforcement learning-based approach for generating ISQs. We show that ISEEQ can generate high-quality ISQs to promote the development of CIS agents. ISEEQ significantly outperforms comparable baselines on five ISQ evaluation metrics across four datasets having user queries from diverse domains. Further, we argue that ISEEQ is transferable across domains for generating ISQs, as it shows the acceptable performance when trained and tested on different pairs of domains. The qualitative human evaluation confirms ISEEQ-generated ISQs are comparable in quality to human-generated questions and outperform the best comparable baseline."

However, a key challenge for LReID is how to incrementally preserve old knowledge and gradually add new capabilities to the system. Unlike most existing LReID methods, which mainly focus on dealing with catastrophic forgetting, our focus is on a more challenging problem, which is, not only trying to reduce the forgetting on old tasks but also aiming to improve the model performance on both new and old tasks during the lifelong learning process. Inspired by the biological process of human cognition where the somatosensory neocortex and the hippocampus work together in memory consolidation, we formulated a model called Knowledge Refreshing and Consolidation (KRC) that achieves both positive forward and backward transfer. More specifically, a knowledge refreshing scheme is incorporated with the knowledge rehearsal mechanism to enable bi-directional knowledge transfer by introducing a dynamic memory model and an adaptive working model. Moreover, a knowledge consolidation scheme operating on the dual space further improves model stability over the long term. Extensive evaluations show KRC's superiority over the state-of-the-art LReID methods on challenging pedestrian benchmarks."

477,aaai,2022,Target Languages (vs. Inductive Biases) for Learning to Act and Plan,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21497,"Recent breakthroughs in AI have shown the remarkable power of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. These developments, however, have been tied to specific tasks, and progress in out-of-distribution generalization has been limited. While it is assumed that these limitations can be overcome by incorporating suitable inductive biases, the notion of inductive biases itself is often left vague and does not provide meaningful guidance. In the paper, I articulate a different learning approach where representations do not emerge from biases in a neural architecture but are learned over a given target language with a known semantics. The basic ideas are implicit in mainstream AI where representations have been encoded in languages ranging from fragments of first-order logic to probabilistic structural causal models. The challenge is to learn from data the representations that have traditionally been crafted by hand. Generalization is then a result of the semantics of the language. The goals of this paper are to make these ideas explicit, to place them in a broader context where the design of the target language is crucial, and to illustrate them in the context of learning to act and plan. For this, after a general discussion, I consider learning representations of actions, general policies, and subgoals (""intrinsic rewards""). In these cases, learning is formulated as a combinatorial problem but nothing prevents the use of deep learning techniques instead. Indeed, learning representations over languages with a known semantics provides an account of what is to be learned, while learning representations with neural nets provides a complementary account of how representations can be learned. The challenge and the opportunity is to bring the two together."

Alternating gradient descent obtains this convergence guarantee while using fixed learning rates that are four times larger than the optimistic variant of gradient descent.

A study of human reasoning under uncertainty suggests two different strategies for explaining probabilistic reasoning: The first, qualitative belief propagation, traces the qualitative effect of evidence through a belief network from one variable to the next. This propagation algorithm is an alternative to the graph reduction algorithms of Wellman (1988) for inference in qualitative probabilistic networks. It is based on a qualitative analysis of intercausal reasoning, which is a generalization of Pearl's ""explaining away"", and an alternative to Wellman's definition of qualitative synergy. The other, Scenario-based reasoning, involves the generation of alternative causal ""stories"" accounting for the evidence. Comparing a few of the most probable scenarios provides an approximate way to explain the results of probabilistic reasoning. Both schemes employ causal as well as probabilistic knowledge. Probabilities may be presented as phrases and/or numbers. Users can control the style, abstraction and completeness of explanations."

These devices are used to develop truly distributed IoT-based mechanisms where machine learning (ML) models are utilized. However, integrating ML models to edge devices requires an understanding of various software tools such as programming languages and domain-specific knowledge. Anomaly detection is one of the domains where a high level of expertise is required to achieve promising results. In this work, we present AnoML which is an end-to-end data science pipeline that allows the integration of multiple wireless communication protocols, anomaly detection algorithms, deployment to the edge, fog, and cloud platforms with minimal user interaction. We facilitate the development of IoT anomaly detection mechanisms by reducing the barriers that are formed due to the heterogeneity of an IoT environment. The proposed pipeline supports four main phases: (i) data ingestion, (ii) model training, (iii) model deployment, (iv) inference and maintaining. We evaluate the pipeline with two anomaly detection datasets while comparing the efficiency of several machine learning algorithms within different nodes. We also provide the source code (https://gitlab.com/IOTGarage/anoml-iot-analytics) of the developed tools which are the main components of the pipeline."
481,aaai,2022,Recovering the Propensity Score from Biased Positive Unlabeled Data,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20624,"A straightforward application of semi-supervised machine learning to the problem of treatment effect estimation would be to consider data as ""unlabeled"" if treatment assignment and covariates are observed but outcomes are unobserved. According to this formulation, large unlabeled data sets could be used to estimate a high dimensional propensity function and causal inference using a much smaller labeled data set could proceed via weighted estimators using the learned propensity scores. In the limiting case of infinite unlabeled data, one may estimate the high dimensional propensity function exactly. However, longstanding advice in the causal inference community suggests that estimated propensity scores (from labeled data alone) are actually preferable to true propensity scores, implying that the unlabeled data is actually useless in this context. In this paper we examine this paradox and propose a simple procedure that reconciles the strong intuition that a known propensity functions should be useful for estimating treatment effects with the previous literature suggesting otherwise. Further, simulation studies suggest that direct regression may be preferable to inverse-propensity weight estimators in many circumstances."

In this work we introduce the first ever framework to generate novel visual illusions with an artificial neural network (ANN). It takes the form of a generative adversarial network, with a generator of visual illusion candidates and two discriminator modules, one for the inducer background and another that decides whether or not the candidate is indeed an illusion. The generality of the model is exemplified by synthesizing illusions of different types, and validated with psychophysical experiments that corroborate that the outputs of our ANN are indeed visual illusions to human observers. Apart from synthesizing new visual illusions, which may help vision researchers, the proposed model has the potential to open new ways to study the similarities and differences between ANN and human visual perception."

Fairness in ML centers on detecting bias towards certain demographic populations induced by an ML classifier and proposes algorithmic solutions to mitigate the bias with respect to different fairness definitions. To this end, several fairness verifiers have been proposed that compute the bias in the prediction of an ML classifier--essentially beyond a finite dataset--given the probability distribution of input features. In the context of verifying linear classifiers, existing fairness verifiers are limited by accuracy due to imprecise modeling of correlations among features and scalability due to restrictive formulations of the classifiers as SSAT/SMT formulas or by sampling.   In this paper, we propose an efficient fairness verifier, called FVGM, that encodes the correlations among features as a Bayesian network. In contrast to existing verifiers, FVGM proposes a stochastic subset-sum based approach for verifying linear classifiers. Experimentally, we show that FVGM leads to an accurate and scalable assessment for more diverse families of fairness-enhancing algorithms, fairness attacks, and group/causal fairness metrics than the state-of-the-art fairness verifiers. We also demonstrate that FVGM facilitates the computation of fairness influence functions as a stepping stone to detect the source of bias induced by subsets of features."

While community knowledge is valuable, forest officials and conservation organisations can greatly benefit from predictive analysis of human-wildlife conflict, leading to targeted interventions that can potentially help save lives and livelihoods. However, the problem of prediction is a complex socio-technical problem in the context of limited data in low-resource regions.   Identifying the ""right"" features to make accurate predictions of conflicts at the required spatial granularity using a sparse conflict training dataset} is the key challenge that we address in this paper. Specifically, we do an illustrative case study on human-wildlife conflicts in the Bramhapuri Forest Division in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, India. Most existing work has considered human-wildlife conflicts in protected areas and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort at prediction of human-wildlife conflicts in unprotected areas and using those predictions for deploying interventions on the ground."

Recently, in order to explicitly consider this subjectivity, the annotation of music items was modeled as a translation task: predict for a music item its music genres within a target vocabulary or taxonomy (tag system) from a set of music genre tags originating from other tag systems. However, without a parallel corpus, previous solutions could not handle tag systems in other languages, being limited to the English-language only. Here, by learning multilingual music genre embeddings, we enable cross-lingual music genre translation without relying on a parallel corpus. First, we apply compositionality functions on pre-trained word embeddings to represent multi-word tags.Second, we adapt the tag representations to the music domain by leveraging multilingual music genres graphs with a modified retrofitting algorithm. Experiments show that our method: 1) is effective in translating music genres across tag systems in multiple languages (English, French and Spanish); 2) outperforms the previous baseline in an English-language multi-source translation task. We publicly release the new multilingual data and code."

Learning the DAG is an NP-hard problem and exact learning algorithms are feasible only for small sets of variables. We propose two scalable heuristics for learning DAGs in the linear structural equation case.

Thanks to this decoupling, our methods scale up beyond thousands of variables."
487,aaai,2022,Deep Confidence Guided Distance for 3D Partial Shape Registration,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19951,"We present a novel non-iterative learnable method for partial-to-partial 3D shape registration. The partial alignment task is extremely complex, as it jointly tries to match between points and identify which points do not appear in the corresponding shape, causing the solution to be non-unique and ill-posed in most cases.   Until now, two principal methodologies have been suggested to solve this problem: sample a subset of points that are likely to have correspondences or perform soft alignment between the point clouds and try to avoid a match to an occluded part. These heuristics work when the partiality is mild or when the transformation is small but fails for severe occlusions or when outliers are present. We present a unique approach named Confidence Guided Distance Network (CGD-net), where we fuse learnable similarity between point embeddings and spatial distance between point clouds, inducing an optimized solution for the overlapping points while ignoring parts that only appear in one of the shapes. The point feature generation is done by a self-supervised architecture that repels far points to have different embeddings, therefore succeeds to align partial views of shapes, even with excessive internal symmetries or acute rotations. We compare our network to recently presented learning-based and axiomatic methods and report a fundamental boost in performance."
488,aaai,2022,An Algorithmic Theory of Markets and Their Application to Decentralized Markets,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21576,"Electricity markets differ in their ability to meet power imbalances in short notice in a controlled fashion. Relatively flexible markets have the ability to ramp up (or down) power flows across interties without compromising their ability to reliably meet internal demand. In this paper, a market mechanism to enable flexibility trading amongst market operators is introduced. In the proposed market mechanism, market operators exchange information regarding optimal terms of trade (nodal prices and flows) along interconnection lines at every trading round. Equipped with this information, each market operator then independently solves its own internal chance-constrained economic dispatch problem and broadcasts the updated optimal terms of trade for flows across markets. We show the proposed decentralized market mechanism for flexibility trading converges to a Nash equilibrium of the intraday market coupling game, i.e. a combination of internal market clearing solutions (one for each participating market) and flows and prices along interconnection lines so that no individual market operator has an incentive to modify its own internal solution and/or the terms of trade along interties. For a specific class of chance constraints, we show that the limiting equilibrium outcome is efficient, i.e. it corresponds to the solution of the single market clearing problem for all participating markets. The proposed market mechanism is illustrated with an application to the three-area IEEE Reliability Test System."

However, forcing an answer to be a single span can be restrictive, and some recent datasets also include multi-span questions, i.e., questions whose answer is a set of non-contiguous spans in the text. Naturally, models that return single spans cannot answer these questions. In this work, we propose a simple architecture for answering multi-span questions by casting the task as a sequence tagging problem, namely, predicting for each input token whether it should be part of the output or not. Our model substantially improves performance on span extraction questions from DROP and Quoref by 9.9 and 5.5 EM points respectively."

Understanding modal regression's theoretical behavior can be fundamental in learning theory. Despite significant progress in characterizing its statistical property, the majority of the results are based on the assumption that samples are independent and identical distributed (i.i.d.), which is too restrictive for real-world applications. This paper concerns the statistical property of regularized modal regression (RMR) within an important dependence structure - Markov dependent. Specifically, we establish the upper bound for RMR estimator under moderate conditions and give an explicit learning rate. Our results show that the Markov dependence impacts on the generalization error in the way that sample size would be discounted by a multiplicative factor depending on the spectral gap of underlying Markov chain. This result shed a new light on characterizing the theoretical underpinning for robust regression."

Nonetheless, they are controversial for over-confident predictions. In some scenarios, users do not only care about the accuracy but also the confidence of model. Unfortunately, mainstream neural networks are poorly calibrated, with a large gap between accuracy and confidence. To handle this problem defined as confidence calibration, we propose a model using the hyperspherical space and rebalanced accuracy-uncertainty loss. Specifically, we project the label vector onto hyperspherical space uniformly to generate a dense label representation matrix, which mitigates over-confident predictions due to overfitting sparce one-hot label matrix. Besides, we rebalance samples of different accuracy and uncertainty to better guide model training. Experiments on the open datasets verify that our model outperforms the existing calibration methods and achieves a significant improvement on the calibration metric."

This is particularly relevant for clinical applications since patient data are usually not allowed to be transferred out of medical facilities, leading to the need for FL. Existing FL methods typically share model parameters or employ co-distillation to address the issue of unbalanced data distribution. However, they also require numerous rounds of synchronized communication and, more importantly, suffer from a privacy leakage risk. We propose a privacy-preserving FL framework leveraging unlabeled public data for one-way offline knowledge distillation in this work. The central model is learned from local knowledge via ensemble attention distillation. Our technique uses decentralized and heterogeneous local data like existing FL approaches, but more importantly, it significantly reduces the risk of privacy leakage. We demonstrate that our method achieves very competitive performance with more robust privacy preservation based on extensive experiments on image classification, segmentation, and reconstruction tasks."

We determine the minimax learning rates for distributions on a smooth manifold, in a cost-sensitive setting. This generalises a classic result of Audibert and Tsybakov. Building upon recent work of Chaudhuri and Dasgupta we prove that these minimax rates are attained by the approximate nearest neighbour algorithm, where neighbours are computed in a randomly projected low-dimensional space. In addition, we give a bound on the number of dimensions required for the projection which depends solely upon the reach and dimension of the manifold, combined with the regularity of the marginal."

They are popular for their simple principles and strong performance on unstructured, feature-based data that is commonplace in many practical applications. However, they cannot learn to adapt for a particular set of data due to their lack of trainable parameters. In this paper, we begin by unifying local outlier methods by showing that they are particular cases of the more general message passing framework used in graph neural networks. This allows us to introduce learnability into local outlier methods, in the form of a neural network, for greater flexibility and expressivity: specifically, we propose LUNAR, a novel, graph neural network-based anomaly detection method. LUNAR learns to use information from the nearest neighbours of each node in a trainable way to find anomalies. We show that our method performs significantly better than existing local outlier methods, as well as state-of-the-art deep baselines. We also show that the performance of our method is much more robust to different settings of the local neighbourhood size."

Dense pointcloud data require a computationally expensive feature encoding process before semantic segmentation. Previous work has used different approaches to drastically downsample from the original pointcloud so common computing hardware can be utilized. While these approaches can relieve the computation burden to some extent, they are still limited in their processing capability for multiple scans. We present MuGNet, a memory-efficient, end-to-end graph neural network framework to perform semantic segmentation on large-scale pointclouds. We reduce the computation demand by utilizing a graph neural network on the preformed pointcloud graphs and retain the precision of the segmentation with a bidirectional network that fuses feature embedding at different resolutions. Our framework has been validated on benchmark datasets including Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces Dataset(S3DIS) and Virtual KITTI Dataset. We demonstrate that our framework can process up to 45 room scans at once on a single 11 GB GPU while still surpassing other graph-based solutions for segmentation on S3DIS with an 88.5\% (+3\%) overall accuracy and 69.8\% (+7.7\%) mIOU accuracy."
497,aaai,2022,Sufficient Reasons for Classifier Decisions in the Presence of Domain Constraints,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20507,"Recent work has unveiled a theory for reasoning about the decisions made by binary classifiers: a classifier describes a Boolean function, and the reasons behind an instance being classified as positive are the prime-implicants of the function that are satisfied by the instance. One drawback of these works is that they do not explicitly treat scenarios where the underlying data is known to be constrained, e.g., certain combinations of features may not exist, may not be observable, or may be required to be disregarded. We propose a more general theory, also based on prime-implicants, tailored to taking constraints into account. The main idea is to view classifiers in the presence of constraints as describing partial Boolean functions, i.e., that are undefined on instances that do not satisfy the constraints. We prove that this simple idea results in reasons that are no less (and sometimes more) succinct. That is, not taking constraints into account (e.g., ignored, or taken as negative instances) results in reasons that are subsumed by reasons that do take constraints into account. We illustrate this improved parsimony on synthetic classifiers and classifiers learned from real data."

We study three related online matching problems with the constraint of matching every vertex, i.e., with no rejections. We adopt a model in which vertices arrive in uniformly random order and the non-negative edge-weights are arbitrary. For the capacitated online bipartite matching problem, in which the vertices of one side of the graph are offline and those of the other side arrive online, we give a 4.62-competitive algorithm when the capacity of each offline vertex is 2. For the online general (non-bipartite) matching problem, where all vertices arrive online, we give a 3.34-competitive algorithm. We also study the online roommate matching problem (Huzhang et al. 2017), in which each room (offline vertex) holds 2 persons (online vertices). Persons derive non-negative additive utilities from their room as well as roommate. In this model, with the goal of maximizing the social welfare, we give a 7.96-competitive algorithm. This is an improvement over the 24.72 approximation factor in (Huzhang et al. 2017)."

501,aaai,2022,Predicting Physical World Destinations for Commands Given to Self-Driving Cars,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19952,"In recent years, we have seen significant steps taken in the development of self-driving cars. Multiple companies are starting to roll out impressive systems that work in a variety of settings. These systems can sometimes give the impression that full self-driving is just around the corner and that we would soon build cars without even a steering wheel. The increase in the level of autonomy and control given to an AI provides an opportunity for new modes of human-vehicle interaction. However, surveys have shown that giving more control to an AI in self-driving cars is accompanied by a degree of uneasiness by passengers. In an attempt to alleviate this issue, recent works have taken a natural language-oriented approach by allowing the passenger to give commands that refer to specific objects in the visual scene. Nevertheless, this is only half the task as the car should also understand the physical destination of the command, which is what we focus on in this paper. We propose an extension in which we annotate the 3D destination that the car needs to reach after executing the given command and evaluate multiple different baselines on predicting this destination location. Additionally, we introduce a model that outperforms the prior works adapted for this particular setting."

Our work is motivated by empirical evidence that naive maximization of team reward yields unfair outcomes for individual team members. To address fairness in multi-agent contexts, we introduce team fairness, a group-based fairness measure for multi-agent learning. We then prove that it is possible to enforce team fairness during policy optimization by transforming the team's joint policy into an equivariant map. We refer to our multi-agent learning strategy as Fairness through Equivariance (Fair-E) and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically. We then introduce Fairness through Equivariance Regularization (Fair-ER) as a soft-constraint version of Fair-E and show that it reaches higher levels of utility than Fair-E and fairer outcomes than non-equivariant policies. Finally, we present novel findings regarding the fairness-utility trade-off in multi-agent settings; showing that the magnitude of the trade-off is dependent on agent skill."
503,aaai,2022,SenSE: A Toolkit for Semantic Change Exploration via Word Embedding Alignment,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21717,"Many words have evolved in meaning as a result of cultural and social change. Understanding such changes is crucial for modelling language and cultural evolution. Low-dimensional embedding methods have shown promise in detecting words' meaning change by encoding them into dense vectors. However, when exploring semantic change of words over time, these methods require the alignment of word embeddings across different time periods. This process is computationally expensive, prohibitively time consuming and suffering from contextual variability. In this paper, we propose a new and scalable method for encoding words from different time periods into one dense vector space. This can greatly improve performance when it comes to identifying words that have changed in meaning over time. We evaluated our method on dataset from Google Books N-gram. Our method outperformed three other popular methods in terms of the number of words correctly identified to have changed in meaning. Additionally, we provide an intuitive visualization of the semantic evolution of some words extracted by our method"
504,aaai,2022,Exploiting Fine-Grained Face Forgery Clues via Progressive Enhancement Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19954,"With the rapid development of facial forgery techniques, forgery detection has attracted more and more attention due to security concerns. Existing approaches attempt to use frequency information to mine subtle artifacts under high-quality forged faces. However, the exploitation of frequency information is coarse-grained, and more importantly, their vanilla learning process struggles to extract fine-grained forgery traces. To address this issue, we propose a progressive enhancement learning framework to exploit both the RGB and fine-grained frequency clues. Specifically, we perform a fine-grained decomposition of RGB images to completely decouple the real and fake traces in the frequency space. Subsequently, we propose a progressive enhancement learning framework based on a two-branch network, combined with self-enhancement and mutual-enhancement modules. The self-enhancement module captures the traces in different input spaces based on spatial noise enhancement and channel attention. The Mutual-enhancement module concurrently enhances RGB and frequency features by communicating in the shared spatial dimension. The progressive enhancement process facilitates the learning of discriminative features with fine-grained face forgery clues. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art face forgery detection methods."
505,aaai,2022,Delving into the Local: Dynamic Inconsistency Learning for DeepFake Video Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19955,"Deepfake techniques have been widely used for malicious purposes, prompting extensive research interest in developing Deepfake detection methods. Deepfake manipulations typically involve tampering with facial parts, which can result in inconsistencies across different parts of the face. For instance, Deepfake techniques may change smiling lips to an upset lip, while the eyes remain smiling. Existing detection methods depend on specific indicators of forgery, which tend to disappear as the forgery patterns are improved. To address the limitation, we propose Mover, a new Deepfake detection model that exploits unspecific facial part inconsistencies, which are inevitable weaknesses of Deepfake videos. Mover randomly masks regions of interest (ROIs) and recovers faces to learn unspecific features, which makes it difficult for fake faces to be recovered, while real faces can be easily recovered. Specifically, given a real face image, we first pretrain a masked autoencoder to learn facial part consistency by dividing faces into three parts and randomly masking ROIs, which are then recovered based on the unmasked facial parts. Furthermore, to maximize the discrepancy between real and fake videos, we propose a novel model with dual networks that utilize the pretrained encoder and masked autoencoder, respectively. 1) The pretrained encoder is finetuned for capturing the encoding of inconsistent information in the given video. 2) The pretrained masked autoencoder is utilized for mapping faces and distinguishing real and fake videos. Our extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that Mover is highly effective."

We present a robust topological graph guided approach for line segment detection in low quality binary images (hence, we call it TGGLines). Due to the graph-guided approach, TGGLines not only detects line segments, but also organizes the segments with a line segment connectivity graph, which means the topological relationships (e.g., intersection, an isolated line segment) of the detected line segments are captured and stored; whereas other line detectors only retain a collection of loose line segments. Our empirical results show that the TGGLines detector visually and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art line segment detection methods. In addition, our TGGLines approach has the following two competitive advantages: (1) our method only requires one parameter and it is adaptive, whereas almost all other line segment detection methods require multiple (non-adaptive) parameters, and (2) the line segments detected by TGGLines are organized by a line segment connectivity graph."

Stability is a crucial property for safety-critical dynamical systems, while stabilization of partially observed systems, in many cases, requires controllers to retain and process long-term memories of the past. We consider the important class of recurrent neural networks (RNN) as dynamic controllers for nonlinear uncertain partially-observed systems, and derive convex stability conditions based on integral quadratic constraints, S-lemma and sequential convexification. To ensure stability during the learning and control process, we propose a projected policy gradient method that iteratively enforces the stability conditions in the reparametrized space taking advantage of mild additional information on system dynamics. Numerical experiments show that our method learns stabilizing controllers while using fewer samples and achieving higher final performance compared with policy gradient."
508,aaai,2022,Block-Skim: Efficient Question Answering for Transformer,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21316,"In this paper we propose a novel approach towards improving the efficiency of Question Answering (QA) systems by filtering out questions that will not be answered by them. This is based on an interesting new finding: the answer confidence scores of state-of-the-art QA systems can be approximated well by models solely using the input question text. This enables preemptive filtering of questions that are not answered by the system due to their answer confidence scores being lower than the system threshold. Specifically, we learn Transformer-based question models by distilling Transformer-based answering models. Our experiments on three popular QA datasets and one industrial QA benchmark demonstrate the ability of our question models to approximate the Precision/Recall curves of the target QA system well. These question models, when used as filters, can effectively trade off lower computation cost of QA systems for lower Recall, e.g., reducing computation by ~60%, while only losing ~3-4% of Recall."
509,aaai,2022,Game Design for Better Security of Combination Locks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21547,"When using security questions most users still trade-off security for the convenience of memorability. This happens because most users find strong answers to security questions difficult to remember. Previous research in security education was successful in motivating users to change their behaviour towards security issues, through the use of serious games (i.e. games designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment). Hence, in this paper we evaluate the design of a serious game, to investigate the features and functionalities that users would find desirable in a game that aims to educate them to provide strong and memorable answers to security questions. Our findings reveal that: (1) even for security education games, rewards seem to motivate users to have a better learning experience; (2) functionalities which contain a social element (e.g. getting help from other players) do not seem appropriate for serious games related to security questions, because users fear that their acquaintances could gain access to their security questions; (3) even users who do not usually play games would seem to prefer to play security education games on a mobile device."

Previous Creative AI curricula mainly focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) while paying less attention to Autoregressive Models, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or other generative models, which have since become common in the field of generative AI. VAEs' latent-space structure and interpolation ability could effectively ground the interdisciplinary learning of AI, creative arts, and philosophy. Thus, we designed a lesson to teach high school students about VAEs. We developed a web-based game and used Plato's cave, a philosophical metaphor, to introduce how VAEs work. We used a Google Colab notebook for students to re-train VAEs with their hand-written digits to consolidate their understandings. Finally, we guided the exploration of creative VAE tools such as SketchRNN and MusicVAE to draw the connection between what they learned and real-world applications. This paper describes the lesson design and shares insights from the pilot studies with 22 students. We found that our approach was effective in teaching students about a novel AI concept."

While this problemcan be solved in two separate stages, it is better to directlyminimize the optimization loss. However, this requires dif-ferentiating through a discrete, non-differentiable combina-torial function. Most existing approaches use some form ofsurrogate gradient. Demirovicet alshowed how to directlyexpress the loss of the optimization problem in terms of thepredicted coefficients as a piece-wise linear function. How-ever, their approach is restricted to optimization problemswith a dynamic programming formulation. In this work wepropose a novel divide and conquer algorithm to tackle op-timization problems without this restriction and predict itscoefficients using the optimization loss. We also introduce agreedy version of this approach, which achieves similar re-sults with less computation. We compare our approach withother approaches to the predict+optimize problem and showwe can successfully tackle some hard combinatorial problemsbetter than other predict+optimize methods."

513,aaai,2022,Assessing a Single Image in Reference-Guided Image Synthesis,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19956,"Assessing the performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been an important topic due to its practical significance. Although several evaluation metrics have been proposed, they generally assess the quality of the whole generated image distribution. For Reference-guided Image Synthesis (RIS) tasks, i.e., rendering a source image in the style of another reference image, where assessing the quality of a single generated image is crucial, these metrics are not applicable. In this paper, we propose a general learning-based framework, Reference-guided Image Synthesis Assessment (RISA) to quantitatively evaluate the quality of a single generated image. Notably, the training of RISA does not require human annotations. In specific, the training data for RISA are acquired by the intermediate models from the training procedure in RIS, and weakly annotated by the number of models' iterations, based on the positive correlation between image quality and iterations. As this annotation is too coarse as a supervision signal, we introduce two techniques: 1) a pixel-wise interpolation scheme to refine the coarse labels, and 2) multiple binary classifiers to replace a na\""ive regressor. In addition, an unsupervised contrastive loss is introduced to effectively capture the style similarity between a generated image and its reference image. Empirical results on various datasets demonstrate that RISA is highly consistent with human preference and transfers well across models."

To address this problem, we propose a novel Online Meta-Learning model with Adaption (OMLA). Our proposal is based on two main contributions. First, to reducethe domain-shift between source and target feature distributions we introduce an online feature alignment procedurederived from Batch Normalization. Second, we devise a meta-learning approach that exploits feature alignment forfaster convergence in an online learning setting. Additionally, we propose a meta-pre-training algorithm in order toobtain initial network weights on the source dataset whichfacilitate adaptation on future data streams. Experimentally, we show that both OMLA and meta-pre-training helpthe model to adapt faster to a new environment. Our proposal is evaluated on the wellestablished KITTI dataset,where we show that our online method is competitive withstate of the art algorithms trained in a batch setting."
515,aaai,2022,Theoretical Guarantees of Fictitious Discount Algorithms for Episodic Reinforcement Learning and Global Convergence of Policy Gradient Methods,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20633,"When designing algorithms for finite-time-horizon episodic reinforcement learning problems, a common approach is to introduce a fictitious discount factor and use stationary policies for approximations. Empirically, it has been shown that the fictitious discount factor helps reduce variance, and stationary policies serve to save the per-iteration computational cost. Theoretically, however, there is no existing work on convergence analysis for algorithms with this fictitious discount recipe. This paper takes the first step towards analyzing these algorithms. It focuses on two vanilla policy gradient (VPG) variants: the first being a widely used variant with discounted advantage estimations (DAE), the second with an additional fictitious discount factor in the score functions of the policy gradient estimators. Non-asymptotic convergence guarantees are established for both algorithms, and the additional discount factor is shown to reduce the bias introduced in DAE and thus improve the algorithm convergence asymptotically. A key ingredient of our analysis is to connect three settings of Markov decision processes (MDPs): the finite-time-horizon, the average reward and the discounted settings. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical guarantee on fictitious discount algorithms for the episodic reinforcement learning of finite-time-horizon MDPs, which also leads to the (first) global convergence of policy gradient methods for finite-time-horizon episodic reinforcement learning."

We study the shortest path edge interdiction problem for defending Active Directory style attack graphs. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game between one defender and one attacker. The attack graph contains one destination node and multiple entry nodes. The attacker's entry node is chosen by nature. The defender chooses to block a set of edges limited by his budget. The attacker then picks the shortest unblocked attack path. The defender aims to maximize the expected shortest path length for the attacker, where the expectation is taken over entry nodes.   We observe that practical Active Directory attack graphs have small maximum attack path lengths and are structurally close to trees. We first show that even if the maximum attack path length is a constant, the problem is still $W[1]$-hard with respect to the defender's budget. Having a small maximum attack path length and a small budget is not enough to design fixed-parameter algorithms. If we further assume that the number of entry nodes is small, then we derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm.   We then propose two other fixed-parameter algorithms by exploiting the tree-like features. One is based on tree decomposition and requires a small tree width. The other assumes a small number of splitting nodes (nodes with multiple out-going edges). Finally, the last algorithm is converted into a graph convolutional neural network based heuristic, which scales to larger graphs with more splitting nodes."
517,aaai,2022,Learning Action Translator for Meta Reinforcement Learning on Sparse-Reward Tasks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20635,"Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) aims to learn a policy solving a set of training tasks simultaneously and quickly adapting to new tasks. It requires massive amounts of data drawn from training tasks to infer the common structure shared among tasks. Without heavy reward engineering, the sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks exacerbate the problem of sample efficiency in meta-RL. Another challenge in meta-RL is the discrepancy of difficulty level among tasks, which might cause one easy task dominating learning of the shared policy and thus preclude policy adaptation to new tasks. This work introduces a novel objective function to learn an action translator among training tasks. We theoretically verify that the value of the transferred policy with the action translator can be close to the value of the source policy and our objective function (approximately) upper bounds the value difference. We propose to combine the action translator with context-based meta-RL algorithms for better data collection and more efficient exploration during meta-training. Our approach empirically improves the sample efficiency and performance of meta-RL algorithms on sparse-reward tasks."

Although a quantized network has a smaller model size and memory footprint, it is fragile to adversarial attacks. However, few methods study the robustness and training efficiency of quantized networks. To this end, we propose a new method by recasting robust quantization as an online domain generalization problem, termed ODG-Q, which generates diverse adversarial data at a low cost during training. ODG-Q consistently outperforms existing works against various adversarial attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10 dataset, ODG-Q achieves 49.2% average improvements under five common white-box attacks and 21.7% average improvements under five common black-box attacks, with a training cost similar to that of natural training (viz. without adversaries). To our best knowledge, this work is the first work that trains both quantized and binary neural networks on ImageNet that consistently improve robustness under different attacks. We also provide a theoretical insight of ODG-Q that accounts for the bound of model risk on attacked data."

Compared to other image retrieval tasks, facial image retrieval is more challenging due to the high subjectivity involved in describing a person's facial features. Existing methods do so by comparing specific characteristics from the user's mental image against the suggested images via high-level supervision such as using natural language. In contrast, we propose a method that uses a relatively simpler form of binary supervision by utilizing the user's feedback to label images as either similar or dissimilar to the target image. Such supervision enables us to exploit the contrastive learning paradigm for encapsulating each user's personalized notion of similarity. For this, we propose a novel loss function optimized online via user feedback. We validate the efficacy of our proposed approach using a carefully designed testbed to simulate user feedback and a large-scale user study. Our experiments demonstrate that our method iteratively improves personalization, leading to faster convergence and enhanced recommendation relevance, thereby, improving user satisfaction. Our proposed framework is also equipped with a user-friendly web interface with a real-time experience for facial image retrieval."

However, the retrieval problem of such sequences remains largely unaddressed in literature. To tackle this, we propose NEUROSEQRET which learns to retrieve and rank a relevant set of continuous-time event sequences for a given query sequence, from a large corpus of sequences. More specifically, NEUROSEQRET first applies a trainable unwarping function on the query sequence, which makes it comparable with corpus sequences, especially when a relevant query-corpus pair has individually different attributes. Next, it feeds the unwarped query sequence and the corpus sequence into MTPP guided neural relevance models. We develop two variants of the relevance model which offer a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. We also propose an optimization framework to learn binary sequence embeddings from the relevance scores, suitable for the locality-sensitive hashing leading to a significant speedup in returning top-K results for a given query sequence. Our experiments with several datasets show the significant accuracy boost of NEUROSEQRET beyond several baselines, as well as the efficacy of our hashing mechanism."

Real-world complex systems often exhibit dynamic nature, where the interactions among nodes change over time in the form of a temporal network. Most temporal network generation models extend the static graph generation models by incorporating temporality in the generation process. More recently, temporal motifs are used to generate temporal networks with better success. However, existing models are often restricted to a small set of predefined motif patterns due to the high computational cost of counting temporal motifs. In this work, we develop a practical temporal graph generator, Motif Transition Model (MTM), to generate synthetic temporal networks with realistic global and local features. Our key idea is modeling the arrival of new events as temporal motif transition processes. We first calculate the transition properties from the input graph and then simulate the motif transition processes based on the transition probabilities and transition rates. We demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms the baselines with respect to preserving various global and local temporal graph statistics and runtime performance."

As these representations are high-dimensional, out-of-the-box methods like KMeans do not work well. Thus, our approach jointly transforms the representations into a lower-dimensional cluster-friendly space and clusters them. We consider two notions of syntax: Part of speech Induction (POSI) and constituency labelling (CoLab) in this work. Interestingly, we find that Multilingual BERT (mBERT) contains surprising amount of syntactic knowledge of English; possibly even as much as English BERT (EBERT). Our model can be used as a supervision-free probe which is arguably a less-biased way of probing. We find that unsupervised probes show benefits from higher layers as compared to supervised probes. We further note that our unsupervised probe utilizes EBERT and mBERT representations differently, especially for POSI. We validate the efficacy of our probe by demonstrating its capabilities as an unsupervised syntax induction technique. Our probe works well for both syntactic formalisms by simply adapting the input representations. We report competitive performance of our probe on 45-tag English POSI, state-of-the-art performance on 12-tag POSI across 10 languages, and competitive results on CoLab. We also perform zero-shot syntax induction on resource impoverished languages and report strong results."

Our analysis on data derived from a real-world food delivery platform across three large cities from India show that there is significant inequality in the money delivery agents earn. In this paper, we formulate the problem of fair income distribution among agents while also ensuring timely food delivery. We establish that the problem is not only NP-hard but also inapproximable in polynomial time. We overcome this computational bottleneck through a novel matching algorithm called FairFoody. Extensive experiments over real-world food delivery datasets show FairFoody imparts up to 10 times improvement in equitable income distribution when compared to baseline strategies, while also ensuring minimal impact on customer experience."

However, the primary focus has been on handling simple undirected graphs. Multi-relational graphs are a more general and prevalent form of graphs where each edge has a label and direction associated with it. Most of the existing approaches to handle such graphs suffer from over-parameterization and are restricted to learning representations of nodes only. In this paper, we propose CompGCN, a novel Graph Convolutional framework which jointly embeds both nodes and relations in a relational graph. CompGCN leverages a variety of entity-relation composition operations from Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques and scales with the number of relations. It also generalizes several of the existing multi-relational GCN methods.

Our approach yields a plug-and-play module that can be used as a drop-in replacement for any convolutional layer. Experimental results for image classification on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets using ResNet, MobileNetv2 and SeNet architectures substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We find that GKPD outperforms state-of-the-art decomposition methods including Tensor-Train and Tensor-Ring as well as other relevant compression methods such as pruning and knowledge distillation."
530,aaai,2022,The Complexity of Temporal Vertex Cover in Small-Degree Graphs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21259,"Covering all edges of a graph by a small number of vertices, this is the NP-complete Vertex Cover problem. It is among the most fundamental graph-algorithmic problems. Following a recent trend in studying temporal graphs (a sequence of graphs, so-called layers, over the same vertex set but, over time, changing edge sets), we initiate the study of Multistage Vertex Cover. Herein, given a temporal graph, the goal is to find for each layer of the temporal graph a small vertex cover and to guarantee that two vertex cover sets of every two consecutive layers differ not too much (specified by a given parameter). We show that, different from classic Vertex Cover and some other dynamic or temporal variants of it, Multistage Vertex Cover is computationally hard even in fairly restricted settings. On the positive side, however, we also spot several fixed-parameter tractability results based on some of the most natural parameterizations."
531,aaai,2022,Laneformer: Object-Aware Row-Column Transformers for Lane Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19961,"Modern cars are incorporating an increasing number of driver assist features, among which automatic lane keeping. The latter allows the car to properly position itself within the road lanes, which is also crucial for any subsequent lane departure or trajectory planning decision in fully autonomous cars. Traditional lane detection methods rely on a combination of highly-specialized, hand-crafted features and heuristics, usually followed by post-processing techniques, that are computationally expensive and prone to scalability due to road scene variations. More recent approaches leverage deep learning models, trained for pixel-wise lane segmentation, even when no markings are present in the image due to their big receptive field. Despite their advantages, these methods are limited to detecting a pre-defined, fixed number of lanes, e.g. ego-lanes, and can not cope with lane changes. In this paper, we go beyond the aforementioned limitations and propose to cast the lane detection problem as an instance segmentation problem - in which each lane forms its own instance - that can be trained end-to-end. To parametrize the segmented lane instances before fitting the lane, we further propose to apply a learned perspective transformation, conditioned on the image, in contrast to a fixed ""bird's-eye view"" transformation. By doing so, we ensure a lane fitting which is robust against road plane changes, unlike existing approaches that rely on a fixed, pre-defined transformation. In summary, we propose a fast lane detection algorithm, running at 50 fps, which can handle a variable number of lanes and cope with lane changes. We verify our method on the tuSimple dataset and achieve competitive results."

How to adapt state-of-the-art object detectors to the few-shot domain remains challenging. Object proposal is a key ingredient in modern object detectors. However, the quality of proposals generated for few-shot classes using existing methods is far worse than that of many-shot classes, e.g., missing boxes for few-shot classes due to misclassification or inaccurate spatial locations with respect to true objects. To address the noisy proposal problem, we propose a novel meta-learning based FSOD model by jointly optimizing the few-shot proposal generation and fine-grained few-shot proposal classification. To improve proposal generation for few-shot classes, we propose to learn a lightweight metric-learning based prototype matching network, instead of the conventional simple linear object/nonobject classifier, e.g., used in RPN. Our non-linear classifier with the feature fusion network could improve the discriminative prototype matching and the proposal recall for few-shot classes. To improve the fine-grained few-shot proposal classification, we propose a novel attentive feature alignment method to address the spatial misalignment between the noisy proposals and few-shot classes, thus improving the performance of few-shot object detection. Meanwhile we learn a separate Faster R-CNN detection head for many-shot base classes and show strong performance of maintaining base-classes knowledge. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple FSOD benchmarks over most of the shots and metrics."

However, owing to unsatisfactory feature embedding and imperfect clustering, pseudo labels for target domain data inherently contain an unknown proportion of wrong ones, which would mislead feature learning. In this paper, we propose an approach named probabilistic uncertainty guided progressive label refinery (P$^2$LR) for domain adaptive person re-identification. First, we propose to model the labeling uncertainty with the probabilistic distance along with ideal single-peak distributions. A quantitative criterion is established to measure the uncertainty of pseudo labels and facilitate the network training. Second, we explore a progressive strategy for refining pseudo labels. With the uncertainty-guided alternative optimization, we balance between the exploration of target domain data and the negative effects of noisy labeling. On top of a strong baseline, we obtain significant improvements and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on four UDA ReID benchmarks. Specifically, our method outperforms the baseline by 6.5% mAP on the Duke2Market task, while surpassing the state-of-the-art method by 2.5% mAP on the Market2MSMT task."
534,aaai,2022,Generalizable Person Re-identification via Self-Supervised Batch Norm Test-Time Adaption,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19963,"In this paper, we investigate the generalization problem of person re-identification (re-id), whose major challenge is the distribution shift on an unseen domain. As an important tool of regularizing the distribution, batch normalization (BN) has been widely used in existing methods. However, they neglect that BN is severely biased to the training domain and inevitably suffers the performance drop if directly generalized without being updated. To tackle this issue, we propose Batch Norm Test-time Adaption (BNTA), a novel re-id framework that applies the self-supervised strategy to update BN parameters adaptively. Specifically, BNTA quickly explores the domain-aware information within unlabeled target data before inference, and accordingly modulates the feature distribution normalized by BN to adapt to the target domain. This is accomplished by two designed self-supervised auxiliary tasks, namely part positioning and part nearest neighbor matching, which help the model mine the domain-aware information with respect to the structure and identity of body parts, respectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on three re-id datasets and confirm the superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods."

However, recurrent architectures face the challenge of exploding/vanishing gradients during training, and require significant computational resources to execute back-propagation through time. Moreover, large models are typically needed for executing complex sequential tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neuron model that has cosine activation with a time varying component for sequential processing. The proposed neuron provides an efficient building block for projecting sequential inputs into spectral domain, which helps to retain long-term dependencies with minimal extra model parameters and computation. A new type of recurrent network architecture, named Oscillatory Fourier Neural Network, based on the proposed neuron is presented and applied to various types of sequential tasks. We demonstrate that recurrent neural network with the proposed neuron model is mathematically equivalent to a simplified form of discrete Fourier transform applied onto periodical activation. In particular, the computationally intensive back-propagation through time in training is eliminated, leading to faster training while achieving the state of the art inference accuracy in a diverse group of sequential tasks. For instance, applying the proposed model to sentiment analysis on IMDB review dataset reaches 89.4% test accuracy within 5 epochs, accompanied by over 35x reduction in the model size compared to LSTM. The proposed novel RNN architecture is well poised for intelligent sequential processing in resource constrained hardware."
536,aaai,2022,Deep Representation Debiasing via Mutual Information Minimization and Maximization (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21619,"Deep learning algorithms mine knowledge from the training data and thus would likely inherit the dataset's bias information. As a result, the obtained model would generalize poorly and even mislead the decision process in real-life applications. We propose to remove the bias information misused by the target task with a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly extracts target and bias features disentangled from the latent representation generated by a feature extractor and then learns to discover and remove the correlation between the target and bias features. The correlation measurement plays a critical role in adversarial debiasing and is conducted by a cross-sample neural mutual information estimator. Moreover, we propose joint content and local structural representation learning to boost mutual information estimation for better performance. We conduct thorough experiments on publicly available datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches."

In this study, the endpoint-based part-aware curve skeleton (EPCS) extraction method for low-quality point clouds is proposed. The novel random center shift (RCS) method is first proposed for detecting the endpoints on point clouds. The endpoints are used as the initial seed points for dividing each part into layers, and then the skeletal points are obtained by computing the center points of the oriented bounding box (OBB) of the layers. Subsequently, the skeletal points are connected, thus forming the branches. Furthermore, the multi-vector momentum-driven (MVMD) method is also proposed for locating the junction points that connect the branches. Due to the shape differences between different parts on point clouds, the global topology of the skeleton is finally optimized by removing the redundant junction points, re-connecting some branches using the proposed MVMD method, and applying an interpolation method based on the splitting operator. Consequently, a complete and smooth curve skeleton is achieved. The proposed EPCS method is compared with several state-of-the-art methods, and the experimental results verify its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency. Furthermore, the skeleton extraction and model segmentation results on the point clouds of broken Terracotta also highlight the utility of the proposed method."

Many of those implicate profound and sometimes intricate questions of how humans interact or should interact with AIs. Moreover, many users or future users do have abstract ideas of what AI is, significantly depending on the specific embodiment of AI applications. Human-centered-design approaches would suggest evaluating the impact of different embodiments on human perception of and interaction with AI. An approach that is difficult to realize due to the sheer complexity of application fields and embodiments in reality. However, here XR opens new possibilities to research human-AI interactions. The article's contribution is twofold: First, it provides a theoretical treatment and model of human-AI interaction based on an XR-AI continuum as a framework for and a perspective of different approaches of XR-AI combinations. It motivates XR-AI combinations as a method to learn about the effects of prospective human-AI interfaces and shows why the combination of XR and AI fruitfully contributes to a valid and systematic investigation of human-AI interactions and interfaces. Second, the article provides two exemplary experiments investigating the aforementioned approach for two distinct AI-systems. The first experiment reveals an interesting gender effect in human-robot interaction, while the second experiment reveals an Eliza effect of a recommender system. Here the article introduces two paradigmatic implementations of the proposed XR testbed for human-AI interactions and interfaces and shows how a valid and systematic investigation can be conducted. In sum, the article opens new perspectives on how XR benefits human-centered AI design and development."

In this paper we study the following type of problems: given an integer $k$, the problem asks for $k$ solutions such that the sum of pairwise (weighted) Hamming distances between these solutions is maximized. Such solutions are called diverse solutions. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding diverse shortest $st$-paths in weighted directed graphs. Moreover, we study the diverse version of other classical combinatorial problems such as diverse weighted matroid bases, diverse weighted arborescences, and diverse bipartite matchings. We show that these problems can be solved in polynomial time as well. To evaluate the practical performance of our algorithm for finding diverse shortest $st$-paths, we conduct a computational experiment with synthetic and real-world instances.The experiment shows that our algorithm successfully computes diverse solutions within reasonable computational time."

The goal is to generalise from an initial large-scale classification task to a separate task comprising new classes and small numbers of examples. The new approach not only leverages the feature-based representation learned by a neural network from the initial task (representational transfer), but also information about the classes (concept transfer). The concept information is encapsulated in a probabilistic model for the final layer weights of the neural network which acts as a prior for probabilistic k-shot learning. We show that even a simple probabilistic model achieves state-of-the-art on a standard k-shot learning dataset by a large margin. Moreover, it is able to accurately model uncertainty, leading to well calibrated classifiers, and is easily extensible and flexible, unlike many recent approaches to k-shot learning."

This paper shows that, with convex, strictly increasing and differentiable arc cost functions, an atomic splittable player always has an optimal unilateral decentralization strategy. Besides, unilateral decentralization gives her the same advantage as being the leader in a Stackelberg congestion game. Finally, unilateral decentralization of an atomic player has a negative impact on the social cost and on the costs of the other players at the equilibrium of the congestion game."

Despite the wealth of information available in the log data of user-item interactions, it has been mostly used for collaborative filtering to find similar items or users and was not fully investigated for content-based music applications. We resolve this problem by extending intra-domain knowledge distillation to cross-domain: i.e., by transferring knowledge obtained from the user-item domain to the music content domain. The proposed system first trains the model that estimates log information from the audio contents; then it uses the model to improve other task-specific models. The experiments on various music classification and regression tasks show that the proposed method successfully improves the performances of the task-specific models."

Approaches that enable such control in a zero-shot manner would be of great importance as, among other reasons, they remove the need for additional annotated data and training. In this work, we propose novel approaches for controlling encoder-decoder transformer-based NLG models in zero-shot. This is done by introducing three control knobs, namely, attention biasing, decoder mixing, and context augmentation, that are applied to these models at generation time. These knobs control the generation process by directly manipulating trained NLG models (e.g., biasing cross-attention layers) to realize the desired attributes in the generated outputs. We show that not only are these NLG models robust to such manipulations, but also their behavior could be controlled without an impact on their generation performance. These results, to the best of our knowledge, are the first of their kind. Through these control knobs, we also investigate the role of transformer decoder's self-attention module and show strong evidence that its primary role is maintaining fluency of sentences generated by these models. Based on this hypothesis, we show that alternative architectures for transformer decoders could be viable options. We also study how this hypothesis could lead to more efficient ways for training encoder-decoder transformer models."
547,aaai,2022,Multi-Mode Tensor Space Clustering Based on Low-Tensor-Rank Representation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20646,"Tensor-oriented multi-view subspace clustering has achieved significant strides in assessing high-order correlations and improving clustering analysis of multi-view data. Nevertheless, most of existing investigations are typically hampered by the two flaws. First, self-representation based tensor subspace learning usually induces high time and space complexity, and is limited in perceiving nonlinear local structure in the embedding space. Second, the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) model redistributes each singular value equally without considering the diverse importance among them. To well cope with the issues, we propose a hyper-Laplacian regularized concept factorization (HLRCF) in low-rank tensor space for multi-view clustering. Specifically, we adopt the concept factorization to explore the latent cluster-wise representation of each view. Further, the hypergraph Laplacian regularization endows the model with the capability of extracting the nonlinear local structures in the latent space. Considering that different tensor singular values associate structural information with unequal importance, we develop a self-weighted tensor Schatten p-norm to constrain the tensor comprised of all cluster-wise representations. Notably, the tensor with smaller size greatly decreases the time and space complexity in the low-rank optimization. Finally, experimental results on eight benchmark datasets exhibit that HLRCF outperforms other multi-view methods, showingcasing its superior performance."

To address this issue, we make the first attempt to perform textual reasoning based on visual semantics in this paper. Technically, given the character segmentation maps predicted by a VR model, we construct a subgraph for each instance, where nodes represent the pixels in it and edges are added between nodes based on their spatial similarity. Then, these subgraphs are sequentially connected by their root nodes and merged into a complete graph. Based on this graph, we devise a graph convolutional network for textual reasoning (GTR) by supervising it with a cross-entropy loss. GTR can be easily plugged in representative STR models to improve their performance owing to better textual reasoning. Specifically, we construct our model, namely S-GTR, by paralleling GTR to the language model in a segmentation-based STR baseline, which can effectively exploit the visual-linguistic complementarity via mutual learning. S-GTR sets new state-of-the-art on six challenging STR benchmarks and generalizes well to multi-linguistic datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/adeline-cs/GTR."

However, current pre-training methods mainly focus on enhancing dialog understanding and generation tasks while neglecting the exploitation of dialog policy. In this paper, we propose GALAXY, a novel pre-trained dialog model that explicitly learns dialog policy from limited labeled dialogs and large-scale unlabeled dialog corpora via semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we introduce a dialog act prediction task for policy optimization during pre-training and employ a consistency regularization term to refine the learned representation with the help of unlabeled dialogs. We also implement a gating mechanism to weigh suitable unlabeled dialog samples. Empirical results show that GALAXY substantially improves the performance of task-oriented dialog systems, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets: In-Car, MultiWOZ2.0 and MultiWOZ2.1, improving their end-to-end combined scores by 2.5, 5.3 and 5.5 points, respectively.

The key idea of our approach is to represent discrete point clouds as continuous probability density functions using Gaussian mixture models. Scene flow estimation is therefore converted into the problem of recovering motion from the alignment of probability density functions, which we achieve using a closed-form expression of the classic Cauchy-Schwarz divergence. Unlike existing nearest-neighbor-based approaches that use hard pairwise correspondences, our proposed approach establishes soft and implicit point correspondences between point clouds and generates more robust and accurate scene flow in the presence of missing correspondences and outliers. Comprehensive experiments show that our method makes noticeable gains over the Chamfer Distance and the Earth Mover's Distance in real-world environments and achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised learning methods on FlyingThings3D and KITTI, even outperforming some supervised methods with ground truth annotations."

Traditional methods mainly focus on designing the image-level or box-level feature propagation strategies to exploit temporal information. This paper argues that with a more effective and efficient feature propagation framework, video object detectors can gain improvement in terms of both accuracy and speed. For this purpose, this paper studies object-level feature propagation, and proposes an object query propagation (QueryProp) framework for high-performance video object detection. The proposed QueryProp contains two propagation strategies: 1) query propagation is performed from sparse key frames to dense non-key frames to reduce the redundant computation on non-key frames; 2) query propagation is performed from previous key frames to the current key frame to improve feature representation by temporal context modeling. To further facilitate query propagation, an adaptive propagation gate is designed to achieve flexible key frame selection. We conduct extensive experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset. QueryProp achieves comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods and strikes a decent accuracy/speed trade-off. Code is available at https://github.com/hf1995/QueryProp."

Reinforcement learning by policy optimization would be a natural way to solve this due to its ability to address stochasticity, plant-model mismatch, and directly account for the effect of future uncertainty and its feedback in a proper closed-loop manner; all without the need of an inner optimization loop. One of the main reasons why reinforcement learning has not been considered for industrial processes (or almost any engineering application) is that it lacks a framework to deal with safety critical constraints. Present algorithms for policy optimization use difficult-to-tune penalty parameters, fail to reliably satisfy state constraints or present guarantees only in expectation. We propose a chance constrained policy optimization (CCPO) algorithm which guarantees the satisfaction of joint chance constraints with a high probability - which is crucial for safety critical tasks. This is achieved by the introduction of constraint tightening (backoffs), which are computed simultaneously with the feedback policy. Backoffs are adjusted with Bayesian optimization using the empirical cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic constraints, and are therefore self-tuned. This results in a general methodology that can be imbued into present policy optimization algorithms to enable them to satisfy joint chance constraints with high probability. We present case studies that analyze the performance of the proposed approach."

These pre-trained policies can accelerate learning when endowed with external reward, and can also be used as primitive options in hierarchical reinforcement learning. Conventional approaches of unsupervised skill discovery feed a latent variable to the agent and shed its empowerment on agent's behavior by mutual information (MI) maximization. However, the policies learned by MI-based methods cannot sufficiently explore the state space, despite they can be successfully identified from each other. Therefore we propose a new framework Wasserstein unsupervised reinforcement learning (WURL) where we directly maximize the distance of state distributions induced by different policies. Additionally, we overcome difficulties in simultaneously training N(N >2) policies, and amortizing the overall reward to each step. Experiments show policies learned by our approach outperform MI-based methods on the metric of Wasserstein distance while keeping high discriminability. Furthermore, the agents trained by WURL can sufficiently explore the state space in mazes and MuJoCo tasks and the pre-trained policies can be applied to downstream tasks by hierarchical learning."

We suggest that these models can be considered as special cases of a generalized convolution operation, named channel local convolution(CLC), where an output channel is computed using a subset of the input channels. This definition entails computation dependency relations between input and output channels, which can be represented by a channel dependency graph(CDG). By modifying the CDG of grouped convolution, a new CLC kernel named interlaced grouped convolution (IGC) is created. Stacking IGC and GC kernels results in a convolution block (named CLC Block) for approximating regular convolution. By resorting to the CDG as an analysis tool, we derive the rule for setting the meta-parameters of IGC and GC and the framework for minimizing the computational cost. A new CNN model named clcNet is then constructed using CLC blocks, which shows significantly higher computational efficiency and fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art networks, when being tested using the ImageNet-1K dataset.

However, collaboration is hard to achieve, partly because no global authority can ensure compliance with international climate agreements. Combining AI with climate-economic simulations offers a promising solution to design international frameworks, including negotiation protocols and climate agreements, that promote and incentivize collaboration. In addition, these frameworks should also have policy goals fulfillment, and sustained commitment, taking into account climate-economic dynamics and strategic behaviors. These challenges require an interdisciplinary approach across machine learning, economics, climate science, law, policy, ethics, and other fields.   Towards this objective, we organized AI for Global Climate Cooperation, a Mila competition in which teams submitted proposals and analyses of international frameworks, based on (modifications of) RICE-N, an AI-driven integrated assessment model (IAM). In particular, RICE-N supports modeling regional decision-making using AI agents. Furthermore, the IAM then models the climate-economic impact of those decisions into the future.   Whereas the first track focused only on performance metrics, the proposals submitted to the second track were evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative evaluation focused on a combination of (i) the degree of mitigation of global temperature rise and (ii) the increase in economic productivity. On the other hand, an interdisciplinary panel of human experts in law, policy, sociology, economics and environmental science, evaluated the solutions qualitatively. In particular, the panel considered the effectiveness, simplicity, feasibility, ethics, and notions of climate justice of the protocols. In the third track, the participants were asked to critique and improve RICE-N."
558,aaai,2022,SECRET: Self-Consistent Pseudo Label Refinement for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Person Re-identification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19970,"Person re-identification (re-ID) aims at identifying the same persons' images across different cameras. However, domain diversities between different datasets pose an evident challenge for adapting the re-ID model trained on one dataset to another one. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods for person re-ID transferred the learned knowledge from the source domain by optimizing with pseudo labels created by clustering algorithms on the target domain. Although they achieved state-of-the-art performances, the inevitable label noise caused by the clustering procedure was ignored. Such noisy pseudo labels substantially hinders the model's capability on further improving feature representations on the target domain. In order to mitigate the effects of noisy pseudo labels, we propose to softly refine the pseudo labels in the target domain by proposing an unsupervised framework, Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT), to learn better features from the target domain via off-line refined hard pseudo labels and on-line refined soft pseudo labels in an alternative training manner. In addition, the common practice is to adopt both the classification loss and the triplet loss jointly for achieving optimal performances in person re-ID models. However, conventional triplet loss cannot work with softly refined labels. To solve this problem, a novel soft softmax-triplet loss is proposed to support learning with soft pseudo triplet labels for achieving the optimal domain adaptation performance. The proposed MMT framework achieves considerable improvements of 14.4%, 18.2%, 13.1% and 16.4% mAP on Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.

As the basic format of 3D data, the point cloud can provide detailed geometric information about the objects in the original 3D space. However, due to 3D data's sparsity and unorderedness, specially designed networks and modules are needed to process this type of data. Attention mechanism has achieved impressive performance in diverse computer vision tasks; however, it is unclear how attention modules would affect the performance of 3D point cloud object detection and what sort of attention modules could fit with the inherent properties of 3D data. This work investigates the role of the attention mechanism in 3D point cloud object detection and provides insights into the potential of different attention modules. To achieve that, we comprehensively investigate classical 2D attentions, novel 3D attentions, including the latest point cloud transformers on SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2 datasets. Based on the detailed experiments and analysis, we conclude the effects of different attention modules. This paper is expected to serve as a reference source for benefiting attention-embedded 3D point cloud object detection.

560,aaai,2022,Protecting Intellectual Property of Language Generation APIs with Lexical Watermark,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21321,"Nowadays, due to the breakthrough in natural language generation (NLG), including machine translation, document summarization, image captioning, etc NLG models have been encapsulated in cloud APIs to serve over half a billion people worldwide and process over one hundred billion word generations per day. Thus, NLG APIs have already become essential profitable services in many commercial companies. Due to the substantial financial and intellectual investments, service providers adopt a pay-as-you-use policy to promote sustainable market growth. However, recent works have shown that cloud platforms suffer from financial losses imposed by model extraction attacks, which aim to imitate the functionality and utility of the victim services, thus violating the intellectual property (IP) of cloud APIs. This work targets at protecting IP of NLG APIs by identifying the attackers who have utilized watermarked responses from the victim NLG APIs. However, most existing watermarking techniques are not directly amenable for IP protection of NLG APIs. To bridge this gap, we first present a novel watermarking method for text generation APIs by conducting lexical modification to the original outputs. Compared with the competitive baselines, our watermark approach achieves better identifiable performance in terms of p-value, with fewer semantic losses. In addition, our watermarks are more understandable and intuitive to humans than the baselines. Finally, the empirical studies show our approach is also applicable to queries from different domains, and is effective on the attacker trained on a mixture of the corpus which includes less than 10\% watermarked samples."

In this work, we explore the task of lip to speech synthesis, i.e., learning to generate speech given only the lip movements of a speaker where we focus on learning accurate lip to speech mappings for multiple speakers in unconstrained, large vocabulary settings. We capture the speaker's voice identity through their facial characteristics, i.e., age, gender, ethnicity and condition them along with the lip movements to generate speaker identity aware speech. To this end, we present a novel method ""Lip2Speech"", with key design choices to achieve accurate lip to speech synthesis in unconstrained scenarios. We also perform various experiments and extensive evaluation using quantitative, qualitative metrics and human evaluation."
562,aaai,2022,CATN: Cross Attentive Tree-Aware Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20320,"Time series forecasting is an important yet challenging task. Though deep learning methods have recently been developed to give superior forecasting results, it is crucial to improve the interpretability of time series models. Previous interpretation methods, including the methods for general neural networks and attention-based methods, mainly consider the interpretation in the feature dimension while ignoring the crucial temporal dimension. In this paper, we present the series saliency framework for temporal interpretation for multivariate time series forecasting, which considers the forecasting interpretation in both feature and temporal dimensions. By extracting the ""series images"" from the sliding windows of the time series, we apply the saliency map segmentation following the smallest destroying region principle. The series saliency framework can be employed to any well-defined deep learning models and works as a data augmentation to get more accurate forecasts. Experimental results on several real datasets demonstrate that our framework generates temporal interpretations for the time series forecasting task while produces accurate time series forecast."

In order to leverage architectures in 2D detectors, they often convert 3D point clouds to regular grids (i.e., to voxel grids or to bird's eye view images), or rely on detection in 2D images to propose 3D boxes. Few works have attempted to directly detect objects in point clouds. In this work, we return to first principles to construct a 3D detection pipeline for point cloud data and as generic as possible. However, due to the sparse nature of the data -- samples from 2D manifolds in 3D space -- we face a major challenge when directly predicting bounding box parameters from scene points: a 3D object centroid can be far from any surface point thus hard to regress accurately in one step. To address the challenge, we propose VoteNet, an end-to-end 3D object detection network based on a synergy of deep point set networks and Hough voting. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection on two large datasets of real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D with a simple design, compact model size and high efficiency. Remarkably, VoteNet outperforms previous methods by using purely geometric information without relying on color images."

A number of empirical studies have collected and analyzed data on contacts between individuals using a variety of sensors. Typically one uses such data to fit a probabilistic model of network contacts over which a disease may propagate. In this paper, we investigate the effects of different contact network models with varying levels of complexity on the outcomes of simulated epidemics using a stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. We evaluate these network models on six datasets of contacts between people in a variety of settings. Our results demonstrate that the choice of network model can have a significant effect on how closely the outcomes of an epidemic simulation on a simulated network match the outcomes on the actual network constructed from the sensor data. In particular, preserving degrees of nodes appears to be much more important than preserving cluster structure for accurate epidemic simulations."

Nevertheless, directly measuring the entanglement of a many-particle system is very challenging. Here we show that via supervised machine learning using a convolutional neural network, we can infer the entanglement from a measurable observable for a disordered interacting quantum many-particle system. Several structures of neural networks were tested and a convolutional neural network akin to structures used for image and speech recognition performed the best. After training on a set of 500 realizations of disorder, the network was applied to 200 new realizations and its results for the entanglement entropy were compared to a direct computation of the entanglement entropy. Excellent agreement was found, except for several rare region which in a previous study were identified as belonging to an inclusion of a Griffiths-like quantum phase. Training the network on a test set with different parameters (in the same phase) also works quite well."

We show that for multi-unit auctions, of which bundle auctions are a special case, market equilibrium and constrained market equilibrium are equivalent concepts. This equivalence, allows us to obtain a computable necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of constrained market equilibrium for bundle auctions. We use this result to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of market equilibrium for multi-unit auctions. After obtaining the induced bundle auction of a nonnegative TU game, we show that the existence of market equilibrium implies the existence of a possibly different market equilibrium as well, which corresponds very naturally to an outcome in the matching core of the TU game. Consequently we show that the matching core of the nonnegative TU game is non-empty if and only if the induced market game has a market equilibrium."

Monitoring air pollution is useful to learn more about the link between health and pollutants, and to identify areas for intervention. Such monitoring is expensive, so it is important to place sensors as efficiently as possible. Bayesian optimisation has proven useful in choosing sensor locations, but typically relies on kernel functions that neglect the statistical structure of air pollution, such as the tendency of pollution to propagate in the prevailing wind direction. We describe two new wind-informed kernels and investigate their advantage for the task of actively learning locations of maximum pollution using Bayesian optimisation."

However, parents of children aged 6-11 often believe that children are too young to face or comprehend online privacy issues, and often take a protective approach to restrict or monitor what children can access online, instead of discussing privacy issues with children. Parents work hard to protect their children's online safety. However, little is known how much parents are aware of the risks associated with the implicit personal data collection by the first- or third-party companies behind the mobile `apps' used by their children, and hence how well parents can safeguard their children from this kind of risks.   Parents have always been playing a pivotal role in mitigating children's interactions with digital technologies --- from TV to game consoles, to personal computers --- but the rapidly changing technologies are posing challenges for parents to keep up with. There is a pressing need to understand how much parents are aware of privacy risks concerning the use of tablets and how they are managing them for their primary school-aged young children. At the same time, we must also reach out to the children themselves, who are on the frontline of these technologies, to learn how capable they are to recognise risks and how well they are supported by their parents to cope with these risks. Therefore, in the summer of 2017, we conducted face-to-face interviews with 12 families in Oxfordshire and an online survey with 250 parents. This report summarises our key findings of these two studies."
569,aaai,2022,Reinforcement Learning of Causal Variables Using Mediation Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20648,"Many open problems in machine learning are intrinsically related to causality, however, the use of causal analysis in machine learning is still in its early stage. Within a general reinforcement learning setting, we consider the problem of building a general reinforcement learning agent which uses experience to construct a causal graph of the environment, and use this graph to inform its policy. Our approach has three characteristics: First, we learn a simple, coarse-grained causal graph, in which the variables reflect states at many time instances, and the interventions happen at the level of policies, rather than individual actions. Secondly, we use mediation analysis to obtain an optimization target. By minimizing this target, we define the causal variables. Thirdly, our approach relies on estimating conditional expectations rather the familiar expected return from reinforcement learning, and we therefore apply a generalization of Bellman's equations. We show the method can learn a plausible causal graph in a grid-world environment, and the agent obtains an improvement in performance when using the causally informed policy. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply causal analysis in a reinforcement learning setting without strict restrictions on the number of states. We have observed that mediation analysis provides a promising avenue for transforming the problem of causal acquisition into one of cost-function minimization, but importantly one which involves estimating conditional expectations. This is a new challenge, and we think that causal reinforcement learning will involve development methods suited for online estimation of such conditional expectations. Finally, a benefit of our approach is the use of very simple causal models, which are arguably a more natural model of human causal understanding."

The AI's strength is closely related to its diversity of strategies, and this relationship can guide us to train AI with both strong and rich strategies. To prove this point, we propose Diversity is Strength (DIS), a novel DRL training framework that can simultaneously train multiple kinds of AIs. These AIs are linked through an interconnected history model pool structure, which enhances their capabilities and strategy diversities. We also design a model evaluation and screening scheme to select the best models to enrich the model pool and obtain the final AI. The proposed training method provides diverse, generalizable, and strong AI strategies without using human data. We tested our method in an AI competition based on Google Research Football (GRF) and won the 5v5 and 11v11 tracks. The method enables a GRF AI to have a high level on both 5v5 and 11v11 tracks for the first time, which are under complex multi-agent environments. The behavior analysis shows that the trained AI has rich strategies, and the ablation experiments proved that the designed modules benefit the training process."

This paper explores whether we can satisfy and/or improve these fairness measures simultaneously to a certain degree. We introduce information-theoretic formulations of the fairness measures and define degrees of fairness based on these formulations. The information-theoretic formulations suggest unexplored theoretical relations between the three fairness measures. In the experimental part, we use the information-theoretic expressions as regularizers to obtain fairness-regularized predictors for three standard datasets. Our experiments show that a) fairness regularization directly increases fairness measures, in line with existing work, and b) some fairness regularizations indirectly increase other fairness measures, as suggested by our theoretical findings. This establishes that it is possible to increase the degree to which some fairness measures are satisfied at the same time -- some fairness measures are gradually compatible."

Different criteria used to settle the acceptance of arguments are called semantics. Semantics of ADFs have so far mainly been defined based on the concept of admissibility. However, the notion of strongly admissible semantics studied for abstract argumentation frameworks has not yet been introduced for ADFs. In the current work we present the concept of strong admissibility of interpretations for ADFs. Further, we show that strongly admissible interpretations of ADFs form a lattice with the grounded interpretation as top element."

However, combining these measures into an efficient holistic pandemic response instrument is even more involved than anticipated. We argue that some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these measures are selfish decision making and the differing national implementations of the response mechanism. In this paper, through simple games, we show the effect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to mask wearing, social distancing and vaccination, and how these may result in sub-optimal outcomes. We also demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games properly regarding data transparency, the chosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome. We promote a mechanism design approach: it is in the best interest of every government to carefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their respective pandemic response mechanism; moreover, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when designing an effective solution."

We find that a straight-through-estimator, a method introduced to train binary neural networks, could effectively be applied to incorporate logical constraints into neural network learning. More specifically, we design a systematic way to represent discrete logical constraints as a loss function; minimizing this loss using gradient descent via a straight-through-estimator updates the neural network's weights in the direction that the binarized outputs satisfy the logical constraints. The experimental results show that by leveraging GPUs and batch training, this method scales significantly better than existing neuro-symbolic methods that require heavy symbolic computation for computing gradients. Also, we demonstrate that our method applies to different types of neural networks, such as MLP, CNN, and GNN, making them learn with no or fewer labeled data by learning directly from known constraints."

In contrast to the standard InfoNCE loss, which requires a strict binary separation of the training pairs into similar and dissimilar samples, RINCE can exploit information about a similarity ranking for learning a corresponding embedding space. We show that the proposed loss function learns favorable embeddings compared to the standard InfoNCE whenever at least noisy ranking information can be obtained or when the definition of positives and negatives is blurry. We demonstrate this for a supervised classification task with additional superclass labels and noisy similarity scores. Furthermore, we show that RINCE can also be applied to unsupervised training with experiments on unsupervised representation learning from videos. In particular, the embedding yields higher classification accuracy, retrieval rates and performs better in out-of-distribution detection than the standard InfoNCE loss."

Here we explore a modified ""anytime online-to-batch"" mechanism which for smooth objectives admits high-probability error bounds while requiring only lower-order moment bounds on the stochastic gradients. Using this conversion, we can derive a wide variety of ""anytime robust"" procedures, for which the task of performance analysis can be effectively reduced to regret control, meaning that existing regret bounds (for the bounded gradient case) can be robustified and leveraged in a straightforward manner. As a direct takeaway, we obtain an easily implemented stochastic gradient-based algorithm for which all queried points formally enjoy sub-Gaussian error bounds, and in practice show noteworthy gains on real-world data applications."

Most previous image composition methods focus on adjusting the foreground to make it compatible with background while ignoring the shadow effect of foreground on the background. In this work, we focus on generating plausible shadow for the foreground object in the composite image. First, we contribute a real-world shadow generation dataset DESOBA by generating synthetic composite images based on paired real images and deshadowed images. Then, we propose a novel shadow generation network SGRNet, which consists of a shadow mask prediction stage and a shadow filling stage. In the shadow mask prediction stage, foreground and background information are thoroughly interacted to generate foreground shadow mask. In the shadow filling stage, shadow parameters are predicted to fill the shadow area. Extensive experiments on our DESOBA dataset and real composite images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Existing attacks aim at injecting the attack signals over the air, but they require the access to the authorized user's voice for activating the voice assistants. Moreover, the effectiveness of the attacks can be greatly deteriorated in a noisy environment. In this paper, we explore a new type of channel, the power line side-channel, to launch the inaudible voice command injection. By injecting the audio signals over the power line through a modified charging cable, the attack becomes more resilient against various environmental factors and liveness detection models. Meanwhile, the smartphone audio output can be eavesdropped through the modified cable, enabling a highly-interactive attack.   To exploit the power line side-channel, we present GhostTalk, a new hidden voice attack that is capable of injecting and eavesdropping simultaneously. Via a quick modification of the power bank cables, the attackers could launch interactive attacks by remotely making a phone call or capturing private information from the voice assistants. GhostTalk overcomes the challenge of bypassing the speaker verification system by stealthily triggering a switch component to simulate the press button on the headphone. In case when the smartphones are charged by an unaltered standard cable, we discover that it is possible to recover the audio signal from smartphone loudspeakers by monitoring the charging current on the power line. To demonstrate the feasibility, we design GhostTalk-SC, an adaptive eavesdropper system targeting smartphones charged in the public USB ports. To correctly recognize the private information in the audio, GhostTalk-SC carefully extracts audio spectra and integrates a neural network model to classify spoken digits in the speech."

Many recent studies try to solve the task by developing pre-trained language models focusing on combining visual features from document images with texts and their layout. On the other hand, this paper tackles the problem by going back to the basic: effective combination of text and layout. Specifically, we propose a pre-trained language model, named BROS (BERT Relying On Spatiality), that encodes relative positions of texts in 2D space and learns from unlabeled documents with area-masking strategy. With this optimized training scheme for understanding texts in 2D space, BROS shows comparable or better performance compared to previous methods on four KIE benchmarks (FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and SciTSR) without relying on visual features. This paper also reveals two real-world challenges in KIE tasks-(1) minimizing the error from incorrect text ordering and (2) efficient learning from fewer downstream examples-and demonstrates the superiority of BROS over previous methods.

On the other hand, the dehazing task should take into account the subjective factor, which is to give the user selectable dehazed images rather than a single result. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-output dehazing network by introducing illumination controllable ability, called IC-Dehazing. The proposed IC-Dehazing can change the illumination intensity by adjusting the factor of the illumination controllable module, which is realized based on the interpretable Retinex theory. Moreover, the backbone dehazing network of IC-Dehazing consists of a Transformer with double decoders for high-quality image restoration. Further, the prior-based loss function and unsupervised training strategy enable IC-Dehazing to complete the parameter learning process without the need for paired data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IC-Dehazing, quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on image dehazing, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks.

But we have developed a Theorem Proving Lifted Heuristic (TPLH) planner that searches for a plan in a tree of situations using the A* search algorithm. It is controlled by a delete relaxation-based domain independent heuristic. We compare TPLH with Fast Downward (FD) and Best First Width Search (BFWS) planners over several standard benchmarks. Since our implementation of the heuristic function is not optimized, TPLH is slower than FD and BFWS. But it computes shorter plans, and it explores fewer states. We discuss previous research on planning within KR\&R and identify related directions. Thus, we show that deductive lifted heuristic planning in situation calculus is actually doable."

Yet, the widely adopted horizontal bounding box representation is not appropriate for ubiquitous oriented objects such as objects in aerial images and scene texts. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework to detect multi-oriented objects. Instead of directly regressing the four vertices, we glide the vertex of the horizontal bounding box on each corresponding side to accurately describe a multi-oriented object. Specifically, We regress four length ratios characterizing the relative gliding offset on each corresponding side. This may facilitate the offset learning and avoid the confusion issue of sequential label points for oriented objects. To further remedy the confusion issue for nearly horizontal objects, we also introduce an obliquity factor based on area ratio between the object and its horizontal bounding box, guiding the selection of horizontal or oriented detection for each object. We add these five extra target variables to the regression head of faster R-CNN, which requires ignorable extra computation time. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that without bells and whistles, the proposed method achieves superior performances on multiple multi-oriented object detection benchmarks including object detection in aerial images, scene text detection, pedestrian detection in fisheye images."

However, existing methods tend to focus on advanced aggregators with different structures, often overlooking the intrinsic features of H\&E pathological slides. To address this limitation, we introduced two pathological priors: nuclear heterogeneity of diseased cells and spatial correlation of pathological tiles. Leveraging the former, we proposed a data augmentation method that utilizes stain separation during extractor training via a contrastive learning strategy to obtain instance-level representations. We then described the spatial relationships between the tiles using an adjacency matrix. By integrating these two views, we designed a multi-instance framework for analyzing H\&E-stained tissue images based on pathological inductive bias, encompassing feature extraction, filtering, and aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Camelyon16 breast dataset and TCGA-NSCLC Lung dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively handle tasks related to cancer detection and differentiation of subtypes, outperforming state-of-the-art medical image classification methods based on MIL. The code will be released later."

However, current studies focus on supervised learning tasks, relying on the ground-truth data label, a targeted objective, or supervision from a trained classifier. In this paper, we propose a framework of generating adversarial examples for unsupervised models and demonstrate novel applications to data augmentation. Our framework exploits a mutual information neural estimator as an information-theoretic similarity measure to generate adversarial examples without supervision. We propose a new MinMax algorithm with provable convergence guarantees for efficient generation of unsupervised adversarial examples. Our framework can also be extended to supervised adversarial examples. When using unsupervised adversarial examples as a simple plug-in data augmentation tool for model retraining, significant improvements are consistently observed across different unsupervised tasks and datasets, including data reconstruction, representation learning, and contrastive learning. Our results show novel methods and considerable advantages in studying and improving unsupervised machine learning via adversarial examples."

This human variability factor adds more complexity since policies deemed fair at one point in time may become discriminatory over time due to variations in human preferences resulting from inter- and intra-human variability. This paper addresses the fairness problem from an equity lens, considering human behavior variability, and the changes in human preferences over time. We propose FAIRO, a novel algorithm for fairness-aware sequential-decision making in HITL adaptation, which incorporates these notions into the decision-making process. In particular, FAIRO decomposes this complex fairness task into adaptive sub-tasks based on individual human preferences through leveraging the Options reinforcement learning framework. We design FAIRO to generalize to three types of HITL application setups that have the shared adaptation decision problem. Furthermore, we recognize that fairness-aware policies can sometimes conflict with the application's utility. To address this challenge, we provide a fairness-utility tradeoff in FAIRO, allowing system designers to balance the objectives of fairness and utility based on specific application requirements. Extensive evaluations of FAIRO on the three HITL applications demonstrate its generalizability and effectiveness in promoting fairness while accounting for human variability. On average, FAIRO can improve fairness compared with other methods across all three applications by 35.36%."
586,aaai,2022,Bi-volution: A Static and Dynamic Coupled Filter,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19979,"The joint bilateral filter, which enables feature-preserving signal smoothing according to the structural information from a guidance, has been applied for various tasks in geometry processing. Existing methods either rely on a static guidance that may be inconsistent with the input and lead to unsatisfactory results, or a dynamic guidance that is automatically updated but sensitive to noises and outliers. Inspired by recent advances in image filtering, we propose a new geometry filtering technique called static/dynamic filter, which utilizes both static and dynamic guidances to achieve state-of-the-art results. The proposed filter is based on a nonlinear optimization that enforces smoothness of the signal while preserving variations that correspond to features of certain scales. We develop an efficient iterative solver for the problem, which unifies existing filters that are based on static or dynamic guidances. The filter can be applied to mesh face normals followed by vertex position update, to achieve scale-aware and feature-preserving filtering of mesh geometry. It also works well for other types of signals defined on mesh surfaces, such as texture colors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter for various geometry processing applications such as mesh denoising, geometry feature enhancement, and texture color filtering."
587,aaai,2022,AFDetV2: Rethinking the Necessity of the Second Stage for Object Detection from Point Clouds,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19980,"There have been two streams in the 3D detection from point clouds: single-stage methods and two-stage methods. While the former is more computationally efficient, the latter usually provides better detection accuracy. By carefully examining the two-stage approaches, we have found that if appropriately designed, the first stage can produce accurate box regression. In this scenario, the second stage mainly rescores the boxes such that the boxes with better localization get selected. From this observation, we have devised a single-stage anchor-free network that can fulfill these requirements. This network, named AFDetV2, extends the previous work by incorporating a self-calibrated convolution block in the backbone, a keypoint auxiliary supervision, and an IoU prediction branch in the multi-task head. As a result, the detection accuracy is drastically boosted in the single-stage. To evaluate our approach, we have conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset. We have observed that our AFDetV2 achieves the state-of-the-art results on these two datasets, superior to all the prior arts, including both the single-stage and the two-stage 3D detectors. AFDetV2 won the 1st place in the Real-Time 3D Detection of the Waymo Open Dataset Challenge 2021. In addition, a variant of our model AFDetV2-Base was entitled the ""Most Efficient Model"" by the Challenge Sponsor, showing a superior computational efficiency. To demonstrate the generality of this single-stage method, we have also applied it to the first stage of the two-stage networks. Without exception, the results show that with the strengthened backbone and the rescoring approach, the second stage refinement is no longer needed."

In fact, due to their structure (especially with small sizes), these models are inherently understandable by humans. Recently, several exact methods for computing such models are proposed to overcome weaknesses of traditional heuristic methods by providing more compact models or better prediction quality.   Despite their compressed representation of Boolean functions, Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) did not gain enough interest as other interpretable ML models. In this paper, we first propose SAT-based models for learning optimal BDDs (in terms of the number of features) that classify all input examples. Then, we lift the encoding to a MaxSAT model to learn optimal BDDs in limited depths, that maximize the number of examples correctly classified. Finally, we tackle the fragmentation problem by introducing a method to merge compatible subtrees for the BDDs found via the MaxSAT model. Our empirical study shows clear benefits of the proposed approach in terms of prediction quality and intrepretability (i.e., lighter size) compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."

So far, a large number of deepfake videos (known as ""deepfakes"") have been crafted and uploaded to the internet, calling for effective countermeasures. One promising countermeasure against deepfakes is deepfake detection. Several deepfake datasets have been released to support the training and testing of deepfake detectors, such as DeepfakeDetection and FaceForensics++. While this has greatly advanced deepfake detection, most of the real videos in these datasets are filmed with a few volunteer actors in limited scenes, and the fake videos are crafted by researchers using a few popular deepfake softwares. Detectors developed on these datasets may become less effective against real-world deepfakes on the internet. To better support detection against real-world deepfakes, in this paper, we introduce a new dataset WildDeepfake, which consists of 7,314 face sequences extracted from 707 deepfake videos collected completely from the internet. WildDeepfake is a small dataset that can be used, in addition to existing datasets, to develop and test the effectiveness of deepfake detectors against real-world deepfakes. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a set of baseline detection networks on both existing and our WildDeepfake datasets, and show that WildDeepfake is indeed a more challenging dataset, where the detection performance can decrease drastically. We also propose two (eg. 2D and 3D) Attention-based Deepfake Detection Networks (ADDNets) to leverage the attention masks on real/fake faces for improved detection. We empirically verify the effectiveness of ADDNets on both existing datasets and WildDeepfake. The dataset is available at:https://github.com/deepfakeinthewild/deepfake-in-the-wild."
590,aaai,2022,Divide-and-Regroup Clustering for Domain Adaptive Person Re-identification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19981,"The superiority of deeply learned pedestrian representations has been reported in very recent literature of person re-identification (re-ID). In this paper, we consider the more pragmatic issue of learning a deep feature with no or only a few labels. We propose a progressive unsupervised learning (PUL) method to transfer pretrained deep representations to unseen domains. Our method is easy to implement and can be viewed as an effective baseline for unsupervised re-ID feature learning. Specifically, PUL iterates between 1) pedestrian clustering and 2) fine-tuning of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve the original model trained on the irrelevant labeled dataset. Since the clustering results can be very noisy, we add a selection operation between the clustering and fine-tuning. At the beginning when the model is weak, CNN is fine-tuned on a small amount of reliable examples which locate near to cluster centroids in the feature space. As the model becomes stronger in subsequent iterations, more images are being adaptively selected as CNN training samples. Progressively, pedestrian clustering and the CNN model are improved simultaneously until algorithm convergence. This process is naturally formulated as self-paced learning. We then point out promising directions that may lead to further improvement. Extensive experiments on three large-scale re-ID datasets demonstrate that PUL outputs discriminative features that improve the re-ID accuracy."
591,aaai,2022,Towards Explainable Action Recognition by Salient Qualitative Spatial Object Relation Chains,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20513,"Salient object detection (SOD) for optical remote sensing images (RSIs) aims at locating and extracting visually distinctive objects/regions from the optical RSIs. Despite some saliency models were proposed to solve the intrinsic problem of optical RSIs (such as complex background and scale-variant objects), the accuracy and completeness are still unsatisfactory. To this end, we propose a relational reasoning network with parallel multi-scale attention for SOD in optical RSIs in this paper. The relational reasoning module that integrates the spatial and the channel dimensions is designed to infer the semantic relationship by utilizing high-level encoder features, thereby promoting the generation of more complete detection results. The parallel multi-scale attention module is proposed to effectively restore the detail information and address the scale variation of salient objects by using the low-level features refined by multi-scale attention. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed RRNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art SOD competitors both qualitatively and quantitatively."
592,aaai,2022,Towards Automating Model Explanations with Certified Robustness Guarantees,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20651,"Adversarial examples pose a security threat to many critical systems built on neural networks (such as face recognition systems, and self-driving cars). While many methods have been proposed to build robust models, how to build certifiably robust yet accurate neural network models remains an open problem. For example, adversarial training improves empirical robustness, but they do not provide certification of the model's robustness. On the other hand, certified training provides certified robustness but at the cost of a significant accuracy drop. In this work, we propose a novel approach that aims to achieve both high accuracy and certified probabilistic robustness. Our method has two parts, i.e., a probabilistic robust training method with an additional goal of minimizing variance in terms of divergence and a runtime inference method for certified probabilistic robustness of the prediction. The latter enables efficient certification of the model's probabilistic robustness at runtime with statistical guarantees. This is supported by our training objective, which minimizes the variance of the model's predictions in a given vicinity, derived from a general definition of model robustness. Our approach works for a variety of perturbations and is reasonably efficient. Our experiments on multiple models trained on different datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both certification rate and accuracy."

To execute a task, an agent needs to visit a pair of goal locations, consisting of a pickup location and a delivery location. We propose two variants of an algorithm that assigns a sequence of tasks to each agent using the anytime algorithm Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) and plans paths using the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm Priority-Based Search (PBS). LNS-PBS is complete for well-formed MAPD instances, a realistic subclass of MAPD instances, and empirically more effective than the existing complete MAPD algorithm CENTRAL. LNS-wPBS provides no completeness guarantee but is empirically more efficient and stable than LNS-PBS. It scales to thousands of agents and thousands of tasks in a large warehouse and is empirically more effective than the existing scalable MAPD algorithm HBH+MLA*. LNS-PBS and LNS-wPBS also apply to a more general variant of MAPD, namely the Multi-Goal MAPD (MG-MAPD) problem, where tasks can have different numbers of goal locations."

We study how to recommend an item at each step to maximize the expected reward while achieving user-side fairness for customers, i.e., customers who share similar profiles will receive a similar reward regardless of their sensitive attributes and items being recommended. By incorporating causal inference into bandits and adopting soft intervention to model the arm selection strategy, we first propose the d-separation based UCB algorithm (D-UCB) to explore the utilization of the d-separation set in reducing the amount of exploration needed to achieve low cumulative regret. Based on that, we then propose the fair causal bandit (F-UCB) for achieving the counterfactual individual fairness. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation demonstrate effectiveness of our algorithms."

While some efforts have been made to detect gentrification in cities, existing approaches rely mainly on estimated measures from survey data, require substantial work of human labeling, and are limited in characterizing the neighborhood as a whole. We propose a novel approach to detecting neighborhood gentrification at a large-scale based on the physical appearance of neighborhoods by incorporating historical street-level visual data. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing results from our approach with gentrification measures from previous literature and case studies. Our approach has the potential to supplement existing indicators of gentrification and become a valid resource for urban researchers and policy makers."
596,aaai,2022,Uncertainty-Aware Learning against Label Noise on Imbalanced Datasets,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20654,"Learning against label noise is a vital topic to guarantee a reliable performance for deep neural networks. Recent research usually refers to dynamic noise modeling with model output probabilities and loss values, and then separates clean and noisy samples. These methods have gained notable success. However, unlike cherry-picked data, existing approaches often cannot perform well when facing imbalanced datasets, a common scenario in the real world. We thoroughly investigate this phenomenon and point out two major issues that hinder the performance, i.e., \emph{inter-class loss distribution discrepancy} and \emph{misleading predictions due to uncertainty}. The first issue is that existing methods often perform class-agnostic noise modeling. However, loss distributions show a significant discrepancy among classes under class imbalance, and class-agnostic noise modeling can easily get confused with noisy samples and samples in minority classes. The second issue refers to that models may output misleading predictions due to epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty, thus existing methods that rely solely on the output probabilities may fail to distinguish confident samples. Inspired by our observations, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Label Correction framework~(ULC) to handle label noise on imbalanced datasets. First, we perform epistemic uncertainty-aware class-specific noise modeling to identify trustworthy clean samples and refine/discard highly confident true/corrupted labels. Then, we introduce aleatoric uncertainty in the subsequent learning process to prevent noise accumulation in the label noise modeling process. We conduct experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially on imbalanced datasets."

Its large reflecting surface achieves unprecedented sensitivity but is prone to damage, such as dents and holes, caused by naturally-occurring falling objects. Hence, the timely and accurate detection of surface defects is crucial for FAST's stable operation. Conventional manual inspection involves human inspectors climbing up and examining the large surface visually, a time-consuming and potentially unreliable process. To accelerate the inspection process and increase its accuracy, this work makes the first step towards automating the inspection of FAST by integrating deep-learning techniques with drone technology. First, a drone flies over the surface along a predetermined route. Since surface defects significantly vary in scale and show high inter-class similarity, directly applying existing deep detectors to detect defects on the drone imagery is highly prone to missing and misidentifying defects. As a remedy, we introduce cross-fusion, a dedicated plug-in operation for deep detectors that enables the adaptive fusion of multi-level features in a point-wise selective fashion, depending on local defect patterns. Consequently, strong semantics and fine-grained details are dynamically fused at different positions to support the accurate detection of defects of various scales and types. Our AI-powered drone-based automated inspection is time-efficient, reliable, and has good accessibility, which guarantees the long-term and stable operation of FAST."

This is challenging, as state-of-the-art methods rely on explicit class semantics obtained from large labeled datasets, and out-of-domain evaluation performance drops significantly. Here we propose a novel approach for mask proposals, Generic Grouping Networks (GGNs), constructed without semantic supervision. Our approach combines a local measure of pixel affinity with instance-level mask supervision, producing a training regimen designed to make the model as generic as the data diversity allows. We introduce a method for predicting Pairwise Affinities (PA), a learned local relationship between pairs of pixels. PA generalizes very well to unseen categories. From PA we construct a large set of pseudo-ground-truth instance masks; combined with human-annotated instance masks we train GGNs and significantly outperform the SOTA on open-world instance segmentation on various benchmarks including COCO, LVIS, ADE20K, and UVO.

We also presented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into DNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity. We present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an equivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a subclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the previous complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this stricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a new operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the assertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF twice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the entailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF under the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the significance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement linear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete belief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories."

These methods usually form a similarity map of RC*C (by compressing spatial dimensions) or RHW*HW (by compressing channels) to describe the feature relations along either channel or spatial dimensions, where C is the number of channels, H and W are the spatial dimensions of the input feature map. However, such practices tend to condense feature dependencies along the other dimensions,hence causing attention missing, which might lead to inferior results for small/thin categories or inconsistent segmentation inside large objects. To address this problem, we propose anew approach, namely Fully Attentional Network (FLANet),to encode both spatial and channel attentions in a single similarity map while maintaining high computational efficiency. Specifically, for each channel map, our FLANet can harvest feature responses from all other channel maps, and the associated spatial positions as well, through a novel fully attentional module. Our new method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on three challenging semantic segmentation datasets,i.e., 83.6%, 46.99%, and 88.5% on the Cityscapes test set,the ADE20K validation set, and the PASCAL VOC test set,respectively."

SOA is one of the best techniques to fulfill these requirements. SOA holds the vantage of being easy to use, flexible, and recyclable. With the advantages, SOA is also endowed with ease for message tampering and unauthorized access. This causes the security technology implementation of E-commerce very difficult at other engineering sciences. This paper discusses the importance of using SOA in E-commerce and identifies the flaws in the existing security analysis of E-commerce platforms. On the foundation of identifying defects, this editorial also suggested an implementation design of the logical security framework for SOA supported E-commerce system."

For example, the grounding process is usually a trivial language-location association without visual reasoning, e.g., grounding any language query containing sheep to the nearly central regions, due to that most queries about sheep have ground-truth locations at the image center. First, we frame the visual grounding pipeline into a causal graph, which shows the causalities among image, query, target location and underlying confounder. Through the causal graph, we know how to break the grounding bottleneck: deconfounded visual grounding. Second, to tackle the challenge that the confounder is unobserved in general, we propose a confounder-agnostic approach called: Referring Expression Deconfounder (RED), to remove the confounding bias. Third, we implement RED as a simple language attention, which can be applied in any grounding method. On popular benchmarks, RED improves various state-of-the-art grounding methods by a significant margin. Code will soon be available at: https://github.com/JianqiangH/Deconfounded_VG."

We exemplify the efficient unsupervised manifold clustering in typical phononic systems, including one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type phononic chain with random couplings, amorphous phononic topological insulators, higher-order phononic topological states and non-Hermitian phononic chain with random dissipations. The results would inspire more efforts on applications of unsupervised machine learning for topological phononic devices and beyond."
604,aaai,2022,CMUA-Watermark: A Cross-Model Universal Adversarial Watermark for Combating Deepfakes,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.19982,"Malicious applications of deepfakes (i.e., technologies generating target facial attributes or entire faces from facial images) have posed a huge threat to individuals' reputation and security. To mitigate these threats, recent studies have proposed adversarial watermarks to combat deepfake models, leading them to generate distorted outputs. Despite achieving impressive results, these adversarial watermarks have low image-level and model-level transferability, meaning that they can protect only one facial image from one specific deepfake model. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution that can generate a Cross-Model Universal Adversarial Watermark (CMUA-Watermark), protecting a large number of facial images from multiple deepfake models. Specifically, we begin by proposing a cross-model universal attack pipeline that attacks multiple deepfake models iteratively. Then, we design a two-level perturbation fusion strategy to alleviate the conflict between the adversarial watermarks generated by different facial images and models. Moreover, we address the key problem in cross-model optimization with a heuristic approach to automatically find the suitable attack step sizes for different models, further weakening the model-level conflict. Finally, we introduce a more reasonable and comprehensive evaluation method to fully test the proposed method and compare it with existing ones. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMUA-Watermark can effectively distort the fake facial images generated by multiple deepfake models while achieving a better performance than existing methods."
605,aaai,2022,A Discriminative and Robust Feature Learning Approach for EEG-Based Motor Imagery Decoding (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21622,"Low-channel EEG devices are crucial for portable and entertainment applications. However, the low spatial resolution of EEG presents challenges in decoding low-channel motor imagery. This study introduces TSFF-Net, a novel network architecture that integrates time-space-frequency features, effectively compensating for the limitations of single-mode feature extraction networks based on time-series or time-frequency modalities. TSFF-Net comprises four main components: time-frequency representation, time-frequency feature extraction, time-space feature extraction, and feature fusion and classification. Time-frequency representation and feature extraction transform raw EEG signals into time-frequency spectrograms and extract relevant features. The time-space network processes time-series EEG trials as input and extracts temporal-spatial features. Feature fusion employs MMD loss to constrain the distribution of time-frequency and time-space features in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, subsequently combining these features using a weighted fusion approach to obtain effective time-space-frequency features. Moreover, few studies have explored the decoding of three-channel motor imagery based on time-frequency spectrograms. This study proposes a shallow, lightweight decoding architecture (TSFF-img) based on time-frequency spectrograms and compares its classification performance in low-channel motor imagery with other methods using two publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that TSFF-Net not only compensates for the shortcomings of single-mode feature extraction networks in EEG decoding, but also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, TSFF-Net offers considerable advantages in decoding low-channel motor imagery and provides valuable insights for algorithmically enhancing low-channel EEG decoding."

Despite its importance, one of the most prevailing limitations in modern day discourse parsing is the lack of large-scale datasets. To overcome the data sparsity issue, distantly supervised approaches from tasks like sentiment analysis and summarization have been recently proposed. Here, we extend this line of research by exploiting distant supervision from topic segmentation, which can arguably provide a strong and oftentimes complementary signal for high-level discourse structures. Experiments on two human-annotated discourse treebanks confirm that our proposal generates accurate tree structures on sentence and paragraph level, consistently outperforming previous distantly supervised models on the sentence-to-document task and occasionally reaching even higher scores on the sentence-to-paragraph level."

To meet this need, this paper defines a Conditional Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (CSTNU) that combines the simple temporal constraints from a Simple Temporal Network (STN) with the conditional nodes from a Conditional Simple Temporal Problem (CSTP) and the contingent links from a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU). A notion of dynamic controllability for a CSTNU is defined that generalizes the dynamic consistency of a CTP and the dynamic controllability of an STNU. The paper also presents some sound constraint-propagation rules for dynamic controllability that are expected to form the backbone of a dynamic-controllability-checking algorithm for CSTNUs."
608,aaai,2022,Understanding Enthymemes in Deductive Argumentation Using Semantic Distance Measures,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20515,"In this paper, we present a preliminary work on an approach to fill the gap between logic-based argumentation and the numerous approaches to tackle the dynamics of abstract argumentation frameworks. Our idea is that, even when arguments and attacks are defined by means of a logical belief base, there may be some uncertainty about how accurate is the content of an argument, and so the presence (or absence) of attacks concerning it. We use enthymemes to illustrate this notion of uncertainty of arguments and attacks. Indeed, as argued in the literature, real arguments are often enthymemes instead of completely specified deductive arguments. This means that some parts of the pair (support, claim) may be missing because they are supposed to belong to some ""common knowledge"", and then should be deduced by the agent which receives the enthymeme. But the perception that agents have of the common knowledge may be wrong, and then a first agent may state an enthymeme that her opponent is not able to decode in an accurate way. It is likely that the decoding of the enthymeme by the agent leads to mistaken attacks between this new argument and the existing ones. In this case, the agent can receive some information about attacks or arguments acceptance statuses which disagree with her argumentation framework. We exemplify a way to incorporate this new piece of information by means of existing works on the dynamics of abstract argumentation frameworks."

However, the small form factor of the wearable devices limits the battery size and operating lifetime. As a result, the devices require frequent recharging, which has limited their widespread adoption. Energy harvesting has emerged as an effective method towards sustainable operation of wearable devices. Unfortunately, energy harvesting alone is not sufficient to fulfill the energy requirements of wearable devices. This paper studies the novel problem of adaptive energy management towards the goal of self-sustainable wearables by using harvested energy to supplement the battery energy and to reduce manual recharging by users. To solve this problem, we propose a principled algorithm referred as AdaEM. There are two key ideas behind AdaEM. First, it uses machine learning (ML) methods to learn predictive models of user activity and energy usage patterns. These models allow us to estimate the potential of energy harvesting in a day as a function of the user activities. Second, it reasons about the uncertainty in predictions and estimations from the ML models to optimize the energy management decisions using a dynamic robust optimization (DyRO) formulation. We propose a light-weight solution for DyRO to meet the practical needs of deployment. We validate the AdaEM approach on a wearable device prototype consisting of solar and motion energy harvesting using real-world data of user activities. Experiments show that AdaEM achieves solutions that are within 5% of the optimal with less than 0.005% execution time and energy overhead."

The dominant approach has been to find a single reward/utility function with the property that alternatives yielding higher rewards are preferred over alternatives yielding lower rewards. However, in many settings, preferences are based on multiple, often competing, objectives; a single reward function is not adequate to represent such preferences. This paper proposes a method for inferring multi-objective reward-based representations of an agent's observed preferences. We model the agent's priorities over different objectives as entering lexicographically, so that objectives with lower priorities matter only when the agent is indifferent with respect to objectives with higher priorities. We offer two example applications in healthcare, one inspired by cancer treatment, the other inspired by organ transplantation, to illustrate how the lexicographically-ordered rewards we learn can provide a better understanding of a decision-maker's preferences and help improve policies when used in reinforcement learning."
611,aaai,2022,Solving PDE-Constrained Control Problems Using Operator Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20373,"In this paper, we develop an online method that leverages machine learning to obtain feasible solutions to the AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem with negligible optimality gaps on extremely fast timescales (e.g., milliseconds), bypassing solving an AC OPF altogether. This is motivated by the fact that as the power grid experiences increasing amounts of renewable power generation, controllable loads, and other inverter-interfaced devices, faster system dynamics and quicker fluctuations in the power supply are likely to occur. Currently, grid operators typically solve AC OPF every 15 minutes to determine economic generator settings while ensuring grid constraints are satisfied. Due to the computational challenges with solving this nonconvex problem, many efforts have focused on linearizing or approximating the problem in order to solve the AC OPF on faster timescales. However, many of these approximations can be fairly poor representations of the actual system state and still require solving an optimization problem, which can be time consuming for large networks. In this work, we leverage historical data to learn a mapping between the system loading and optimal generation values, enabling us to find near-optimal and feasible AC OPF solutions on extremely fast timescales without actually solving an optimization problem."
612,aaai,2022,Using MaxSAT for Efficient Explanations of Tree Ensembles,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20292,"The Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) and Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problems are natural optimization extensions of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT).   In the recent past, different algorithms have been proposed for PBO and for MaxSAT, despite the existence of straightforward mappings from PBO to MaxSAT and vice-versa. This papers proposes Weighted Boolean Optimization (WBO), a new unified framework that aggregates and extends PBO and MaxSAT. In addition, the paper proposes a new unsatisfiability-based algorithm for WBO, based on recent unsatisfiability-based algorithms for MaxSAT. Besides standard MaxSAT, the new algorithm can also be used to solve weighted MaxSAT and PBO, handling pseudo-Boolean constraints either natively or by translation to clausal form. Experimental results illustrate that unsatisfiability-based algorithms for MaxSAT can be orders of magnitude more efficient than existing dedicated algorithms. Finally, the paper illustrates how other algorithms for either PBO or MaxSAT can be extended to WBO."
613,aaai,2022,Approval-Based Committee Voting under Incomplete Information,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20440,"We investigate approval-based committee voting with incomplete information about the approval preferences of voters. We consider several models of incompleteness where each voter partitions the set of candidates into approved, disapproved, and unknown candidates, possibly with ordinal preference constraints among candidates in the latter category. This captures scenarios where voters have not evaluated all candidates and/or it is unknown where voters draw the threshold between approved and disapproved candidates. We study the complexity of some fundamental computational problems for a number of classic approval-based committee voting rules including Proportional Approval Voting and Chamberlin--Courant. These problems include that of determining whether a given set of candidates is a possible or necessary winning committee and whether it forms a committee that possibly or necessarily satisfies representation axioms. We also consider the problem whether a given candidate is possibly or necessarily a member of the winning committee."
614,aaai,2022,On the Practical Robustness of the Nesterov&apos;s Accelerated Quasi-Newton Method,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21579,"We study the trade-offs between convergence rate and robustness to gradient errors in designing a first-order algorithm. We focus on gradient descent (GD) and accelerated gradient (AG) methods for minimizing strongly convex functions when the gradient has random errors in the form of additive white noise. With gradient errors, the function values of the iterates need not converge to the optimal value; hence, we define the robustness of an algorithm to noise as the asymptotic expected suboptimality of the iterate sequence to input noise power. For this robustness measure, we provide exact expressions for the quadratic case using tools from robust control theory and tight upper bounds for the smooth strongly convex case using Lyapunov functions certified through matrix inequalities. We use these characterizations within an optimization problem which selects parameters of each algorithm to achieve a particular trade-off between rate and robustness. Our results show that AG can achieve acceleration while being more robust to random gradient errors. This behavior is quite different than previously reported in the deterministic gradient noise setting. We also establish some connections between the robustness of an algorithm and how quickly it can converge back to the optimal solution if it is perturbed from the optimal point with deterministic noise. Our framework also leads to practical algorithms that can perform better than other state-of-the-art methods in the presence of random gradient noise."

Current convergence results of stochastic momentum methods under non-convex stochastic settings mostly discuss convergence in terms of the random output and minimum output. To this end, we address the convergence of the last iterate output (called last-iterate convergence) of the stochastic momentum methods for non-convex stochastic optimization problems, in a way conformal with traditional optimization theory. We prove the last-iterate convergence of the stochastic momentum methods under a unified framework, covering both stochastic heavy ball momentum and stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient momentum. The momentum factors can be fixed to be constant, rather than time-varying coefficients in existing analyses. Finally, the last-iterate convergence of the stochastic momentum methods is verified on the benchmark MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets."
616,aaai,2022,Globally Optimal Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Linearly-Solvable Markov Decision Processes,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20655,"In this work we present a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning for linearly-solvable Markov decision processes. Our approach assumes that the state space is partitioned, and the subtasks consist in moving between the partitions. We represent value functions on several levels of abstraction, and use the compositionality of subtasks to estimate the optimal values of the states in each partition. The policy is implicitly defined on these optimal value estimates, rather than being decomposed among the subtasks. As a consequence, our approach can learn the globally optimal policy, and does not suffer from the non-stationarity of high-level decisions. If several partitions have equivalent dynamics, the subtasks of those partitions can be shared. If the set of boundary states is smaller than the entire state space, our approach can have significantly smaller sample complexity than that of a flat learner, and we validate this empirically in several experiments."

Despite the fruitful progress, existing methods for both problems are still brittle to the same challenge -- it remains dilemmatic to integrate the common information across modalities (resp. tasks) meanwhile preserving the specific patterns of each modality (resp. task). Besides, while they are actually closely related to each other, multimodal fusion and multitask learning are rarely explored within the same methodological framework before. In this paper, we propose Channel-Exchanging-Network (CEN) which is self-adaptive, parameter-free, and more importantly, applicable for multimodal and multitask dense image prediction. At its core, CEN adaptively exchanges channels between subnetworks of different modalities. Specifically, the channel exchanging process is self-guided by individual channel importance that is measured by the magnitude of Batch-Normalization (BN) scaling factor during training. For the application of dense image prediction, the validity of CEN is tested by four different scenarios: multimodal fusion, cycle multimodal fusion, multitask learning, and multimodal multitask learning. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation via RGB-D data and image translation through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of CEN compared to state-of-the-art methods. Detailed ablation studies have also been carried out, which demonstrate the advantage of each component we propose. Our code is available at https://github.com/yikaiw/CEN."
618,aaai,2022,Reforming an Envy-Free Matching,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20441,"Recently, many matching systems around the world have been reformed. These reforms responded to objections that the matching mechanisms in use were unfair and manipulable. Surprisingly, the mechanisms remained unfair even after the reforms: the new mechanisms may induce an outcome with a blocking student who desires and deserves a school which she did not receive. However, as we show in this paper, the reforms introduced matching mechanisms which are more fair compared to the counterfactuals. First, most of the reforms introduced mechanisms that are more fair by stability: whenever the old mechanism does not have a blocking student, the new mechanism does not have a blocking student either. Second, some reforms introduced mechanisms that are more fair by counting: the old mechanism always has at least as many blocking students as the new mechanism. These findings give a novel rationale to the reforms and complement the recent literature showing that the same reforms have introduced less manipulable matching mechanisms. We further show that the fairness and manipulability of the mechanisms are strongly logically related."

Floor plans in the architectural domain can come from many sources that may or may not be in scalable vector format. The conversion of floor plan images to fully annotated vector images is a process that can now be realized by computer vision. Novel datasets in this field have been used to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for object detection. Image enhancement through Super-Resolution (SR) is also an established CNN based network in computer vision that is used for converting low resolution images to high resolution ones. This work focuses on creating a multi-component module that stacks a SR model on a floor plan object detection model. The proposed stacked model shows greater performance than the corresponding vanilla object detection model. For the best case, the the inclusion of SR showed an improvement of 39.47% in object detection over the vanilla network.

Discovery of the underlying influence network among the dimensions of multi-dimensional temporal processes is of high importance in disciplines where a high-frequency data is to model, e.g. in financial data or in seismological data. This paper approaches the problem of learning Granger-causal network in multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. We formulate this problem as a model selection task in which we follow the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Moreover, we propose a general algorithm for MDL-based inference using a Monte-Carlo method and we use it for our causal discovery problem. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art baseline methods on synthetic and real-world financial data. The synthetic experiments demonstrate superiority of our method incausal graph discovery compared to the baseline methods with respect to the size of the data. The results of experiments with the G-7 bonds price data are consistent with the experts knowledge."

In particular, recently they have proposed the notion of proportionality degree. We study the complexity of computing committees with a given proportionality degree and of testing if a given committee provides a particular one. This way, we complement recent studies that mostly focused on the notion of (extended) justified representation. We also study the problems of testing if a cohesive group of a given size exists and of counting such groups."
622,aaai,2022,AsyncFL: Asynchronous Federated Learning Using Majority Voting with Quantized Model Updates (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21624,"Federated learning is a distributed machine learning mechanism where local devices collaboratively train a shared global model under the orchestration of a central server, while keeping all private data decentralized. In the system, model parameters and its updates are transmitted instead of raw data, and thus the communication bottleneck has become a key challenge. Besides, recent larger and deeper machine learning models also pose more difficulties in deploying them in a federated environment. In this paper, we design a federated two-stage learning framework that augments prototypical federated learning with a cut layer on devices and uses sign-based stochastic gradient descent with the majority vote method on model updates. Cut layer on devices learns informative and low-dimension representations of raw data locally, which helps reduce global model parameters and prevents data leakage. Sign-based SGD with the majority vote method for model updates also helps alleviate communication limitations. Empirically, we show that our system is an efficient and privacy preserving federated learning scheme and suits for general application scenarios."

However, existing conversational agents and datasets do not consider such comprehensive information, and thus they have a limitation in generating the utterances where the knowledge and persona are fused properly. To address this issue, we introduce a call For Customized conversation (FoCus) dataset where the customized answers are built with the user's persona and Wikipedia knowledge. To evaluate the abilities to make informative and customized utterances of pre-trained language models, we utilize BART and GPT-2 as well as transformer-based models. We assess their generation abilities with automatic scores and conduct human evaluations for qualitative results. We examine whether the model reflects adequate persona and knowledge with our proposed two sub-tasks, persona grounding (PG) and knowledge grounding (KG). Moreover, we show that the utterances of our data are constructed with the proper knowledge and persona through grounding quality assessment."

Our predictor has the form of a threshold model, composed of a scoring function and a set of thresholds, and our strategy is based on a reduction to fair binary classification for learning the scoring function and local search for choosing the thresholds. We provide generalization guarantees on the error and fairness violation of our predictor, and we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in extensive experiments."
625,aaai,2022,Towards Discriminant Analysis Classifiers Using Online Active Learning via Myoelectric Interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20658,"In recent decades, biomedical signals have been used for communication in Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI) for medical applications; an instance of these signals are the myoelectric signals (MES), which are generated in the muscles of the human body as unidimensional patterns. Because of this, the methods and algorithms developed for pattern recognition in signals can be applied for their analyses once these signals have been sampled and turned into electromyographic (EMG) signals. Additionally, in recent years, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to studying prosthetic control utilizing EMG signal classification, that is, by logging a set of MES in a proper range of frequencies to classify the corresponding EMG signals. The feature classification can be carried out on the time domain or by using other domains such as the frequency domain (also known as the spectral domain), time scale, and time-frequency, amongst others. One of the main methods used for pattern recognition in myoelectric signals is the Support Vector Machines (SVM) technique whose primary function is to identify an n-dimensional hyperplane to separate a set of input feature points into different classes. This technique has the potential to recognize complex patterns and on several occasions, it has proven its worth when compared to other classifiers such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Principal Component Analysis(PCA). The key concepts underlying the SVM are (a) the hyperplane separator; (b) the kernel function; (c) the optimal separation hyperplane; and (d) a soft margin (hyperplane tolerance)."

However, the benefits of such LARGE models are often limited to a few resource rich languages of the world. In this work, we make multiple contributions towards building ASR systems for low resource languages from the Indian subcontinent. First, we curate 17,000 hours of raw speech data for 40 Indian languages from a wide variety of domains including education, news, technology, and finance. Second, using this raw speech data we pretrain several variants of wav2vec style models for 40 Indian languages. Third, we analyze the pretrained models to find key features: codebook vectors of similar sounding phonemes are shared across languages, representations across layers are discriminative of the language family, and attention heads often pay attention within small local windows. Fourth, we fine-tune this model for downstream ASR for 9 languages and obtain state-of-the-art results on 3 public datasets, including on very low-resource languages such as Sinhala and Nepali. Our work establishes that multilingual pretraining is an effective strategy for building ASR systems for the linguistically diverse speakers of the Indian subcontinent. Our code, data and models are available publicly at https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/indicwav2vec/ and we hope they will help advance research in ASR for Indic languages."

We first discuss the long-term effect of optimizing marketing budget allocation decisions in the offline setting. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel game-theoretic offline value-based reinforcement learning method using mixed policies. The proposed method reduces the need to store infinitely many policies in previous methods to only constantly many policies, which achieves nearly optimal policy efficiency, making it practical and favorable for industrial usage. We further show that this method is guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy, which cannot be achieved by previous value-based reinforcement learning methods for marketing budget allocation. Our experiments on a large-scale marketing campaign with tens-of-millions users and more than one billion budget verify the theoretical results and show that the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods. The proposed method has been successfully deployed to serve all the traffic of this marketing campaign."
628,aaai,2022,Fairness without Imputation: A Decision Tree Approach for Fair Prediction with Missing Values,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21189,"We investigate the fairness concerns of training a machine learning model using data with missing values. Even though there are a number of fairness intervention methods in the literature, most of them require a complete training set as input. In practice, data can have missing values, and data missing patterns can depend on group attributes (e.g. gender or race). Simply applying off-the-shelf fair learning algorithms to an imputed dataset may lead to an unfair model. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze different sources of discrimination risks when training with an imputed dataset. Then, we propose an integrated approach based on decision trees that does not require a separate process of imputation and learning. Instead, we train a tree with missing incorporated as attribute (MIA), which does not require explicit imputation, and we optimize a fairness-regularized objective function. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing fairness intervention methods applied to an imputed dataset, through several experiments on real-world datasets."

Beyond accuracy, diversity has been recognized as a key factor in recommendation to broaden user's horizons as well as to promote enterprises' sales. However, the trading-off between accuracy and diversity remains to be a big challenge, and the data and user biases have not been explored yet.   In this paper, we develop an adaptive learning framework for accurate and diversified recommendation. We generalize recent proposed bi-lateral branch network in the computer vision community from image classification to item recommendation. Specifically, we encode domain level diversity by adaptively balancing accurate recommendation in the conventional branch and diversified recommendation in the adaptive branch of a bilateral branch network. We also capture user level diversity using a two-way adaptive metric learning backbone network in each branch. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines."

As widely used metrics for GANs focus more on the overall performance of the model, evaluation on the quality of individual generations or detection of defective generations is challenging. While recent studies try to detect featuremap units that cause artifacts and evaluate individual samples, these approaches require additional resources such as external networks or a number of training data to approximate the real data manifold. In this work, we propose the concept of local activation, and devise a metric on the local activation to detect artifact generations without additional supervision. We empirically verify that our approach can detect and correct artifact generations from GANs with various datasets. Finally, we discuss a geometrical analysis to partially reveal the relation between the proposed concept and low visual fidelity."

Current detection methods fail against an adversary who adds imperceptible adversarial perturbations to the deepfake to evade detection. In this work, we propose Disjoint Diffusion Deepfake Detection (D4), a deepfake detector designed to improve black-box adversarial robustness beyond de facto solutions such as adversarial training. D4 uses an ensemble of models over disjoint subsets of the frequency spectrum to significantly improve adversarial robustness. Our key insight is to leverage a redundancy in the frequency domain and apply a saliency partitioning technique to disjointly distribute frequency components across multiple models. We formally prove that these disjoint ensembles lead to a reduction in the dimensionality of the input subspace where adversarial deepfakes lie, thereby making adversarial deepfakes harder to find for black-box attacks. We then empirically validate the D4 method against several black-box attacks and find that D4 significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses applied to diffusion-generated deepfake detection. We also demonstrate that D4 provides robustness against adversarial deepfakes from unseen data distributions as well as unseen generative techniques."

A precise traffic volume forecast helps alert drivers to the flow of traffic along their preferred routes, preventing potential deadlock situations. Existing parametric models cannot reliably forecast traffic volume in dynamic and complex traffic conditions. Therefore, in order to evaluate and forecast the traffic volume for every given time step in a real-time manner, we develop non-linear memory-based deep neural network models. Our extensive experiments run on the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in predicting traffic volume in highly dynamic and heterogeneous traffic environments."

Considering that this known a prior is highly variable and unforeseeable regarding the specific scenarios, we show that current methods can actually suffer in generalizing such fitted attributes interdependencies onto scenes or identities off the dataset distribution, resulting in the underlined bias of attributes co-occurrence. To render models robust in realistic scenes, we propose the attributes-disentangled feature learning to ensure the recognition of an attribute not inferring on the existence of others, and which is sequentially formulated as a problem of mutual information minimization. Rooting from it, practical strategies are devised to efficiently decouple attributes, which substantially improve the baseline and establish state-of-the-art performance on realistic datasets like PETAzs and RAPzs.

The key idea of state-of-the-art certified defenses against data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks is to create a majority vote mechanism to predict the label of a testing example. Moreover, each voter is a base classifier trained on a subset of the training dataset. Classical simple learning algorithms such as k nearest neighbors (kNN) and radius nearest neighbors (rNN) have intrinsic majority vote mechanisms. In this work, we show that the intrinsic majority vote mechanisms in kNN and rNN already provide certified robustness guarantees against data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks. Moreover, our evaluation results on MNIST and CIFAR10 show that the intrinsic certified robustness guarantees of kNN and rNN outperform those provided by state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results serve as standard baselines for future certified defenses against data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks."

We argue that the compatible structures between disjoint label sets help model learning and inference. We verify this hypothesis on the task of semantic role labeling (SRL), specifically, tagging a sentence with two role sequences: VerbNet arguments and PropBank arguments. Prior work has shown that cross-task interaction improves performance. However, the two tasks are still separately decoded, running the risk of generating structurally inconsistent label sequences (as per lexicons like SEMLINK). To eliminate this issue, we first propose a simple and effective setup that jointly handles VerbNet and PropBank labels as one sequence. With this setup, we show that enforcing SEMLINK constraints during decoding constantly improves the overall F1. With special input constructions, our joint model infers VerbNet arguments from PropBank arguments with over 99% accuracy. We also propose a constrained marginal model that uses SEMLINK information during training to further benefit from the large amounts of PropBank-only data. Our models achieve state-of-the-art F1's on VerbNet and PropBank argument labeling on the CoNLL05 dataset with strong out-of-domain generalization."
636,aaai,2022,Label Hallucination for Few-Shot Classification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20659,"The recent flourish of deep learning in various tasks is largely accredited to the rich and accessible labeled data. Nonetheless, massive supervision remains a luxury for many real applications, boosting great interest in label-scarce techniques such as few-shot learning (FSL), which aims to learn concept of new classes with a few labeled samples. A natural approach to FSL is data augmentation and many recent works have proved the feasibility by proposing various data synthesis models. However, these models fail to well secure the discriminability and diversity of the synthesized data and thus often produce undesirable results. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Feature Hallucination Networks (AFHN) which is based on conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial networks (cWGAN) and hallucinates diverse and discriminative features conditioned on the few labeled samples. Two novel regularizers, i.e., the classification regularizer and the anti-collapse regularizer, are incorporated into AFHN to encourage discriminability and diversity of the synthesized features, respectively. Ablation study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed cWGAN based feature hallucination framework and the proposed regularizers. Comparative results on three common benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of AFHN to existing data augmentation based FSL approaches and other state-of-the-art ones."

Assuming that the analog voltage generated at the floating diffusion of the photodiode follows a Poisson-Gaussian distribution, the sensor produces either a ``1'' if the voltage is above a certain threshold or ``0'' if it is below the threshold. The concept of this binary sensor has been proposed for more than a decade, and physical devices have been built to realize the concept. However, what benefits does a one-bit QIS offer compared to a conventional multi-bit CMOS image sensor? Besides the known empirical results, are there theoretical proofs to support these findings?   The goal of this paper is to provide new theoretical support from a signal processing perspective. In particular, it is theoretically found that the sensor can offer three benefits: (1) Low-light: One-bit QIS performs better at low-light because it has a low read noise, and its one-bit quantization can produce an error-free measurement. However, this requires the exposure time to be appropriately configured. (2) Frame rate: One-bit sensors can operate at a much higher speed because a response is generated as soon as a photon is detected. However, in the presence of read noise, there exists an optimal frame rate beyond which the performance will degrade. A Closed-form expression of the optimal frame rate is derived. (3) Dynamic range: One-bit QIS offers a higher dynamic range. The benefit is brought by two complementary characteristics of the sensor: nonlinearity and exposure bracketing. The decoupling of the two factors is theoretically proved, and closed-form expressions are derived."

However, most leading systems use only dependency trees. We argue that constituent trees also encode important information, such as explicit span-boundary signals captured by nested multi-word phrases, extra linguistic labels and hierarchical structures useful for detecting anaphora. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective graph-based method to incorporate constituent syntactic structures. Moreover, we also explore to utilise higher-order neighbourhood information to encode rich structures in constituent trees. A novel message propagation mechanism is therefore proposed to enable information flow among elements in syntax trees. Experiments on the English and Chinese portions of OntoNotes 5.0 benchmark show that our proposed model either beats a strong baseline or achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

This paper identifies an important threat to better insurance from these new technologies: data with many fields and few years can yield downward biased estimates of basis risk, a fundamental metric in index insurance. To demonstrate this bias, we use state-of-the-art satellite-based data on agricultural yields in the US and in Kenya to estimate and simulate basis risk. We find a substantive downward bias leading to a systematic overestimation of insurance quality.   In this paper, we argue that big data in crop insurance can lead to a new situation where the number of variables $N$ largely exceeds the number of observations $T$. In such a situation where $T\ll N$, conventional asymptotics break, as evidenced by the large bias we find in simulations. We show how the high-dimension, low-sample-size (HDLSS) asymptotics, together with the spiked covariance model, provide a more relevant framework for the $T\ll N$ case encountered in index insurance. More precisely, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the relative share of the first eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, a measure of systematic risk in index insurance. Our formula accurately approximates the empirical bias simulated from the satellite data, and provides a useful tool for practitioners to quantify bias in insurance quality."

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of generative pre-training in computer programs, yet they are always English-centric. In this work, we step towards bridging the gap between multilingual NLs and multilingual PLs for large language models (LLMs). We release ERNIE-Code, a unified pre-trained language model for 116 NLs and 6 PLs. We employ two methods for universal cross-lingual pre-training: span-corruption language modeling that learns patterns from monolingual NL or PL; and pivot-based translation language modeling that relies on parallel data of many NLs and PLs. Extensive results show that ERNIE-Code outperforms previous multilingual LLMs for PL or NL across a wide range of end tasks of code intelligence, including multilingual code-to-text, text-to-code, code-to-code, and text-to-text generation. We further show its advantage of zero-shot prompting on multilingual code summarization and text-to-text translation. We release our code and pre-trained checkpoints."

A novel decentralized natural policy gradient method, dubbed Momentum-based Decentralized Natural Policy Gradient (MDNPG), is proposed, which incorporates natural gradient, momentum-based variance reduction, and gradient tracking into the decentralized stochastic gradient ascent framework. The $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity for MDNPG to converge to an $\epsilon$-stationary point has been established under standard assumptions, where $n$ is the number of agents. It indicates that MDNPG can achieve the optimal convergence rate for decentralized policy gradient methods and possesses a linear speedup in contrast to centralized optimization methods. Moreover, superior empirical performance of MDNPG over other state-of-the-art algorithms has been demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments."
642,aaai,2022,Delving into Sample Loss Curve to Embrace Noisy and Imbalanced Data,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20661,"Corrupted labels and class imbalance are commonly encountered in practically collected training data, which easily leads to over-fitting of deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a sample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing weighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing only either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with corrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How to handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this paper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar transient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves, which could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by this, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate training strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole biased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each sample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the resulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named CurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper weights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning also blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer meta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom layers. Extensive synthetic and real experiments well validate the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks."
643,aaai,2022,Fast Graph Neural Tangent Kernel via Kronecker Sketching,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20662,"Many deep learning tasks have to deal with graphs (e.g., protein structures, social networks, source code abstract syntax trees). Due to the importance of these tasks, people turned to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the de facto method for learning on graphs. GNNs have become widely applied due to their convincing performance. Unfortunately, one major barrier to using GNNs is that GNNs require substantial time and resources to train. Recently, a new method for learning on graph data is Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) [Du, Hou, Salakhutdinov, Poczos, Wang and Xu 19]. GNTK is an application of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) [Jacot, Gabriel and Hongler 18] (a kernel method) on graph data, and solving NTK regression is equivalent to using gradient descent to train an infinite-wide neural network. The key benefit of using GNTK is that, similar to any kernel method, GNTK's parameters can be solved directly in a single step. This can avoid time-consuming gradient descent. Meanwhile, sketching has become increasingly used in speeding up various optimization problems, including solving kernel regression. Given a kernel matrix of $n$ graphs, using sketching in solving kernel regression can reduce the running time to $o(n^3)$. But unfortunately such methods usually require extensive knowledge about the kernel matrix beforehand, while in the case of GNTK we find that the construction of the kernel matrix is already $O(n^2N^4)$, assuming each graph has $N$ nodes. The kernel matrix construction time can be a major performance bottleneck when the size of graphs $N$ increases. A natural question to ask is thus whether we can speed up the kernel matrix construction to improve GNTK regression's end-to-end running time. This paper provides the first algorithm to construct the kernel matrix in $o(n^2N^3)$ running time."

We generate layouts in three steps. First, we generate the layout elements as nodes in a layout graph. Second, we compute constraints between layout elements as edges in the layout graph. Third, we solve for the final layout using constrained optimization. For the first two steps, we build on recent transformer architectures. The layout optimization implements the constraints efficiently. We show three practical contributions compared to the state of the art: our work requires no user input, produces higher quality layouts, and enables many novel capabilities for conditional layout generation."

In this paper, we exploit group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) to tackle this issue, where we jointly optimize the weights for different groups of distributions and the parameters for the deep model in an interleaved manner during training. We also design a module based on convolutional neural network, which allows the deep model to learn more informative latent pattern among the nodes. We evaluate the proposed approach on two types of well-known deep models including GCN and POMO. The experimental results on the randomly synthesized instances and the ones from two benchmark dataset (i.e., TSPLib and CVRPLib) demonstrate that our approach could significantly improve the cross-distribution generalization performance over the original models."

The feature heterogeneity caused by diverse scanners or protocols introduces a drift in the learning process, in both local (client) and global (server) optimizations, which harms the convergence as well as model performance. Many previous works have attempted to address the non-iid issue by tackling the drift locally or globally, but how to jointly solve the two essentially coupled drifts is still unclear. In this work, we concentrate on handling both local and global drifts and introduce a new harmonizing framework called HarmoFL. First, we propose to mitigate the local update drift by normalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain to mimic a unified imaging setting, in order to generate a harmonized feature space across local clients. Second, based on harmonized features, we design a client weight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum, where a neighborhood area of the local optimal solution has a uniformly low loss. Without any extra communication cost, the perturbation assists the global model to optimize towards a converged optimal solution by aggregating several local flat optima. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically conducted extensive experiments on three medical image classification and segmentation tasks, showing that HarmoFL outperforms a set of recent state-of-the-art methods with promising convergence behavior. Code is available at https://github.com/med-air/HarmoFL."
647,aaai,2022,Learning Expected Emphatic Traces for Deep RL,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20660,"Off-policy sampling and experience replay are key for improving sample efficiency and scaling model-free temporal difference learning methods. When combined with function approximation, such as neural networks, this combination is known as the deadly triad and is potentially unstable. Recently, it has been shown that stability and good performance at scale can be achieved by combining emphatic weightings and multi-step updates. This approach, however, is generally limited to sampling complete trajectories in order, to compute the required emphatic weighting. In this paper we investigate how to combine emphatic weightings with non-sequential, off-line data sampled from a replay buffer. We develop a multi-step emphatic weighting that can be combined with replay, and a time-reversed $n$-step TD learning algorithm to learn the required emphatic weighting. We show that these state weightings reduce variance compared with prior approaches, while providing convergence guarantees. We tested the approach at scale on Atari 2600 video games, and observed that the new X-ETD($n$) agent improved over baseline agents, highlighting both the scalability and broad applicability of our approach."
648,aaai,2022,Evaluating Explainable AI on a Multi-Modal Medical Imaging Task: Can Existing Algorithms Fulfill Clinical Requirements?,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21452,"Being able to explain the prediction to clinical end-users is a necessity to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) models for clinical decision support. For medical images, a feature attribution map, or heatmap, is the most common form of explanation that highlights important features for AI models' prediction. However, it is unknown how well heatmaps perform on explaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each image modality or channel visualizes distinct clinical information of the same underlying biomedical phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically important but technically ignored problem, we propose the modality-specific feature importance (MSFI) metric. It encodes clinical image and explanation interpretation patterns of modality prioritization and modality-specific feature localization. We conduct a clinical requirement-grounded, systematic evaluation using computational methods and a clinician user study. Results show that the examined 16 heatmap algorithms failed to fulfill clinical requirements to correctly indicate AI model decision process or decision quality. The evaluation and MSFI metric can guide the design and selection of XAI algorithms to meet clinical requirements on multi-modal explanation."

Recent research shows that embedding symbolic knowledge into DRL is promising in addressing those challenges. Inspired by this, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning framework with symbolic options. Our framework features a loop training procedure, which enables guiding the improvement of policy by planning with planning models (including action models and hierarchical task network models) and symbolic options learned from interactive trajectories automatically. The learned symbolic options alleviate the dense requirement of expert domain knowledge and provide inherent interpretability of policies. Moreover, the transferability and data efficiency can be further improved by planning with the symbolic planning models. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct experiments on two domains, Montezuma's Revenge and Office World, respectively. The results demonstrate the comparable performance, improved data efficiency, interpretability and transferability."
650,aaai,2022,Hierarchical Context Tagging for Utterance Rewriting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21331,"Utterance rewriting aims to recover coreferences and omitted information from the latest turn of a multi-turn dialogue. Recently, methods that tag rather than linearly generate sequences have proven stronger in both in- and out-of-domain rewriting settings. This is due to a tagger's smaller search space as it can only copy tokens from the dialogue context. However, these methods may suffer from low coverage when phrases that must be added to a source utterance cannot be covered by a single context span. This can occur in languages like English that introduce tokens such as prepositions into the rewrite for grammaticality. We propose a hierarchical context tagger (HCT) that mitigates this issue by predicting slotted rules (e.g., ""besides_"") whose slots are later filled with context spans. HCT (i) tags the source string with token-level edit actions and slotted rules and (ii) fills in the resulting rule slots with spans from the dialogue context. This rule tagging allows HCT to add out-of-context tokens and multiple spans at once; we further cluster the rules to truncate the long tail of the rule distribution. Experiments on several benchmarks show that HCT can outperform state-of-the-art rewriting systems by ~2 BLEU points."

However, social media also enables the widespread of fake news. Because of its detrimental effects brought by social media, fake news detection has attracted increasing attention. However, the performance of detecting fake news only from news content is generally limited as fake news pieces are written to mimic true news. In the real world, news pieces spread through propagation networks on social media. The news propagation networks usually involve multi-levels. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of investigating and exploiting news hierarchical propagation network on social media for fake news detection.   In an attempt to understand the correlations between news propagation networks and fake news, first, we build a hierarchical propagation network from macro-level and micro-level of fake news and true news; second, we perform a comparative analysis of the propagation network features of linguistic, structural and temporal perspectives between fake and real news, which demonstrates the potential of utilizing these features to detect fake news; third, we show the effectiveness of these propagation network features for fake news detection. We further validate the effectiveness of these features from feature important analysis. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of hierarchical propagation network and fake news and paves the way towards a healthier online news ecosystem."

However, high-intensity noise in low-light images amplifies the effect of structure inconsistency between RGB-NIR images, which fails existing algorithms. To handle this, we propose a new RGB-NIR fusion algorithm called Dark Vision Net (DVN) with two technical novelties: Deep Structure and Deep Inconsistency Prior (DIP). The Deep Structure extracts clear structure details in deep multiscale feature space rather than raw input space, which is more robust to noisy inputs. Based on the deep structures from both RGB and NIR domains, we introduce the DIP to leverage the structure inconsistency to guide the fusion of RGB-NIR. Benefiting from this, the proposed DVN obtains high-quality lowlight images without the visual artifacts. We also propose a new dataset called Dark Vision Dataset (DVD), consisting of aligned RGB-NIR image pairs, as the first public RGBNIR fusion benchmark. Quantitative and qualitative results on the proposed benchmark show that DVN significantly outperforms other comparison algorithms in PSNR and SSIM, especially in extremely low light conditions."

However, when targeting the pixel-wise tasks like image fusion, it would not fully perceive the particularity of each pixel in the image if the uniform convolution kernel is used on different patches. In this paper, we propose a local adaptive convolution (LAConv), which is dynamically adjusted to different spatial locations. LAConv enables the network to pay attention to every specific local area in the learning process. Besides, the dynamic bias (DYB) is introduced to provide more possibilities for the depiction of features and make the network more flexible. We further design a residual structure network equipped with the proposed LAConv and DYB modules, and apply it to two image fusion tasks. Experiments for pansharpening and hyperspectral image super-resolution (HISR) demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods. It is worth mentioning that LAConv can also be competent for other super-resolution tasks with less computation effort."

Here, we present a novel module for visual reasoning, the Guided Attention Model for (visual) Reasoning (GAMR), which instantiates an active vision theory -- positing that the brain solves complex visual reasoning problems dynamically -- via sequences of attention shifts to select and route task-relevant visual information into memory. Experiments on an array of visual reasoning tasks and datasets demonstrate GAMR's ability to learn visual routines in a robust and sample-efficient manner. In addition, GAMR is shown to be capable of zero-shot generalization on completely novel reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides computational support for cognitive theories that postulate the need for a critical interplay between attention and memory to dynamically maintain and manipulate task-relevant visual information to solve complex visual reasoning tasks."

A significant challenge is to find a sequential representation that captures the structural/syntactic information in a computer program and facilitates the training of the learning models.   In this paper, we propose to use the Pr\""ufer sequence of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a computer program to design a sequential representation scheme that preserves the structural information in an AST. Our representation makes it possible to develop deep-learning models in which signals carried by lexical tokens in the training examples can be exploited automatically and selectively based on their syntactic role and importance. Unlike other recently-proposed approaches, our representation is concise and lossless in terms of the structural information of the AST. Empirical studies on real-world benchmark datasets, using a sequence-to-sequence learning model we designed for code summarization, show that our Pr\""ufer-sequence-based representation is indeed highly effective and efficient, outperforming significantly all the recently-proposed deep-learning models we used as the baseline models."

A typical system uses huge training samples for learning the correspondence between tables and texts. However, large training sets are expensive to obtain, limiting the applicability of these approaches in real-world scenarios. In this work, we focus on few-shot data-to-text generation. We observe that, while fine-tuned pretrained language models may generate plausible sentences, they suffer from the low semantic coverage problem in the few-shot setting. In other words, important input slots tend to be missing in the generated text. To this end, we propose a search-and-learning approach that leverages pretrained language models but inserts the missing slots to improve the semantic coverage. We further fine-tune our system based on the search results to smooth out the search noise, yielding better-quality text and improving inference efficiency to a large extent. Experiments show that our model achieves high performance on E2E and WikiBio datasets. Especially, we cover 98.35% of input slots on E2E, largely alleviating the low coverage problem."
658,aaai,2022,Adaptive Kernel Graph Neural Network,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i6.20664,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great success in representation learning for graph-structured data. The layer-wise graph convolution in GNNs is shown to be powerful at capturing graph topology. During this process, GNNs are usually guided by pre-defined kernels such as Laplacian matrix, adjacency matrix, or their variants. However, the adoptions of pre-defined kernels may restrain the generalities to different graphs: mismatch between graph and kernel would entail sub-optimal performance. For example, GNNs that focus on low-frequency information may not achieve satisfactory performance when high-frequency information is significant for the graphs, and vice versa. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel framework - i.e., namely Adaptive Kernel Graph Neural Network (AKGNN) - which learns to adapt to the optimal graph kernel in a unified manner at the first attempt. In the proposed AKGNN, we first design a data-driven graph kernel learning mechanism, which adaptively modulates the balance between all-pass and low-pass filters by modifying the maximal eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian. Through this process, AKGNN learns the optimal threshold between high and low frequency signals to relieve the generality problem. Later, we further reduce the number of parameters by a parameterization trick and enhance the expressive power by a global readout function. Extensive experiments are conducted on acknowledged benchmark datasets and promising results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed AKGNN by comparison with state-of-the-art GNNs.

This model can be used to predict future effects of an agent's possible actions. When no such model is available, it is possible to learn an approximation of the real environment, e.g. by using generative neural networks, sometimes also called World Models. As most real-world environments are stochastic in nature and the transition dynamics are oftentimes multimodal, it is important to use a modelling technique that is able to reflect this multimodal uncertainty. In order to safely deploy such learning systems in the real world, especially in an industrial context, it is paramount to consider these uncertainties. In this work, we analyze existing and propose new metrics for the detection and quantification of multimodal uncertainty in RL based World Models. The correct modelling & detection of uncertain future states lays the foundation for handling critical situations in a safe way, which is a prerequisite for deploying RL systems in real-world settings."

In the counter-diabatic driving approach, an auxiliary Hamiltonian which is called the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is appended to an original Hamiltonian to cancel out diabatic transitions. The counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is constructed by using the eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian. Therefore, it is in general difficult to construct the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for quantum many-body systems. Even if the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for quantum many-body systems is obtained, it is generally non-local and even diverges at critical points. We construct an approximated counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for the infinite-range Ising model by making use of the mean-field approximation. An advantage of this method is that the mean-field counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is constructed by only local operators. We numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through quantum annealing processes going the vicinity of the critical point. It is also confirmed that the mean-field counter-diabatic Hamiltonian is still well-defined in the limit to the critical point. The present method can take higher order contributions into account and is consistent with the variational approach for local counter-diabatic driving."

However, these maps have limitations: they lack detail, often contain inaccuracies, and are difficult to create and maintain, especially in an automated fashion. Can we use raw imagery to automatically create better maps that can be easily interpreted by both humans and machines? We introduce SNAP, a deep network that learns rich neural 2D maps from ground-level and overhead images. We train our model to align neural maps estimated from different inputs, supervised only with camera poses over tens of millions of StreetView images. SNAP can resolve the location of challenging image queries beyond the reach of traditional methods, outperforming the state of the art in localization by a large margin. Moreover, our neural maps encode not only geometry and appearance but also high-level semantics, discovered without explicit supervision. This enables effective pre-training for data-efficient semantic scene understanding, with the potential to unlock cost-efficient creation of more detailed maps."
662,aaai,2022,Worst-Case Voting When the Stakes Are High,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20443,"Token Curated Registries (TCR) are decentralized recommendation systems that can be implemented using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to vote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated list. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing token-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a simple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two key dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to evaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct simulations using this model of voters and show that implementing token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our simulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the greatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed token-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this finding using a simplified mathematical analysis."

In the real world, the salient attributes of unlabeled data can be imbalanced. However, most of existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot cluster attributes of these data in their latent spaces properly because they assume uniform distributions of the attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically derive Stein latent optimization that provides reparameterizable gradient estimations of the latent distribution parameters assuming a Gaussian mixture prior in a continuous latent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder network and novel unsupervised conditional contrastive loss to ensure that data generated from a single mixture component represent a single attribute. We confirm that the proposed method, named Stein Latent Optimization for GANs (SLOGAN), successfully learns balanced or imbalanced attributes and achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised conditional generation performance even in the absence of attribute information (e.g., the imbalance ratio). Moreover, we demonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated using a small amount of probe data."

To address these issues, we devise a novel logical reasoner called Braid, that supports probabilistic rules, and uses the notion of custom unification functions and dynamic rule generation to overcome the brittle matching and knowledge-gap problem prevalent in traditional reasoners. In this paper, we describe the reasoning algorithms used in Braid, and their implementation in a distributed task-based framework that builds proof/explanation graphs for an input query. We use a simple QA example from a children's story to motivate Braid's design and explain how the various components work together to produce a coherent logical explanation.

In this study, we build a variational autoencoder (VAE) with SNN to enable image generation. VAE is known for its stability among generative models; recently, its quality advanced. In vanilla VAE, the latent space is represented as a normal distribution, and floating-point calculations are required in sampling. However, this is not possible in SNNs because all features must be binary time series data. Therefore, we constructed the latent space with an autoregressive SNN model, and randomly selected samples from its output to sample the latent variables. This allows the latent variables to follow the Bernoulli process and allows variational learning. Thus, we build the Fully Spiking Variational Autoencoder where all modules are constructed with SNN. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to build a VAE only with SNN layers. We experimented with several datasets, and confirmed that it can generate images with the same or better quality compared to conventional ANNs.

While alternatives such as neuro-symbolic approaches have been proposed, there is a lack of consensus on what they are about. There are often two independent motivations (i) symbols as a lingua franca for human-AI interaction and (ii) symbols as system-produced abstractions used by the AI system in its internal reasoning. The jury is still out on whether AI systems will need to use symbols in their internal reasoning to achieve general intelligence capabilities. Whatever the answer there is, the need for (human-understandable) symbols in human-AI interaction seems quite compelling. Symbols, like emotions, may well not be sine qua non for intelligence per se, but they will be crucial for AI systems to interact with us humans -- as we can neither turn off our emotions nor get by without our symbols. In particular, in many human-designed domains, humans would be interested in providing explicit (symbolic) knowledge and advice -- and expect machine explanations in kind. This alone requires AI systems to to maintain a symbolic interface for interaction with humans. In this blue sky paper, we argue this point of view, and discuss research directions that need to be pursued to allow for this type of human-AI interaction."

In the vanilla MLM, the virtual tokens, [MASK]s, act as placeholders and gather the contextualized information from unmasked tokens to restore the corrupted information. It raises the question of whether we can append [MASK]s at a later layer, to reduce the sequence length for earlier layers and make the pre-training more efficient. We show: (1) [MASK]s can indeed be appended at a later layer, being disentangled from the word embedding; (2) The gathering of contextualized information from unmasked tokens can be conducted with a few layers. By further increasing the masking rate from 15% to 50%, we can pre-train RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large from scratch with only 78% and 68% of the original computational budget without any degradation on the GLUE benchmark. When pre-training with the original budget, our method outperforms RoBERTa for 6 out of 8 GLUE tasks, on average by 0.4%."

However, previous work has indicated that off-the-shelf MLMs are not effective as universal lexical or sentence encoders without further task-specific fine-tuning on NLI, sentence similarity, or paraphrasing tasks using annotated task data. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to turn MLMs into effective universal lexical and sentence encoders even without any additional data and without any supervision. We propose an extremely simple, fast and effective contrastive learning technique, termed Mirror-BERT, which converts MLMs (e.g., BERT and RoBERTa) into such encoders in 20-30 seconds without any additional external knowledge. Mirror-BERT relies on fully identical or slightly modified string pairs as positive (i.e., synonymous) fine-tuning examples, and aims to maximise their similarity during identity fine-tuning. We report huge gains over off-the-shelf MLMs with Mirror-BERT in both lexical-level and sentence-level tasks, across different domains and different languages. Notably, in the standard sentence semantic similarity (STS) tasks, our self-supervised Mirror-BERT model even matches the performance of the task-tuned Sentence-BERT models from prior work. Finally, we delve deeper into the inner workings of MLMs, and suggest some evidence on why this simple approach can yield effective universal lexical and sentence encoders."

The old production classifier in Yahoo Mail was based on a simple logistic regression model. That model was trained by aggregating features at the SMTP address level. We propose building deep learning models at the message level. We built and trained four individual CNN models: (1) a content model with subject and content as input; (2) a sender model with sender email address and name as input; (3) an action model by analyzing email recipients' action patterns and correspondingly generating target labels based on senders' opening/deleting behaviors; (4) a salutation model by utilizing senders' ""explicit salutation"" signal as positive labels. Next, we built a final full model after exploring different combinations of the above four models. Experimental results on editorial data show that our full model improves the adjusted-recall from 70.5% to 78.8% compared to the old production model, while at the same time lifts the precision from 94.7% to 96.0%. Our full model also significantly beats the state-of-the-art Bert model at this task. This full model has been deployed into the current production system (Yahoo Mail 6)."

To get deeper insight of the intrinsic mechanism of GANs, in this paper, a method for interpreting the latent space of GANs by analyzing the correlation between latent variables and the corresponding semantic contents in generated images is proposed. Unlike previous methods that focus on dissecting models via feature visualization, the emphasis of this work is put on the variables in latent space, i.e. how the latent variables affect the quantitative analysis of generated results. Given a pretrained GAN model with weights fixed, the latent variables are intervened to analyze their effect on the semantic content in generated images. A set of controlling latent variables can be derived for specific content generation, and the controllable semantic content manipulation be achieved. The proposed method is testified on the datasets Fashion-MNIST and UT Zappos50K, experiment results show its effectiveness."

Our model exploits the update rates in document representations to dynamically integrate domain encoders. It also employs a probabilistic heuristic to infer the error rate in the target domain in order to pair source classifiers. Our heuristic exploits data transformation cost and the classifier accuracy in the target feature space. We have used real world scenarios of Domain Adaptation to evaluate the efficacy of our algorithm. We also used pretrained multi-layer transformers as the document encoder in the experiments to demonstrate whether the improvement achieved by domain adaptation models can be delivered by out-of-the-box language model pretraining. The experiments testify that our model is the top performing approach in this setting.

However, it is a bit surprising that pure exploration, a basic problem in bandit theory, has not been well studied in MNL-bandit so far.

Many of those implicate profound and sometimes intricate questions of how humans interact or should interact with AIs. Moreover, many users or future users do have abstract ideas of what AI is, significantly depending on the specific embodiment of AI applications. Human-centered-design approaches would suggest evaluating the impact of different embodiments on human perception of and interaction with AI. An approach that is difficult to realize due to the sheer complexity of application fields and embodiments in reality. However, here XR opens new possibilities to research human-AI interactions. The article's contribution is twofold: First, it provides a theoretical treatment and model of human-AI interaction based on an XR-AI continuum as a framework for and a perspective of different approaches of XR-AI combinations. It motivates XR-AI combinations as a method to learn about the effects of prospective human-AI interfaces and shows why the combination of XR and AI fruitfully contributes to a valid and systematic investigation of human-AI interactions and interfaces. Second, the article provides two exemplary experiments investigating the aforementioned approach for two distinct AI-systems. The first experiment reveals an interesting gender effect in human-robot interaction, while the second experiment reveals an Eliza effect of a recommender system. Here the article introduces two paradigmatic implementations of the proposed XR testbed for human-AI interactions and interfaces and shows how a valid and systematic investigation can be conducted. In sum, the article opens new perspectives on how XR benefits human-centered AI design and development."

We have previously presented the first framework that can render ASKAP-sized cubes at interactive frame rates. The framework provides the user with a real-time interactive volume rendering by combining shared and distributed memory architectures, distributed CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs), using the ray-casting algorithm. In this paper we present two main extensions of this framework which are: using a multi-panel display system to provide a high resolution rendering output, and the ability to integrate automated data analysis tools into the visualization output and to interact with its output in place."

The deployment of DNNs in safety-critical domains requires detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data so that DNNs can abstain from making predictions on those. A number of methods have been recently developed for OOD detection, but there is still room for improvement. We propose the new method iDECODe, leveraging in-distribution equivariance for conformal OOD detection. It relies on a novel base non-conformity measure and a new aggregation method, used in the inductive conformal anomaly detection framework, thereby guaranteeing a bounded false detection rate. We demonstrate the efficacy of iDECODe by experiments on image and audio datasets, obtaining state-of-the-art results. We also show that iDECODe can detect adversarial examples."

We model this task as a discrete optimization problem with partial Wasserstein divergence as an objective function. Although this problem is NP-hard, we prove that it satisfies the submodular property, allowing us to use a greedy algorithm with a 0.63 approximation. However, the greedy algorithm is still inefficient because it requires solving linear programming for each objective function evaluation. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose quasi-greedy algorithms that consist of a series of acceleration techniques, such as sensitivity analysis based on strong duality and the so-called C-transform in the optimal transport field. Experimentally, we demonstrate that we can efficiently fill in the gaps between the two datasets and find missing scene in real driving scenes datasets."

Most existing approaches do not explicitly embed the high-order spatio-temporal importance to joints' spatial connection topology and intensity, and they do not have direct objectives on their attention module to jointly learn when and where to focus on in the action sequence. To address these problems, we propose the To-a-T Spatio-Temporal Focus (STF), a skeleton-based action recognition framework that utilizes the spatio-temporal gradient to focus on relevant spatio-temporal features. We first propose the STF modules with learnable gradient-enforced and instance-dependent adjacency matrices to model the high-order spatio-temporal dynamics. Second, we propose three loss terms defined on the gradient-based spatio-temporal focus to explicitly guide the classifier when and where to look at, distinguish confusing classes, and optimize the stacked STF modules. STF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and Kinetics Skeleton 400 datasets in all 15 settings over different views, subjects, setups, and input modalities, and STF also shows better accuracy on scarce data and dataset shifting settings."

In this work, we present a light-weight matting objective decomposition network (MODNet) for portrait matting in real-time with a single input image. The key idea behind our efficient design is by optimizing a series of sub-objectives simultaneously via explicit constraints. In addition, MODNet includes two novel techniques for improving model efficiency and robustness. First, an Efficient Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (e-ASPP) module is introduced to fuse multi-scale features for semantic estimation. Second, a self-supervised sub-objectives consistency (SOC) strategy is proposed to adapt MODNet to real-world data to address the domain shift problem common to trimap-free methods. MODNet is easy to be trained in an end-to-end manner. It is much faster than contemporaneous methods and runs at 67 frames per second on a 1080Ti GPU. Experiments show that MODNet outperforms prior trimap-free methods by a large margin on both Adobe Matting Dataset and a carefully designed photographic portrait matting (PPM-100) benchmark proposed by us. Further, MODNet achieves remarkable results on daily photos and videos. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/ZHKKKe/MODNet, and the PPM-100 benchmark is released at https://github.com/ZHKKKe/PPM."

Prior work in grounded language acquisition has focused primarily on textual inputs. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of performing grounded language acquisition on paired visual percepts and raw speech inputs. This will allow interactions in which language about novel tasks and environments is learned from end users, reducing dependence on textual inputs and potentially mitigating the effects of demographic bias found in widely available speech recognition systems. We leverage recent work in self-supervised speech representation models and show that learned representations of speech can make language grounding systems more inclusive towards specific groups while maintaining or even increasing general performance."

Despite their ability to model general scheduling problems, solving large-scale integer programs (IP) remains a computational challenge in practice. The incorporation of more complex objectives such as robustness to disruptions further exacerbates the computational challenge. We present NICE (Neural network IP Coefficient Extraction), a novel technique that combines reinforcement learning and integer programming to tackle the problem of robust scheduling. More specifically, NICE uses reinforcement learning to approximately represent complex objectives in an integer programming formulation. We use NICE to determine assignments of pilots to a flight crew schedule so as to reduce the impact of disruptions. We compare NICE with (1) a baseline integer programming formulation that produces a feasible crew schedule, and (2) a robust integer programming formulation that explicitly tries to minimize the impact of disruptions. Our experiments show that, across a variety of scenarios, NICE produces schedules resulting in 33% to 48% fewer disruptions than the baseline formulation. Moreover, in more severely constrained scheduling scenarios in which the robust integer program fails to produce a schedule within 90 minutes, NICE is able to build robust schedules in less than 2 seconds on average."

This concept is central towards detection of higher dimensional topological features of data, features to which graphs, encoding only pairwise relationships, remain oblivious. While attempts have been made to extend Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to a simplicial complex setting, the methods do not inherently exploit, or reason about, the underlying topological structure of the network. We propose a graph convolutional model for learning functions parametrized by the $k$-homological features of simplicial complexes. By spectrally manipulating their combinatorial $k$-dimensional Hodge Laplacians, the proposed model enables learning topological features of the underlying simplicial complexes, specifically, the distance of each $k$-simplex from the nearest ""optimal"" $k$-th homology generator, effectively providing an alternative to homology localization."
685,aaai,2022,"Same State, Different Task: Continual Reinforcement Learning without Interference",https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20674,"Continual Learning (CL) considers the problem of training an agent sequentially on a set of tasks while seeking to retain performance on all previous tasks. A key challenge in CL is catastrophic forgetting, which arises when performance on a previously mastered task is reduced when learning a new task. While a variety of methods exist to combat forgetting, in some cases tasks are fundamentally incompatible with each other and thus cannot be learnt by a single policy. This can occur, in reinforcement learning (RL) when an agent may be rewarded for achieving different goals from the same observation. In this paper we formalize this ""interference"" as distinct from the problem of forgetting. We show that existing CL methods based on single neural network predictors with shared replay buffers fail in the presence of interference. Instead, we propose a simple method, OWL, to address this challenge. OWL learns a factorized policy, using shared feature extraction layers, but separate heads, each specializing on a new task. The separate heads in OWL are used to prevent interference. At test time, we formulate policy selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, and show it is possible to select the best policy for an unknown task using feedback from the environment. The use of bandit algorithms allows the OWL agent to constructively re-use different continually learnt policies at different times during an episode. We show in multiple RL environments that existing replay based CL methods fail, while OWL is able to achieve close to optimal performance when training sequentially."
686,aaai,2022,CrossWalk: Fairness-Enhanced Node Representation Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21454,"In this paper, we provide a theory of using graph neural networks (GNNs) for \textit{multi-node representation learning}, where we are interested in learning a representation for a set of more than one node such as a link. Existing GNNs are mainly designed to learn single-node representations. When we want to learn a node-set representation involving multiple nodes, a common practice in previous works is to directly aggregate the single-node representations obtained by a GNN. In this paper, we show a fundamental limitation of such an approach, namely the inability to capture the dependence among multiple nodes in a node set, and argue that directly aggregating individual node representations fails to produce an effective joint representation for multiple nodes. A straightforward solution is to distinguish target nodes from others. Formalizing this idea, we propose \text{labeling trick}, which first labels nodes in the graph according to their relationships with the target node set before applying a GNN and then aggregates node representations obtained in the labeled graph for multi-node representations. The labeling trick also unifies a few previous successful works for multi-node representation learning, including SEAL, Distance Encoding, ID-GNN, and NBFNet. Besides node sets in graphs, we also extend labeling tricks to posets, subsets and hypergraphs. Experiments verify that the labeling trick technique can boost GNNs on various tasks, including undirected link prediction, directed link prediction, hyperedge prediction, and subgraph prediction. Our work explains the superior performance of previous node-labeling-based methods and establishes a theoretical foundation for using GNNs for multi-node representation learning."

While generally reliable, state-of-the-art MIP solvers base many crucial decisions on hand-crafted heuristics, largely ignoring common patterns within a given instance distribution of the problem of interest. Here, we propose MIP-GNN, a general framework for enhancing such solvers with data-driven insights. By encoding the variable-constraint interactions of a given mixed-integer linear program (MILP) as a bipartite graph, we leverage state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures to predict variable biases, i.e., component-wise averages of (near) optimal solutions, indicating how likely a variable will be set to 0 or 1 in (near) optimal solutions of binary MILPs. In turn, the predicted biases stemming from a single, once-trained model are used to guide the solver, replacing heuristic components. We integrate MIP-GNN into a state-of-the-art MIP solver, applying it to tasks such as node selection and warm-starting, showing significant improvements compared to the default setting of the solver on two classes of challenging binary MILPs."

Constructing datasets of pre-computed backdoors for widely used MIP benchmark sets or particular problem families can enable new questions around novel structural properties of a MIP, or explain why a problem that is hard in theory can be solved efficiently in practice. Existing algorithms for finding backdoors rely on sampling candidate variable subsets in various ways, an approach which has demonstrated the existence of backdoors for some instances from MIPLIB2003 and MIPLIB2010. However, these algorithms fall short of consistently succeeding at the task due to an imbalance between exploration and exploitation. We propose BaMCTS, a Monte Carlo Tree Search framework for finding backdoors to MIPs. Extensive algorithmic engineering, hybridization with traditional MIP concepts, and close integration with the CPLEX solver have enabled our method to outperform baselines on MIPLIB2017 instances, finding backdoors more frequently and more efficiently."

Recent work has shown that adversarial perturbations typically contain high-frequency features, but the root cause of this phenomenon remains unknown. Inspired by theoretical work on linear full-width convolutional models, we hypothesize that the local (i.e. bounded-width) convolutional operations commonly used in current neural networks are implicitly biased to learn high frequency features, and that this is one of the root causes of high frequency adversarial examples. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the impact of different choices of linear and nonlinear architectures on the implicit bias of the learned features and the adversarial perturbations, in both spatial and frequency domains. We find that the high-frequency adversarial perturbations are critically dependent on the convolution operation because the spatially-limited nature of local convolutions induces an implicit bias towards high frequency features. The explanation for the latter involves the Fourier Uncertainty Principle: a spatially-limited (local in the space domain) filter cannot also be frequency-limited (local in the frequency domain). Furthermore, using larger convolution kernel sizes or avoiding convolutions (e.g. by using Vision Transformers architecture) significantly reduces this high frequency bias, but not the overall susceptibility to attacks. Looking forward, our work strongly suggests that understanding and controlling the implicit bias of architectures will be essential for achieving adversarial robustness."
690,aaai,2022,The Effect of Manifold Entanglement and Intrinsic Dimensionality on Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20676,"There is an increasing interest in the problem of nonparametric regression like Gaussian processes with predictors locating on manifold. Some recent researches developed intrinsic Gaussian processes by using the transition density of the Brownian motion on submanifolds of $\mathbb R^2$ and $\mathbb R^3$ to approximate the heat kernels. {However}, when the dimension of a manifold is bigger than two, the existing method struggled to get good estimation of the heat kernel. In this work, we propose an intrinsic approach of constructing the Gaussian process on \if more \fi general manifolds \if {\color{red} in the matrix Lie groups} \fi such as orthogonal groups, unitary groups, Stiefel manifolds and Grassmannian manifolds. The heat kernel is estimated by simulating Brownian motion sample paths via the exponential map, which does not depend on the embedding of the manifold. To be more precise, this intrinsic method has the following features: (i) it is effective for high dimensional manifolds; (ii) it is applicable to arbitrary manifolds; (iii) it does not require the global parametrisation or embedding which may introduce redundant parameters; (iv) results obtained by this method do not depend on the ambient space of the manifold. Based on this method, we propose the ball algorithm for arbitrary manifolds and the strip algorithm for manifolds with extra symmetries, which is both theoretically proven and numerically tested to be much more efficient than the ball algorithm. A regression example on the projective space of dimension eight is given in this work, which demonstrates that our intrinsic method for Gaussian process is practically effective in great generality."

Evolution of initially biased tracers using perturbation theory (PT) generates multivariate bias parameters as soon as nonlinear fluctuations become important. We present a procedure that reparametrize a set of spectral parameters, the arguments of the Fourier transformed Lagrangian bias function, from which multivariate renormalized biases can be derived at any order in bias expansion and PT. We find our method simpler than previous renormalization schemes because it only relies on the definition of bias, fixed from the beginning, and in one equation relating renormalized and unrenormalized spectral parameters. We also show that our multivariate biases can be obtained within the peak background split framework, in that sense this work extends that of Schmidt, Jeong and Desjacques (2013); however, we restrict our method to Gaussian initial conditions. Non-linear evolution also leads to the appearance of products of correlators evaluated at the same point, commonly named contact terms, yielding divergent contributions to the power spectrum, in this work we present an explicit method to remove these divergences by introducing stochastic fields."

Hence, it fails to address the domain shift between base and novel classes in few-shot learning.

We consider weights as hyper-parameters and iteratively optimize them using a small set of validation tasks set in a nested bi-level optimization approach (in contrast to the standard bi-level optimization in MAML). We then apply NestedMAML in the meta-training stage, which involves (1) several tasks sampled from a distribution different from the meta-test task distribution, or (2) some data samples with noisy labels. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NestedMAML efficiently mitigates the effects of ""unwanted"" tasks or instances, leading to significant improvement over the state-of-the-art robust meta-learning methods."

Few efforts have been made to compare existing unsupervised time-series anomaly detection methods rigorously. However, only standard performance metrics, namely precision, recall, and F1-score are usually considered. Essential aspects for assessing their practical relevance are therefore neglected. This paper proposes an original and in-depth evaluation study of recent unsupervised anomaly detection techniques in time-series. Instead of relying solely on standard performance metrics, additional yet informative metrics and protocols are taken into account. In particular, (1) more elaborate performance metrics specifically tailored for time-series are used; (2) the model size and the model stability are studied; (3) an analysis of the tested approaches with respect to the anomaly type is provided; and (4) a clear and unique protocol is followed for all experiments. Overall, this extensive analysis aims to assess the maturity of state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection, give insights regarding their applicability under real-world setups and provide to the community a more complete evaluation protocol."
694,aaai,2022,Proxy Learning of Visual Concepts of Fine Art Paintings from Styles through Language Models,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20374,"We present a machine learning system that can quantify fine art paintings with a set of visual elements and principles of art. This formal analysis is fundamental for understanding art, but developing such a system is challenging. Paintings have high visual complexities, but it is also difficult to collect enough training data with direct labels. To resolve these practical limitations, we introduce a novel mechanism, called proxy learning, which learns visual concepts in paintings though their general relation to styles. This framework does not require any visual annotation, but only uses style labels and a general relationship between visual concepts and style. In this paper, we propose a novel proxy model and reformulate four pre-existing methods in the context of proxy learning. Through quantitative and qualitative comparison, we evaluate these methods and compare their effectiveness in quantifying the artistic visual concepts, where the general relationship is estimated by language models; GloVe or BERT. The language modeling is a practical and scalable solution requiring no labeling, but it is inevitably imperfect. We demonstrate how the new proxy model is robust to the imperfection, while the other models are sensitively affected by it."
695,aaai,2022,CAISE: Conversational Agent for Image Search and Editing,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21337,"Demand for image editing has been increasing as users' desire for expression is also increasing. However, for most users, image editing tools are not easy to use since the tools require certain expertise in photo effects and have complex interfaces. Hence, users might need someone to help edit their images, but having a personal dedicated human assistant for every user is impossible to scale. For that reason, an automated assistant system for image editing is desirable. Additionally, users want more image sources for diverse image editing works, and integrating an image search functionality into the editing tool is a potential remedy for this demand. Thus, we propose a dataset of an automated Conversational Agent for Image Search and Editing (CAISE). To our knowledge, this is the first dataset that provides conversational image search and editing annotations, where the agent holds a grounded conversation with users and helps them to search and edit images according to their requests. To build such a system, we first collect image search and editing conversations between pairs of annotators. The assistant-annotators are equipped with a customized image search and editing tool to address the requests from the user-annotators. The functions that the assistant-annotators conduct with the tool are recorded as executable commands, allowing the trained system to be useful for real-world application execution. We also introduce a generator-extractor baseline model for this task, which can adaptively select the source of the next token (i.e., from the vocabulary or from textual/visual contexts) for the executable command. This serves as a strong starting point while still leaving a large human-machine performance gap for useful future work. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/hyounghk/CAISE"
696,aaai,2022,Fast Monte-Carlo Approximation of the Attention Mechanism,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20679,"Autoregressive Transformers are strong language models but incur O(T) complexity during per-token generation due to the self-attention mechanism. Recent work proposes kernel-based methods to approximate causal self-attention by replacing it with recurrent formulations with various update rules and feature maps to achieve O(1) time and memory complexity. We explore these approaches and find that they are unnecessarily complex, and propose a simple alternative - decaying fast weights - that runs fast on GPU, outperforms prior methods, and retains 99% of attention's performance for GPT-2. We also show competitive performance on WikiText-103 against more complex attention substitutes."
697,aaai,2022,Deep Translation Prior: Test-Time Training for Photorealistic Style Transfer,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.20004,"Recent techniques to solve photorealistic style transfer within deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generally require intensive training from large-scale datasets, thus having limited applicability and poor generalization ability to unseen images or styles. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework, dubbed Deep Translation Prior (DTP), to accomplish photorealistic style transfer through test-time training on given input image pair with untrained networks, which learns an image pair-specific translation prior and thus yields better performance and generalization. Tailored for such test-time training for style transfer, we present novel network architectures, with two sub-modules of correspondence and generation modules, and loss functions consisting of contrastive content, style, and cycle consistency losses. Our framework does not require offline training phase for style transfer, which has been one of the main challenges in existing methods, but the networks are to be solely learned during test-time. Experimental results prove that our framework has a better generalization ability to unseen image pairs and even outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
698,aaai,2022,Dual Task Framework for Improving Persona-Grounded Dialogue Dataset,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21338,"This paper introduces a simple yet effective data-centric approach for the task of improving persona-conditioned dialogue agents. Prior model-centric approaches unquestioningly depend on the raw crowdsourced benchmark datasets such as Persona-Chat. In contrast, we aim to fix annotation artifacts in benchmarking, which is orthogonally applicable to any dialogue model. Specifically, we augment relevant personas to improve dialogue dataset/agent, by leveraging the primal-dual structure of the two tasks, predicting dialogue responses and personas based on each other. Experiments on Persona-Chat show that our approach outperforms pre-trained LMs by an 11.7 point gain in terms of accuracy."
699,aaai,2022,Tracking Down Misguiding Terms for Locating Bugs in Deep Learning-Based Software (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21628,"Bug datasets are vital for enabling deep learning techniques to address software maintenance tasks related to bugs. However, existing bug datasets suffer from precise and scale limitations: they are either small-scale but precise with manual validation or large-scale but imprecise with simple commit message processing. In this paper, we introduce PreciseBugCollector, a precise, multi-language bug collection approach that overcomes these two limitations. PreciseBugCollector is based on two novel components: a) A bug tracker to map the codebase repositories with external bug repositories to trace bug type information, and b) A bug injector to generate project-specific bugs by injecting noise into the correct codebases and then executing them against their test suites to obtain test failure messages.   We implement PreciseBugCollector against three sources: 1) A bug tracker that links to the national vulnerability data set (NVD) to collect general-wise vulnerabilities, 2) A bug tracker that links to OSS-Fuzz to collect general-wise bugs, and 3) A bug injector based on 16 injection rules to generate project-wise bugs. To date, PreciseBugCollector comprises 1057818 bugs extracted from 2968 open-source projects. Of these, 12602 bugs are sourced from bug repositories (NVD and OSS-Fuzz), while the remaining 1045216 project-specific bugs are generated by the bug injector. Considering the challenge objectives, we argue that a bug injection approach is highly valuable for the industrial setting, since project-specific bugs align with domain knowledge, share the same codebase, and adhere to the coding style employed in industrial projects."
700,aaai,2022,Robust Tests in Online Decision-Making,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21240,"Online decision-making problem requires us to make a sequence of decisions based on incremental information. Common solutions often need to learn a reward model of different actions given the contextual information and then maximize the long-term reward. It is meaningful to know if the posited model is reasonable and how the model performs in the asymptotic sense. We study this problem under the setup of the contextual bandit framework with a linear reward model. The $\varepsilon$-greedy policy is adopted to address the classic exploration-and-exploitation dilemma. Using the martingale central limit theorem, we show that the online ordinary least squares estimator of model parameters is asymptotically normal. When the linear model is misspecified, we propose the online weighted least squares estimator using the inverse propensity score weighting and also establish its asymptotic normality. Based on the properties of the parameter estimators, we further show that the in-sample inverse propensity weighted value estimator is asymptotically normal. We illustrate our results using simulations and an application to a news article recommendation dataset from Yahoo!."

Unfortunately, disentanglement has been shown to be impossible without the incorporation of supervision or inductive bias. Given that supervision is often expensive or infeasible to acquire, we choose to incorporate structural inductive bias and present an unsupervised, deep State-Space-Model for Video Disentanglement (VDSM). The model disentangles latent time-varying and dynamic factors via the incorporation of hierarchical structure with a dynamic prior and a Mixture of Experts decoder. VDSM learns separate disentangled representations for the identity of the object or person in the video, and for the action being performed. We evaluate VDSM across a range of qualitative and quantitative tasks including identity and dynamics transfer, sequence generation, Fr\'echet Inception Distance, and factor classification. VDSM provides state-of-the-art performance and exceeds adversarial methods, even when the methods use additional supervision."
702,aaai,2022,FedCC: Federated Learning with Consensus Confirmation for Byzantine Attack Resistance (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21627,"This paper considers the problem of detection in distributed networks in the presence of data falsification (Byzantine) attacks. Detection approaches considered in the paper are based on fully distributed consensus algorithms, where all of the nodes exchange information only with their neighbors in the absence of a fusion center. In such networks, we characterize the negative effect of Byzantines on the steady-state and transient detection performance of the conventional consensus based detection algorithms. To address this issue, we study the problem from the network designer's perspective. More specifically, we first propose a distributed weighted average consensus algorithm that is robust to Byzantine attacks. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, the global test statistic for detection can be computed locally at each node using our proposed consensus algorithm. We exploit the statistical distribution of the nodes' data to devise techniques for mitigating the influence of data falsifying Byzantines on the distributed detection system. Since some parameters of the statistical distribution of the nodes' data might not be known a priori, we propose learning based techniques to enable an adaptive design of the local fusion or update rules."
703,aaai,2022,COVID-EENet: Predicting Fine-Grained Impact of COVID-19 on Local Economies,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21455,"The current pandemic has introduced substantial uncertainty to traditional methods for demand planning. These uncertainties stem from the disease progression, government interventions, economy and consumer behavior. While most of the emerging literature on the pandemic has focused on disease progression, a few have focused on consequent regulations and their impact on individual behavior. The contributions of this paper include a quantitative behavior model of fear of COVID-19, impact of government interventions on consumer behavior, and impact of consumer behavior on consumer choice and hence demand for goods. It brings together multiple models for disease progression, consumer behavior and demand estimation-thus bridging the gap between disease progression and consumer demand. We use panel regression to understand the drivers of demand during the pandemic and Bayesian inference to simplify the regulation landscape that can help build scenarios for resilient demand planning. We illustrate this resilient demand planning model using a specific example of gas retailing. We find that demand is sensitive to fear of COVID-19: as the number of COVID-19 cases increase over the previous week, the demand for gas decreases -- though this dissipates over time. Further, government regulations restrict access to different services, thereby reducing mobility, which in itself reduces demand."
704,aaai,2022,NaturalInversion: Data-Free Image Synthesis Improving Real-World Consistency,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.20006,"Recent advances in deep learning led to novel generative modeling techniques that achieve unprecedented quality in generated samples and performance in learning complex distributions in imaging data. These new models in medical image computing have important applications that form clinically relevant and very challenging unsupervised learning problems. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using state-of-the-art auto-encoder-based deep generative models, such as variational and adversarial auto-encoders, for one such task: abnormality detection in medical imaging. We utilize typical, publicly available datasets with brain scans from healthy subjects and patients with stroke lesions and brain tumors. We use the data from healthy subjects to train different auto-encoder based models to learn the distribution of healthy images and detect pathologies as outliers. Models that can better learn the data distribution should be able to detect outliers more accurately. We evaluate the detection performance of deep generative models and compare them with non-deep learning based approaches to provide a benchmark of the current state of research. We conclude that abnormality detection is a challenging task for deep generative models and large room exists for improvement. In order to facilitate further research, we aim to provide carefully pre-processed imaging data available to the research community."
705,aaai,2022,Towards Versatile Pedestrian Detector with Multisensory-Matching and Multispectral Recalling Memory,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.20001,"Multimodal information (e.g., visible and thermal) can generate robust pedestrian detections to facilitate around-the-clock computer vision applications, such as autonomous driving and video surveillance. However, it still remains a crucial challenge to train a reliable detector working well in different multispectral pedestrian datasets without manual annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework for multispectral pedestrian detection, by iteratively generating pseudo annotations and updating the parameters of our designed multispectral pedestrian detector on target domain. Pseudo annotations are generated using the detector trained on source domain, and then updated by fixing the parameters of detector and minimizing the cross entropy loss without back-propagation. Training labels are generated using the pseudo annotations by considering the characteristics of similarity and complementarity between well-aligned visible and infrared image pairs. The parameters of detector are updated using the generated labels by minimizing our defined multi-detection loss function with back-propagation. The optimal parameters of detector can be obtained after iteratively updating the pseudo annotations and parameters. Experimental results show that our proposed unsupervised multimodal domain adaptation method achieves significantly higher detection performance than the approach without domain adaptation, and is competitive with the supervised multispectral pedestrian detectors."
706,aaai,2022,A Machine Learning Method for EV Range Prediction with Updates on Route Information and Traffic Conditions,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21525,"Route Choice Models predict the route choices of travelers traversing an urban area. Most of the route choice models link route characteristics of alternative routes to those chosen by the drivers. The models play an important role in prediction of traffic levels on different routes and thus assist in development of efficient traffic management strategies that result in minimizing traffic delay and maximizing effective utilization of transport system. High fidelity route choice models are required to predict traffic levels with higher accuracy. Existing route choice models do not take into account dynamic contextual conditions such as the occurrence of an accident, the socio-cultural and economic background of drivers, other human behaviors, the dynamic personal risk level, etc. As a result, they can only make predictions at an aggregate level and for a fixed set of contextual factors. For higher fidelity, it is highly desirable to use a model that captures significance of subjective or contextual factors in route choice. This paper presents a novel approach for developing high-fidelity route choice models with increased predictive power by augmenting existing aggregate level baseline models with information on drivers' responses to contextual factors obtained from Stated Choice Experiments carried out in an Immersive Virtual Environment through the use of knowledge distillation."
707,aaai,2022,Semantic Feature Extraction for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.20002,"Recently, many zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods focused on learning discriminative object features in an embedding feature space, however, the distributions of the unseen-class features learned by these methods are prone to be partly overlapped, resulting in inaccurate object recognition. Addressing this problem, we propose a novel adversarial network to synthesize compact semantic visual features for ZSL, consisting of a residual generator, a prototype predictor, and a discriminator. The residual generator is to generate the visual feature residual, which is integrated with a visual prototype predicted via the prototype predictor for synthesizing the visual feature. The discriminator is to distinguish the synthetic visual features from the real ones extracted from an existing categorization CNN. Since the generated residuals are generally numerically much smaller than the distances among all the prototypes, the distributions of the unseen-class features synthesized by the proposed network are less overlapped. In addition, considering that the visual features from categorization CNNs are generally inconsistent with their semantic features, a simple feature selection strategy is introduced for extracting more compact semantic visual features. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method could achieve a significantly better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods by 1.2-13.2% in most cases."
708,aaai,2022,Meta-Learning for Online Update of Recommender Systems,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20324,"Online recommender systems should be always aligned with users' current interest to accurately suggest items that each user would like. Since user interest usually evolves over time, the update strategy should be flexible to quickly catch users' current interest from continuously generated new user-item interactions. Existing update strategies focus either on the importance of each user-item interaction or the learning rate for each recommender parameter, but such one-directional flexibility is insufficient to adapt to varying relationships between interactions and parameters. In this paper, we propose MeLON, a meta-learning based novel online recommender update strategy that supports two-directional flexibility. It is featured with an adaptive learning rate for each parameter-interaction pair for inducing a recommender to quickly learn users' up-to-date interest. The procedure of MeLON is optimized following a meta-learning approach: it learns how a recommender learns to generate the optimal learning rates for future updates. Specifically, MeLON first enriches the meaning of each interaction based on previous interactions and identifies the role of each parameter for the interaction; and then combines these two pieces of information to generate an adaptive learning rate. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluation on three real-world online recommender datasets validate the effectiveness of MeLON."
709,aaai,2022,PrivateSNN: Privacy-Preserving Spiking Neural Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.20005,"This article studies the expressive power of spiking neural networks where information is encoded in the firing time of neurons. The implementation of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware presents a promising choice for future energy-efficient AI applications. However, there exist very few results that compare the computational power of spiking neurons to arbitrary threshold circuits and sigmoidal neurons. Additionally, it has also been shown that a network of spiking neurons is capable of approximating any continuous function. By using the Spike Response Model as a mathematical model of a spiking neuron and assuming a linear response function, we prove that the mapping generated by a network of spiking neurons is continuous piecewise linear. We also show that a spiking neural network can emulate the output of any multi-layer (ReLU) neural network. Furthermore, we show that the maximum number of linear regions generated by a spiking neuron scales exponentially with respect to the input dimension, a characteristic that distinguishes it significantly from an artificial (ReLU) neuron. Our results further extend the understanding of the approximation properties of spiking neural networks and open up new avenues where spiking neural networks can be deployed instead of artificial neural networks without any performance loss."
710,aaai,2022,ALP: Data Augmentation Using Lexicalized PCFGs for Few-Shot Text Classification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21336,"Data augmentation has been an important ingredient for boosting performances of learned models. Prior data augmentation methods for few-shot text classification have led to great performance boosts. However, they have not been designed to capture the intricate compositional structure of natural language. As a result, they fail to generate samples with plausible and diverse sentence structures. Motivated by this, we present the data Augmentation using Lexicalized Probabilistic context-free grammars (ALP) that generates augmented samples with diverse syntactic structures with plausible grammar. The lexicalized PCFG parse trees consider both the constituents and dependencies to produce a syntactic frame that maximizes a variety of word choices in a syntactically preservable manner without specific domain experts. Experiments on few-shot text classification tasks demonstrate that ALP enhances many state-of-the-art classification methods. As a second contribution, we delve into the train-val splitting methodologies when a data augmentation method comes into play. We argue empirically that the traditional splitting of training and validation sets is sub-optimal compared to our novel augmentation-based splitting strategies that further expand the training split with the same number of labeled data. Taken together, our contributions on the data augmentation strategies yield a strong training recipe for few-shot text classification tasks."
711,aaai,2022,Distinguishing Homophenes Using Multi-Head Visual-Audio Memory for Lip Reading,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i1.20003,"Recognizing speech from silent lip movement, which is called lip reading, is a challenging task due to 1) the inherent information insufficiency of lip movement to fully represent the speech, and 2) the existence of homophenes that have similar lip movement with different pronunciations. In this paper, we try to alleviate the aforementioned two challenges in lip reading by proposing a Multi-head Visual-audio Memory (MVM). Firstly, MVM is trained with audio-visual datasets and remembers audio representations by modelling the inter-relationships of paired audio-visual representations. At the inference stage, visual input alone can extract the saved audio representation from the memory by examining the learned inter-relationships. Therefore, the lip reading model can complement the insufficient visual information with the extracted audio representations. Secondly, MVM is composed of multi-head key memories for saving visual features and one value memory for saving audio knowledge, which is designed to distinguish the homophenes. With the multi-head key memories, MVM extracts possible candidate audio features from the memory, which allows the lip reading model to consider the possibility of which pronunciations can be represented from the input lip movement. This also can be viewed as an explicit implementation of the one-to-many mapping of viseme-to-phoneme. Moreover, MVM is employed in multi-temporal levels to consider the context when retrieving the memory and distinguish the homophenes. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in lip reading and in distinguishing the homophenes."
712,aaai,2022,Introducing Symmetries to Black Box Meta Reinforcement Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20681,"Meta reinforcement learning (RL) attempts to discover new RL algorithms automatically from environment interaction. In so-called black-box approaches, the policy and the learning algorithm are jointly represented by a single neural network. These methods are very flexible, but they tend to underperform in terms of generalisation to new, unseen environments. In this paper, we explore the role of symmetries in meta-generalisation. We show that a recent successful meta RL approach that meta-learns an objective for backpropagation-based learning exhibits certain symmetries (specifically the reuse of the learning rule, and invariance to input and output permutations) that are not present in typical black-box meta RL systems. We hypothesise that these symmetries can play an important role in meta-generalisation. Building off recent work in black-box supervised meta learning, we develop a black-box meta RL system that exhibits these same symmetries. We show through careful experimentation that incorporating these symmetries can lead to algorithms with a greater ability to generalise to unseen action & observation spaces, tasks, and environments."

A automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline search is performed by means of a genetic optimization to reduce human induced bias due to inappropriate parameterizations. For this purpose, a search space is defined, which includes general methods of signal processing and manipulation as well as methods tailored to the respective task and domain. The proposed framework is evaluated on the bearing fault detection use case under real world conditions. Considerations on the generalization of the deployed fault detection pipelines are also taken into account. Likewise, attention was paid to experimental studies for evaluations of the robustness of the fault detection pipeline to variations of the motors working condition parameters between the training and test domain. The present work contributes to the research of fault detection on rotating machinery in the following terms: (1) Reduction of the human induced bias to the data science process, while still considering expert and task related knowledge, ending in a generic search approach (2) tackling the bearing fault detection task without the need for external sensors (sensorless) (3) learning a domain robust fault detection pipeline applicable to varying motor operating parameters without the need of re-parameterizations or fine-tuning (4) investigations on working condition discrepancies with an excessive degree to determine the pipeline limitations regarding the abstraction of the motor parameters and the pipeline hyperparameters"

However, relatively little research has focused on leveraging deep learning to enhance our understanding of ribozymes. This study implements Word2Vec, an unsupervised learning technique for natural language processing, to learn ribozyme embeddings. Ribo2Vec was trained on over 9,000 diverse ribozymes, learning to map sequences to 128 and 256-dimensional vector spaces. Using Ribo2Vec, sequence embeddings for five classes of ribozymes (hatchet, pistol, hairpin, hovlinc, and twister sister) were calculated. Principal component analysis demonstrated the ability of these embeddings to distinguish between ribozyme classes. Furthermore, a simple SVM classifier trained on ribozyme embeddings showed promising results in accurately classifying ribozyme types. Our results suggest that the embedding vectors contained meaningful information about ribozymes. Interestingly, 256-dimensional embeddings behaved similarly to 128-dimensional embeddings, suggesting that a lower dimension vector space is generally sufficient to capture ribozyme features. This approach demonstrates the potential of Word2Vec for bioinformatics, opening new avenues for ribozyme research. Future research includes using a Transformer-based method to learn RNA embeddings, which can capture long-range interactions between nucleotides."

In this paper, two methods for animacy identification are proposed and evaluated using intrinsic and extrinsic measures. The first method is a rule-based one which uses information about the unique beginners in WordNet to classify NPs on the basis of their animacy. The second method relies on a machine learning algorithm which exploits a WordNet enriched with animacy information for each sense. The effect of word sense disambiguation on the two methods is also assessed. The intrinsic evaluation reveals that the machine learning method reaches human levels of performance. The extrinsic evaluation demonstrates that animacy identification can be beneficial in anaphora resolution, especially in the cases where animate entities are identified with high precision."
716,aaai,2022,Planning to Avoid Side Effects,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21219,"Reduced models of large Markov decision processes accelerate planning by considering a subset of outcomes for each state-action pair. This reduction in reachable states leads to replanning when the agent encounters states without a precomputed action during plan execution. However, not all states are suitable for replanning. In the worst case, the agent may not be able to reach the goal from the newly encountered state. Agents should be better prepared to handle such risky situations and avoid replanning in risky states. Hence, we consider replanning in states that are unsafe for deliberation as a negative side effect of planning with reduced models. While the negative side effects can be minimized by always using the full model, this defeats the purpose of using reduced models. The challenge is to plan with reduced models, but somehow account for the possibility of encountering risky situations. An agent should thus only replan in states that the user has approved as safe for replanning. To that end, we propose planning using a portfolio of reduced models, a planning paradigm that minimizes the negative side effects of planning using reduced models by alternating between different outcome selection approaches. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three domains: an electric vehicle charging domain using real-world data from a university campus and two benchmark planning problems."

Generative models of these data are of particular interest, as they enable a range of impactful downstream applications like simulation or creating synthetic training data. Recent work has highlighted the potential of generative adversarial nets (GANs) for generating spatio-temporal data. A new GAN algorithm COT-GAN, inspired by the theory of causal optimal transport (COT), was proposed in an attempt to better tackle this challenge. However, the task of learning more complex spatio-temporal patterns requires additional knowledge of their specific data structures. In this study, we propose a novel loss objective combined with COT-GAN based on an autoregressive embedding to reinforce the learning of spatio-temporal dynamics. We devise SPATE (spatio-temporal association), a new metric measuring spatio-temporal autocorrelation by using the deviance of observations from their expected values. We compute SPATE for real and synthetic data samples and use it to compute an embedding loss that considers space-time interactions, nudging the GAN to learn outputs that are faithful to the observed dynamics. We test this new objective on a diverse set of complex spatio-temporal patterns: turbulent flows, log-Gaussian Cox processes and global weather data. We show that our novel embedding loss improves performance without any changes to the architecture of the COT-GAN backbone, highlighting our model's increased capacity for capturing autoregressive structures. We also contextualize our work with respect to recent advances in physics-informed deep learning and interdisciplinary work connecting neural networks with geographic and geophysical sciences."

Here, we are given a social network, a seed-set of agents for each opinion, and two thresholds for each agent. The first threshold represents the willingness of an agent to adopt an opinion if the agent has no opinion at all, while the second threshold states for willingness to acquire second opinion. The goal is to add as few agents as possible to the initial seed-sets such that, once the process started with these seed-sets stabilizes, each agent has either both opinions or none.   We show that the problem is NP-hard. Further, we investigate the complexity from the parameterized point-of-view. The problem is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size. The problem remains W[1]-hard even for the combination of parameters the solution size and treewidth of the network even if all thresholds are at most 3, or the activation process stabilizes within 4 rounds. On the other hand, the problem is FPT when parameterized by the number of rounds, maximum threshold, and treewidth. This algorithm applies also for combined parameter treedepth and maximum threshold. Finally, we show that the problem is FPT when parameterized by vertex cover number of the input network alone. Our results also imply that the original Target Set Selection problem is FPT when parameterized by 3-PVC."

Pre-trained language transformer models such as BERT are therefore hard to use in this scenario due to their high computational demands. We present our real-time approach to the document ranking problem leveraging a BERT-based siamese architecture. The model is already deployed in a commercial search engine and it improves production performance by more than 3%. For further research and evaluation, we release DaReCzech, a unique data set of 1.6 million Czech user query-document pairs with manually assigned relevance levels. We also release Small-E-Czech, an Electra-small language model pre-trained on a large Czech corpus. We believe this data will support endeavours both of search relevance and multilingual-focused research communities."

The proposed method, referred to as 3D DetecTrack, enables the detector and tracker to cooperate to generate a spatio-temporal representation of the camera and LiDAR data, with which 3D object detection and tracking are then performed. The detector constructs the spatio-temporal features via the weighted temporal aggregation of the spatial features obtained by the camera and LiDAR fusion. Then, the detector reconfigures the initial detection results using information from the tracklets maintained up to the previous time step. Based on the spatio-temporal features generated by the detector, the tracker associates the detected objects with previously tracked objects using a graph neural network (GNN). We devise a fully-connected GNN facilitated by a combination of rule-based edge pruning and attention-based edge gating, which exploits both spatial and temporal object contexts to improve tracking performance. The experiments conducted on both KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed 3D DetecTrack achieves significant improvements in both detection and tracking performances over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing methods through collaboration between the detector and tracker."

(Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21631,"We consider the problem of positive-semidefinite continuation: extending a partially specified covariance kernel from a subdomain $\Omega$ of a rectangular domain $I\times I$ to a covariance kernel on the entire domain $I\times I$. For a broad class of domains $\Omega$ called \emph{serrated domains}, we are able to present a complete theory. Namely, we demonstrate that a canonical completion always exists and can be explicitly constructed. We characterise all possible completions as suitable perturbations of the canonical completion, and determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a unique completion to exist. We interpret the canonical completion via the graphical model structure it induces on the associated Gaussian process. Furthermore, we show how the estimation of the canonical completion reduces to the solution of a system of linear statistical inverse problems in the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators, and derive rates of convergence. We conclude by providing extensions of our theory to more general forms of domains, and by demonstrating how our results can be used to construct covariance estimators from sample path fragments of the associated stochastic process. Our results are illustrated numerically by way of a simulation study and a real example."

With the rapid development of online platforms for generating and distributing text-rich documents, there arises an urgent need for continuously summarizing dynamically evolving multi-document sets where the composition of documents and sets is changing over time. This is especially challenging as the summarization should be not only effective in incorporating relevant, novel, and distinctive information from each concurrent multi-document set, but also efficient in serving online applications. In this work, we propose a new summarization problem, Evolving Multi-Document sets stream Summarization (EMDS), and introduce a novel unsupervised algorithm PDSum with the idea of prototype-driven continuous summarization. PDSum builds a lightweight prototype of each multi-document set and exploits it to adapt to new documents while preserving accumulated knowledge from previous documents. To update new summaries, the most representative sentences for each multi-document set are extracted by measuring their similarities to the prototypes. A thorough evaluation with real multi-document sets streams demonstrates that PDSum outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised multi-document summarization algorithms in EMDS in terms of relevance, novelty, and distinctiveness and is also robust to various evaluation settings."

The task of a phase retrieval algorithm is typically to recover a signal from linear phaseless measurements. In this paper, we approach the problem by proposing a hybrid model-based data-driven deep architecture, referred to as Unfolded Phase Retrieval (UPR), that exhibits significant potential in improving the performance of state-of-the art data-driven and model-based phase retrieval algorithms. The proposed method benefits from versatility and interpretability of well-established model-based algorithms, while simultaneously benefiting from the expressive power of deep neural networks. In particular, our proposed model-based deep architecture is applied to the conventional phase retrieval problem (via the incremental reshaped Wirtinger flow algorithm) and the sparse phase retrieval problem (via the sparse truncated amplitude flow algorithm), showing immense promise in both cases. Furthermore, we consider a joint design of the sensing matrix and the signal processing algorithm and utilize the deep unfolding technique in the process. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of such hybrid model-based and data-driven frameworks and showcase the untapped potential of data-aided methodologies to enhance the existing phase retrieval algorithms."

Yet the knowledge we have on decision boundary geometry and the loss landscape of neural policies is still quite limited. In this paper we propose a framework to investigate the decision boundary and loss landscape similarities across states and across MDPs. We conduct experiments in various games from Arcade Learning Environment, and discover that high sensitivity directions for neural policies are correlated across MDPs. We argue that these high sensitivity directions support the hypothesis that non-robust features are shared across training environments of reinforcement learning agents. We believe our results reveal fundamental properties of the environments used in deep reinforcement learning training, and represent a tangible step towards building robust and reliable deep reinforcement learning agents."

It models the optimal scheduling of multiple sequences of tasks, each under a fixed order of operations, in which individual tasks require exclusive access to a predetermined resource for a specified processing time. The problem is NP-hard and computationally challenging even for medium-sized instances. Motivated by the increased stochasticity in production chains, this paper explores a deep learning approach to deliver efficient and accurate approximations to the JSP. In particular, this paper proposes the design of a deep neural network architecture to exploit the problem structure, its integration with Lagrangian duality to capture the problem constraints, and a post-processing optimization to guarantee solution feasibility.The resulting method, called JSP-DNN, is evaluated on hard JSP instances from the JSPLIB benchmark library. Computational results show that JSP-DNN can produce JSP approximations of high quality at negligible computational costs."

It is often necessary to guide the subset selection to achieve certain desiderata, which includes focusing or targeting certain data points, while avoiding others. Examples of such problems include: i)targeted learning, where the goal is to find subsets with rare classes or rare attributes on which the model is underperforming, and ii)guided summarization, where data (e.g., image collection, text, document or video) is summarized for quicker human consumption with specific additional user intent. Motivated by such applications, we present PRISM, a rich class of PaRameterIzed Submodular information Measures. Through novel functions and their parameterizations, PRISM offers a variety of modeling capabilities that enable a trade-off between desired qualities of a subset like diversity or representation and similarity/dissimilarity with a set of data points. We demonstrate how PRISM can be applied to the two real-world problems mentioned above, which require guided subset selection. In doing so, we show that PRISM interestingly generalizes some past work, therein reinforcing its broad utility. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of PRISM over the state-of-the-art in targeted learning and in guided image-collection summarization"
728,aaai,2022,Split Moves for Monte-Carlo Tree Search,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21265,"In many games, moves consist of several decisions made by the player. These decisions can be viewed as separate moves, which is already a common practice in multi-action games for efficiency reasons. Such division of a player move into a sequence of simpler / lower level moves is called \emph{splitting}. So far, split moves have been applied only in forementioned straightforward cases, and furthermore, there was almost no study revealing its impact on agents' playing strength. Taking the knowledge-free perspective, we aim to answer how to effectively use split moves within Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and what is the practical impact of split design on agents' strength. This paper proposes a generalization of MCTS that works with arbitrarily split moves. We design several variations of the algorithm and try to measure the impact of split moves separately on efficiency, quality of MCTS, simulations, and action-based heuristics. The tests are carried out on a set of board games and performed using the Regular Boardgames General Game Playing formalism, where split strategies of different granularity can be automatically derived based on an abstract description of the game. The results give an overview of the behavior of agents using split design in different ways. We conclude that split design can be greatly beneficial for single- as well as multi-action games."

This may be due to the conflicting ways through which distinct Artificial Intelligence (AI) research tracks conceive of their interface with social contexts. In this paper we track the historical emergence of sociotechnical inquiry in three distinct subfields of AI research: AI Safety, Fair Machine Learning (Fair ML) and Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) Autonomy. We show that for each subfield, perceptions of PIT stem from the particular dangers faced by past integration of technical systems within a normative social order. We further interrogate how these histories dictate the response of each subfield to conceptual traps, as defined in the Science and Technology Studies literature. Finally, through a comparative analysis of these currently siloed fields, we present a roadmap for a unified approach to sociotechnical graduate pedagogy in AI."
730,aaai,2022,Learning Robust Policy against Disturbance in Transition Dynamics via State-Conservative Policy Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20686,"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms can perform poorly in real-world tasks due to the discrepancy between source and target environments. This discrepancy is commonly viewed as the disturbance in transition dynamics. Many existing algorithms learn robust policies by modeling the disturbance and applying it to source environments during training, which usually requires prior knowledge about the disturbance and control of simulators. However, these algorithms can fail in scenarios where the disturbance from target environments is unknown or is intractable to model in simulators. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel model-free actor-critic algorithm -- namely, state-conservative policy optimization (SCPO) -- to learn robust policies without modeling the disturbance in advance. Specifically, SCPO reduces the disturbance in transition dynamics to that in state space and then approximates it by a simple gradient-based regularizer. The appealing features of SCPO include that it is simple to implement and does not require additional knowledge about the disturbance or specially designed simulators. Experiments in several robot control tasks demonstrate that SCPO learns robust policies against the disturbance in transition dynamics."

They can be used to assess the role of a backlink for the popularity of a website as well as the importance of a flight in virus spreading. Various node centralities have been translated to apply for edges, including Edge Betweenness, Eigenedge (edge version of Eigenvector centrality) and Edge PageRank. With this paper, we initiate the discussion on the axiomatic properties of edge centrality measures. We do it by proposing an axiomatic characterization of Edge PageRank. Our characterization is the first characterization of any edge centrality measure in the literature."

Instead, here we investigate fairness from the perspective of recourse actions suggested to individuals to remedy an unfavourable classification. We propose two new fairness criteria at the group and individual level, which -- unlike prior work on equalising the average group-wise distance from the decision boundary -- explicitly account for causal relationships between features, thereby capturing downstream effects of recourse actions performed in the physical world. We explore how our criteria relate to others, such as counterfactual fairness, and show that fairness of recourse is complementary to fairness of prediction. We study theoretically and empirically how to enforce fair causal recourse by altering the classifier and perform a case study on the Adult dataset. Finally, we discuss whether fairness violations in the data generating process revealed by our criteria may be better addressed by societal interventions as opposed to constraints on the classifier."

We show that detracting syntactic and semantic information from word embeddings and running NMT systems with random embeddings is not as damaging as it initially sounds. We also show how incorporating only a limited amount of task-specific knowledge from fully-trained embeddings can boost the performance NMT systems. Our findings demonstrate that in exchange for negligible deterioration in performance, any NMT model can be run with partially random embeddings. Working with such structures means a minimal memory requirement as there is no longer need to store large embedding tables, which is a significant gain in industrial and on-device settings. We evaluated our embeddings in translating {English} into {German} and {French} and achieved a $5.3$x compression rate. Despite having a considerably smaller architecture, our models in some cases are even able to outperform state-of-the-art baselines."
734,aaai,2022,Amplitude Spectrum Transformation for Open Compound Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20008,"Open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) has emerged as a practical adaptation setting which considers a single labeled source domain against a compound of multi-modal unlabeled target data in order to generalize better on novel unseen domains. We hypothesize that an improved disentanglement of domain-related and task-related factors of dense intermediate layer features can greatly aid OCDA. Prior-arts attempt this indirectly by employing adversarial domain discriminators on the spatial CNN output. However, we find that latent features derived from the Fourier-based amplitude spectrum of deep CNN features hold a more tractable mapping with domain discrimination. Motivated by this, we propose a novel feature space Amplitude Spectrum Transformation (AST). During adaptation, we employ the AST auto-encoder for two purposes. First, carefully mined source-target instance pairs undergo a simulation of cross-domain feature stylization (AST-Sim) at a particular layer by altering the AST-latent. Second, AST operating at a later layer is tasked to normalize (AST-Norm) the domain content by fixing its latent to a mean prototype. Our simplified adaptation technique is not only clustering-free but also free from complex adversarial alignment. We achieve leading performance against the prior arts on the OCDA scene segmentation benchmarks."

While many deterministic learning algorithms have been designed based on numerical integration via the adjoint method, many downstream tasks such as active learning, exploration in reinforcement learning, robust control, or filtering require accurate estimates of predictive uncertainties. In this work, we propose a novel approach towards estimating epistemically uncertain neural ODEs, avoiding the numerical integration bottleneck. Instead of modeling uncertainty in the ODE parameters, we directly model uncertainties in the state space. Our algorithm - distributional gradient matching (DGM) - jointly trains a smoother and a dynamics model and matches their gradients via minimizing a Wasserstein loss. Our experiments show that, compared to traditional approximate inference methods based on numerical integration, our approach is faster to train, faster at predicting previously unseen trajectories, and in the context of neural ODEs, significantly more accurate."

Previous research on UWB positioning system has achieved up to mm or sub-mm accuracy. However, one bottleneck in UWB system is at sampling high resolution UWB signals, as well as high resolution timing information. In this paper, UWB positioning systems are surveyed and we focus on sampling methods for handling UWB signals. Among different sampling methods, one traditional way is the sequential sampling method, which is not a real time sampling method and blocks UWB positioning system to achieve higher precision. Another way is by applying Compressed Sensing (CS) to UWB system for achieving sub-mm positioning accuracy. In this paper, we compare different TDOA-based UWB systems with different sampling methods. In particular, several CS-UWB algorithms for UWB signal reconstruction are compared in terms of positioning accuracy. Simulation results in 2D and 3D experiments demonstrate performance of different algorithms including typical BCS, OMP and BP algorithms. CS-UWB is also compared with UWB positioning system based on the sequential sampling method."

To this end, we give a brief overview of knowledge distillation and some related works including learning using privileged information(LUPI) and generalized distillation(GD). Even though knowledge distillation based on the teacher-student architecture was initially devised as a model compression technique, it has found versatile applications over various frameworks.   In this paper, we review the characteristics of knowledge distillation from the hypothesis that the three important ingredients of knowledge distillation are distilled knowledge and loss,teacher-student paradigm, and the distillation process. In addition, we survey the versatility of the knowledge distillation by studying its direct applications and its usage in combination with other deep learning paradigms. Finally we present some future works in knowledge distillation including explainable knowledge distillation where the analytical analysis of the performance gain is studied and the self-supervised learning which is a hot research topic in deep learning community."

While existing work shows promising results in image classification, probability calibration has not been much explored for personalized ranking. In this paper, we aim to estimate the calibrated probability of how likely a user will prefer an item. We investigate various parametric distributions and propose two parametric calibration methods, namely Gaussian calibration and Gamma calibration. Each proposed method can be seen as a post-processing function that maps the ranking scores of pre-trained models to well-calibrated preference probabilities, without affecting the recommendation performance. We also design the unbiased empirical risk minimization framework that guides the calibration methods to learning of true preference probability from the biased user-item interaction dataset. Extensive evaluations with various personalized ranking models on real-world datasets show that both the proposed calibration methods and the unbiased empirical risk minimization significantly improve the calibration performance."

Recent works have shown the power of deep reinforcement learning techniques to learn socially cooperative policies. However, their cooperation ability deteriorates as the crowd grows since they typically relax the problem as a one-way Human-Robot interaction problem. In this work, we want to go beyond first-order Human-Robot interaction and more explicitly model Crowd-Robot Interaction (CRI). We propose to (i) rethink pairwise interactions with a self-attention mechanism, and (ii) jointly model Human-Robot as well as Human-Human interactions in the deep reinforcement learning framework. Our model captures the Human-Human interactions occurring in dense crowds that indirectly affects the robot's anticipation capability. Our proposed attentive pooling mechanism learns the collective importance of neighboring humans with respect to their future states. Various experiments demonstrate that our model can anticipate human dynamics and navigate in crowds with time efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

We construct and release an expert-annotated corpus of texts sampled from full-length papers, labeled with novel semantic categories that generalize across many types of challenges and directions. We focus on a large corpus of interdisciplinary work relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from biomedicine to areas such as AI and economics.

This is made possible by two key components: a novel algorithm, which we call automatic domain randomization (ADR) and a robot platform built for machine learning. ADR automatically generates a distribution over randomized environments of ever-increasing difficulty. Control policies and vision state estimators trained with ADR exhibit vastly improved sim2real transfer. For control policies, memory-augmented models trained on an ADR-generated distribution of environments show clear signs of emergent meta-learning at test time. The combination of ADR with our custom robot platform allows us to solve a Rubik's cube with a humanoid robot hand, which involves both control and state estimation problems.

742,aaai,2022,Siamese Network with Interactive Transformer for Video Object Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20009,"Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) refers to segmenting the target object in remaining frames given its annotation in the first frame, which has been actively studied in recent years. The key challenge lies in finding effective ways to exploit the spatio-temporal context of past frames to help learn discriminative target representation of current frame. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese network with a specifically designed interactive transformer, called SITVOS, to enable effective context propagation from historical to current frames. Technically, we use the transformer encoder and decoder to handle the past frames and current frame separately, i.e., the encoder encodes robust spatio-temporal context of target object from the past frames, while the decoder takes the feature embedding of current frame as the query to retrieve the target from the encoder output. To further enhance the target representation, a feature interaction module (FIM) is devised to promote the information flow between the encoder and decoder. Moreover, we employ the Siamese architecture to extract backbone features of both past and current frames, which enables feature reuse and is more efficient than existing methods. Experimental results on three challenging benchmarks validate the superiority of SITVOS over state-of-the-art methods."

Widely used Linear Programming (LP) relaxations only work well when networks are trained to facilitate verification. This precludes applications that involve verification-agnostic networks, i.e., networks not specially trained for verification. On the other hand, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have successfully be applied to verification-agnostic networks, but do not currently scale beyond small networks due to poor time and space asymptotics. In this work, we propose a first-order dual SDP algorithm that (1) requires memory only linear in the total number of network activations, (2) only requires a fixed number of forward/backward passes through the network per iteration. By exploiting iterative eigenvector methods, we express all solver operations in terms of forward and backward passes through the network, enabling efficient use of hardware like GPUs/TPUs. For two verification-agnostic networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10, we significantly improve L-inf verified robust accuracy from 1% to 88% and 6% to 40% respectively. We also demonstrate tight verification of a quadratic stability specification for the decoder of a variational autoencoder."

Over the last few years, there are a growing number of datasets and deep learning-based methods proposed for effectively solving MWPs. However, most existing methods are benchmarked soly on one or two datasets, varying in different configurations, which leads to a lack of unified, standardized, fair, and comprehensive comparison between methods. This paper presents MWPToolkit, the first open-source framework for solving MWPs. In MWPToolkit, we decompose the procedure of existing MWP solvers into multiple core components and decouple their models into highly reusable modules. We also provide a hyper-parameter search function to boost the performance. In total, we implement and compare 17 MWP solvers on 4 widely-used single equation generation benchmarks and 2 multiple equations generation benchmarks. These features enable our MWPToolkit to be suitable for researchers to reproduce advanced baseline models and develop new MWP solvers quickly.

745,aaai,2022,Learning Adversarial Markov Decision Processes with Delayed Feedback,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20690,"Reinforcement learning typically assumes that agents observe feedback for their actions immediately, but in many real-world applications (like recommendation systems) feedback is observed in delay. This paper studies online learning in episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unknown transitions, adversarially changing costs and unrestricted delayed feedback. That is, the costs and trajectory of episode $k$ are revealed to the learner only in the end of episode $k + d^k$, where the delays $d^k$ are neither identical nor bounded, and are chosen by an oblivious adversary. We present novel algorithms based on policy optimization that achieve near-optimal high-probability regret of $\sqrt{K + D}$ under full-information feedback, where $K$ is the number of episodes and $D = \sum_{k} d^k$ is the total delay. Under bandit feedback, we prove similar $\sqrt{K + D}$ regret assuming the costs are stochastic, and $(K + D)^{2/3}$ regret in the general case. We are the first to consider regret minimization in the important setting of MDPs with delayed feedback."

At the same time, many behaviors are highly adaptive and can be tailored to specific environments by means of learning. In this work, we use mathematical analysis and the framework of meta-learning (or 'learning to learn') to answer when it is beneficial to learn such an adaptive strategy and when to hard-code a heuristic behavior. We find that the interplay of ecological uncertainty, task complexity and the agents' lifetime has crucial effects on the meta-learned amortized Bayesian inference performed by an agent. There exist two regimes: One in which meta-learning yields a learning algorithm that implements task-dependent information-integration and a second regime in which meta-learning imprints a heuristic or 'hard-coded' behavior. Further analysis reveals that non-adaptive behaviors are not only optimal for aspects of the environment that are stable across individuals, but also in situations where an adaptation to the environment would in fact be highly beneficial, but could not be done quickly enough to be exploited within the remaining lifetime. Hard-coded behaviors should hence not only be those that always work, but also those that are too complex to be learned within a reasonable time frame."

As in every network, the architecture setting as well as the learning method are two main gauntlets faced by BBFNN. In this paper, new architecture and training algorithm are proposed for the BBFNN. An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used as a training approach of BBFNN with the aim of quickening the training process. The peculiarity of ELM is permitting a certain decrement of the computing time and complexity regarding the already used BBFNN learning algorithms such as backpropagation, OLS, etc. For the architectural design, a recurrent structure is added to the common BBFNN architecture in order to make it more able to deal with complex, non linear and time varying problems. Throughout this paper, the conceived recurrent ELM-trained BBFNN is tested on a number of tasks related to time series prediction, classification and regression. Experimental results show noticeable achievements of the proposed network compared to common feedforward and recurrent networks trained by ELM and using hyperbolic tangent as activation function. These achievements are in terms of accuracy and robustness against data breakdowns such as noise signals."

Deep neural network (DNN) based image steganography and watermarking techniques are quickly replacing traditional hand-engineered pipelines. DNN based watermarking techniques have drastically improved the message capacity, imperceptibility and robustness of the embedded watermarks. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational overhead of the watermark encoder neural network. In this work, we design the first accelerator platform FastStamp to perform DNN based steganography and digital watermarking of images on hardware. We first propose a parameter efficient DNN model for embedding recoverable bit-strings in image pixels. Our proposed model can match the success metrics of prior state-of-the-art DNN based watermarking methods while being significantly faster and lighter in terms of memory footprint. We then design an FPGA based accelerator framework to further improve the model throughput and power consumption by leveraging data parallelism and customized computation paths. FastStamp allows embedding hardware signatures into images to establish media authenticity and ownership of digital media. Our best design achieves 68 times faster inference as compared to GPU implementations of prior DNN based watermark encoder while consuming less power."

There exist frameworks addressing constrained optimization, for instance, CVXPY and GENO. However, in contrast to deep learning frameworks, GPU support is limited. Here, we extend the GENO framework to also solve constrained optimization problems on the GPU. The framework allows the user to specify constrained optimization problems in an easy-to-read modeling language. A solver is then automatically generated from this specification. When run on the GPU, the solver outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like CVXPY combined with a GPU-accelerated solver such as cuOSQP or SCS by a few orders of magnitude."

However, despite its use as a tool for subgroup discovery and description - few state-of-the-art algorithms provide any rationale or description behind the clusters found. We propose a novel approach for interpretable clustering that both clusters data points and constructs polytopes around the discovered clusters to explain them. Our framework allows for additional constraints on the polytopes - including ensuring that the hyperplanes constructing the polytope are axis-parallel or sparse with integer coefficients. We formulate the problem of constructing clusters via polytopes as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP). To solve our formulation we propose a two phase approach where we first initialize clusters and polytopes using alternating minimization, and then use coordinate descent to boost clustering performance. We benchmark our approach on a suite of synthetic and real world clustering problems, where our algorithm outperforms state of the art interpretable and non-interpretable clustering algorithms."

Unlike other hyperparameter searches, we formulate hyperparameter scheduling as a standard Markov Decision Process and use episodic memory to store the outcome of used hyperparameters and their training contexts. At any policy update step, the policy learner refers to the stored experiences, and adaptively reconfigures its learning algorithm with the new hyperparameters determined by the memory. This mechanism, dubbed as Episodic Policy Gradient Training (EPGT), enables an episodic learning process, and jointly learns the policy and the learning algorithm's hyperparameters within a single run. Experimental results on both continuous and discrete environments demonstrate the advantage of using the proposed method in boosting the performance of various policy gradient algorithms."

Most works focus on analysing properties of the optimal decision rule under such manipulations. In our work we take a learning theoretic perspective, focusing on the sample complexity needed to learn a good decision rule which is robust to strategic manipulation. We perform this analysis by introducing a novel loss function, the \emph{strategic manipulation loss}, which takes into account both the accuracy of the final decision rule and its vulnerability to manipulation. We analyse the sample complexity for a known graph of possible manipulations in terms of the complexity of the function class and the manipulation graph. Additionally, we initialize the study of learning under unknown manipulation capabilities of the involved agents. Using techniques from transfer learning theory, we define a similarity measure for manipulation graphs and show that learning outcomes are robust with respect to small changes in the manipulation graph. Lastly, we analyse the (sample complexity of) learning of the manipulation capability of agents with respect to this similarity measure, providing novel guarantees for strategic classification with respect to an unknown manipulation graph."

While verifying stability in deterministic control systems is extensively studied in the literature, verifying stability in stochastic control systems is an open problem. The few existing works on this topic either consider only specialized forms of stochasticity or make restrictive assumptions on the system, rendering them inapplicable to learning algorithms with neural network policies. In this work, we present an approach for general nonlinear stochastic control problems with two novel aspects: (a) instead of classical stochastic extensions of Lyapunov functions, we use ranking supermartingales (RSMs) to certify a.s.~asymptotic stability, and (b) we present a method for learning neural network RSMs. We prove that our approach guarantees a.s.~asymptotic stability of the system and provides the first method to obtain bounds on the stabilization time, which stochastic Lyapunov functions do not. Finally, we validate our approach experimentally on a set of nonlinear stochastic reinforcement learning environments with neural network policies."

However, previous work has indicated that off-the-shelf MLMs are not effective as universal lexical or sentence encoders without further task-specific fine-tuning on NLI, sentence similarity, or paraphrasing tasks using annotated task data. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to turn MLMs into effective universal lexical and sentence encoders even without any additional data and without any supervision. We propose an extremely simple, fast and effective contrastive learning technique, termed Mirror-BERT, which converts MLMs (e.g., BERT and RoBERTa) into such encoders in 20-30 seconds without any additional external knowledge. Mirror-BERT relies on fully identical or slightly modified string pairs as positive (i.e., synonymous) fine-tuning examples, and aims to maximise their similarity during identity fine-tuning. We report huge gains over off-the-shelf MLMs with Mirror-BERT in both lexical-level and sentence-level tasks, across different domains and different languages. Notably, in the standard sentence semantic similarity (STS) tasks, our self-supervised Mirror-BERT model even matches the performance of the task-tuned Sentence-BERT models from prior work. Finally, we delve deeper into the inner workings of MLMs, and suggest some evidence on why this simple approach can yield effective universal lexical and sentence encoders."

While traditional marginal-based methods have achieved impressive results, recent work has shown that deep learning-based approaches tend to lag behind. In this work, we present Differentially-Private TaBular AutoRegressive Transformer (DP-TBART), a transformer-based autoregressive model that maintains differential privacy and achieves performance competitive with marginal-based methods on a wide variety of datasets, capable of even outperforming state-of-the-art methods in certain settings. We also provide a theoretical framework for understanding the limitations of marginal-based approaches and where deep learning-based approaches stand to contribute most. These results suggest that deep learning-based techniques should be considered as a viable alternative to marginal-based methods in the generation of differentially private synthetic tabular data."

The incorporation of MMD naturally leads to an exact and tractable mathematical formulation of fairness with good statistical properties. We formulate the problem of fair PCA subject to MMD constraints as a non-convex optimization over the Stiefel manifold and solve it using the Riemannian Exact Penalty Method with Smoothing (REPMS; Liu and Boumal, 2019). Importantly, we provide local optimality guarantees and explicitly show the theoretical effect of each hyperparameter in practical settings, extending previous results. Experimental comparisons based on synthetic and UCI datasets show that our approach outperforms prior work in explained variance, fairness, and runtime."

We leverage insights from time series regression in econometrics and construct asymptotically pivotal statistics via random scaling. Our approach is fully operational with online data and is rigorously underpinned by a functional central limit theorem. Our proposed inference method has a couple of key advantages over the existing methods. First, the test statistic is computed in an online fashion with only SGD iterates and the critical values can be obtained without any resampling methods, thereby allowing for efficient implementation suitable for massive online data. Second, there is no need to estimate the asymptotic variance and our inference method is shown to be robust to changes in the tuning parameters for SGD algorithms in simulation experiments with synthetic data."

Adversarial examples of 2D images and 3D point clouds have been extensively studied, but studies on event-based data are limited. Event-based data can be an alternative to a 2D image under high-speed movements, such as autonomous driving. However, the given adversarial events make the current deep learning model vulnerable to safety issues. In this work, we generate adversarial examples and then train the robust models for event-based data, for the first time. Our algorithm shifts the time of the original events and generates additional adversarial events. Additional adversarial events are generated in two stages. First, null events are added to the event-based data to generate additional adversarial events. The perturbation size can be controlled with the number of null events. Second, the location and time of additional adversarial events are set to mislead DNNs in a gradient-based attack. Our algorithm achieves an attack success rate of 97.95\% on the N-Caltech101 dataset. Furthermore, the adversarial training model improves robustness on the adversarial event data compared to the original model."

There is little work in using game-based learning methods in AI literacy. Games are known to be compelling media to teach children about complex STEM concepts. In this work, we developed a competitive card game for middle and high school students called ""AI Audit"" where they play as AI start-up founders building novel AI-powered technology. Players can challenge other players with potential harms of their technology or defend their own businesses by features that mitigate these harms. The game mechanics reward systems that are ethically developed or that take steps to mitigate potential harms.

This is non-trivial because human motion is inherently multi-modal: given a history of human motion paths, there are many plausible ways by which people could move in the future. Additionally, people activities are often driven by goals, e.g. reaching particular locations or interacting with the environment. We address the aforementioned aspects by proposing a new recurrent generative model that considers both single agents' future goals and interactions between different agents. The model exploits a double attention-based graph neural network to collect information about the mutual influences among different agents and to integrate it with data about agents' possible future objectives. Our proposal is general enough to be applied to different scenarios: the model achieves state-of-the-art results in both urban environments and also in sports applications."

To achieve satisfactory performance, the methods employ refined edge information and low multi-level discrepancy. However, both performance gain and computational efficiency cannot be attained, which has motivated us to study the inefficiencies in existing encoder-decoder structures to avoid this trade-off. We propose TRACER, which detects salient objects with explicit edges by incorporating attention guided tracing modules. We employ a masked edge attention module at the end of the first encoder using a fast Fourier transform to propagate the refined edge information to the downstream feature extraction. In the multi-level aggregation phase, the union attention module identifies the complementary channel and important spatial information. To improve the decoder performance and computational efficiency, we minimize the decoder block usage with object attention module. This module extracts undetected objects and edge information from refined channels and spatial representations. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive pixel intensity loss function to deal with the relatively important pixels unlike conventional loss functions which treat all pixels equally. A comparison with 13 existing methods reveals that TRACER achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets. We have released TRACER at https://github.com/Karel911/TRACER."

Most of the previous UVOS models use the first frame or the entire video as a reference frame to specify the mask of the foreground object. Our question is why the first frame should be selected as a reference frame or why the entire video should be used to specify the mask. We believe that we can select a better reference frame to achieve the better UVOS performance than using only the first frame or the entire video as a reference frame. In our paper, we propose Easy Frame Selector (EFS). The EFS enables us to select an 'easy' reference frame that makes the subsequent VOS become easy, thereby improving the VOS performance. Furthermore, we propose a new framework named as Iterative Mask Prediction (IMP). In the framework, we repeat applying EFS to the given video and selecting an 'easier' reference frame from the video than the previous iteration, increasing the VOS performance incrementally. The IMP consists of EFS, Bi-directional Mask Prediction (BMP), and Temporal Information Updating (TIU). From the proposed framework, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in three UVOS benchmark sets: DAVIS16, FBMS, and SegTrack-V2."

Load balancing is, therefore, a critical operation for the efficient execution of parallel algorithms. In this paper we consider the fundamental class of tree-based algorithms that are notoriously irregular, and hard to load-balance with existing static techniques. We propose a hybrid load balancing method using the utility of statistical random sampling in estimating the tree depth and node count distributions to uniformly partition an input tree. To conduct an initial performance study, we implemented the method on an Intel Xeon Phi accelerator system. We considered the tree traversal operation on both regular and irregular unbalanced trees manifested by Fibonacci and unbalanced (biased) randomly generated trees, respectively. The results show scalable performance for up to the 60 physical processors of the accelerator, as well as an extrapolated 128 processors case."

Not only those cross-shard transactions degrade the system throughput but also double the confirmation time, and exhaust an already scarce network bandwidth. Are cross-shard transactions imminent for sharding schemes? In this paper, we propose a new sharding paradigm, called OptChain, in which cross-shard transactions are minimized, resulting in almost twice faster confirmation time and throughput. By treating transactions as a stream of nodes in an online graph, OptChain utilizes a lightweight and on-the-fly transaction placement method to group both related and soon-related transactions into the same shards. At the same time, OptChain maintains a temporal balance among shards to guarantee the high parallelism. Our comprehensive and large-scale simulation using Oversim P2P library confirms a significant boost in performance with up to 10 folds reduction in cross-shard transactions, more than twice reduction in confirmation time, and 50% increase in throughput. When combined with Omniledger sharding protocol, OptChain delivers a 6000 transactions per second throughput with 10.5s confirmation time."

The total distance driven by the vehicles and the fleet size can be reduced by employing ridesharing, i.e., by assigning multiple passengers to one vehicle. However, finding the optimal passenger-vehicle assignment in an MoD system is a hard combinatorial problem. In this work, we demonstrate how the VGA method, a recently proposed systematic method for ridesharing, can be used to compute the optimal passenger-vehicle assignments and corresponding vehicle routes in a massive-scale MoD system. In contrast to existing works, we solve all passenger-vehicle assignment problems to optimality, regularly dealing with instances containing thousands of vehicles and passengers. Moreover, to examine the impact of using optimal ridesharing assignments, we compare the performance of an MoD system that uses optimal assignments against an MoD system that uses assignments computed using insertion heuristic and against an MoD system that uses no ridesharing. We found that the system that uses optimal ridesharing assignments subject to the maximum travel delay of 4 minutes reduces the vehicle distance driven by 57 % compared to an MoD system without ridesharing. Furthermore, we found that the optimal assignments result in a 20 % reduction in vehicle distance driven and 5 % lower average passenger travel delay compared to a system that uses insertion heuristic."

We broaden the exploration to examine $\delta$-CLUE, the set of potential CLUEs within a $\delta$ ball of the original input in latent space. We study the diversity of such sets and find that many CLUEs are redundant; as such, we propose DIVerse CLUE ($\nabla$-CLUE), a set of CLUEs which each propose a distinct explanation as to how one can decrease the uncertainty associated with an input. We then further propose GLobal AMortised CLUE (GLAM-CLUE), a distinct and novel method which learns amortised mappings on specific groups of uncertain inputs, taking them and efficiently transforming them in a single function call into inputs for which a model will be certain. Our experiments show that $\delta$-CLUE, $\nabla$-CLUE, and GLAM-CLUE all address shortcomings of CLUE and provide beneficial explanations of uncertainty estimates to practitioners."

However, most existing deep hashing methods learn a whole set of hashing functions independently, while ignore the correlations between different hashing functions that can promote the retrieval accuracy greatly. Inspired by the sequential decision ability of deep reinforcement learning, we propose a new Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for Image Hashing (DRLIH). Our proposed DRLIH approach models the hashing learning problem as a sequential decision process, which learns each hashing function by correcting the errors imposed by previous ones and promotes retrieval accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address hashing problem from deep reinforcement learning perspective. The main contributions of our proposed DRLIH approach can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a deep reinforcement learning hashing network. In the proposed network, we utilize recurrent neural network (RNN) as agents to model the hashing functions, which take actions of projecting images into binary codes sequentially, so that the current hashing function learning can take previous hashing functions' error into account. (2) We propose a sequential learning strategy based on proposed DRLIH. We define the state as a tuple of internal features of RNN's hidden layers and image features, which can reflect history decisions made by the agents. We also propose an action group method to enhance the correlation of hash functions in the same group. Experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DRLIH approach."

In this work, we investigate what individuals can do to avoid being detected by those models while using social media platforms. We ground our investigation in two exposure-risky tasks, stance detection and geotagging. We explore a variety of simple techniques for modifying text, such as inserting typos in salient words, paraphrasing, and adding dummy social media posts. Our experiments show that the performance of BERT-based models fined tuned for stance detection decreases significantly due to typos, but it is not affected by paraphrasing. Moreover, we find that typos have minimal impact on state-of-the-art geotagging models due to their increased reliance on social networks; however, we show that users can deceive those models by interacting with different users, reducing their performance by almost 50%."

Classic algorithms for bilevel optimization admit a double loop structure which is computationally expensive. Recently, several single loop algorithms have been proposed with optimizing the inner and outer variable alternatively. However, these algorithms not yet achieve fully single loop. As they overlook the loop needed to evaluate the hyper-gradient for a given inner and outer state. In order to develop a fully single loop algorithm, we first study the structure of the hyper-gradient and identify a general approximation formulation of hyper-gradient computation that encompasses several previous common approaches, e.g. back-propagation through time, conjugate gradient, \emph{etc.} Based on this formulation, we introduce a new state variable to maintain the historical hyper-gradient information. Combining our new formulation with the alternative update of the inner and outer variables, we propose an efficient fully single loop algorithm. We theoretically show that the error generated by the new state can be bounded and our algorithm converges with the rate of $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. Finally, we verify the efficacy our algorithm empirically through multiple bilevel optimization based machine learning tasks."

In this paper, a hierarchical deep learning framework is proposed to verify the land use information. For this purpose, a two-step strategy is applied. First, given high-resolution aerial images, the land cover information is determined. To achieve this, an encoder-decoder based convolutional neural net-work (CNN) is proposed. Second, the pixel-wise land cover information along with the aerial images serves as input for another CNN to classify land use. Because the object catalogue of geospatial databases is frequently constructed in a hierarchical manner, we propose a new CNN-based method aiming to predict land use in multiple levels hierarchically and simultaneously. A so called Joint Optimization (JO) is proposed where predictions are made by selecting the hier-archical tuple over all levels which has the maximum joint class scores, providing consistent results across the different levels. The conducted experiments show that the CNN relying on JO outperforms previous results, achieving an overall accuracy up to 92.5%. In addition to the individual experiments on two test sites, we investigate whether data showing different characteristics can improve the results of land cover and land use classification, when processed together. To do so, we combine the two datasets and undertake some additional experiments. The results show that adding more data helps both land cover and land use classification, especially the identification of underrepre-sented categories, despite their different characteristics."

Utilizing the regularity condition, we show for the first time that random Fourier features classification can achieve $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ learning rate with only $\Omega(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ features, as opposed to $\Omega(n)$ features suggested by previous results. Our study covers the standard feature sampling method for which we reduce the number of features required, as well as a problem-dependent sampling method which further reduces the number of features while still keeping the optimal generalization property. Moreover, we prove that the random Fourier features classification can obtain a fast $O(1/n)$ learning rate for both sampling schemes under Massart's low noise assumption. Our results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of random Fourier features approximation in reducing the computational complexity (roughly from $O(n^3)$ in time and $O(n^2)$ in space to $O(n^2)$ and $O(n\sqrt{n})$ respectively) without having to trade-off the statistical prediction accuracy. In addition, the achieved trade-off in our analysis is at least the same as the optimal results in the literature under the worst case scenario and significantly improves the optimal results under benign regularity conditions."

In the current deep learning era, remarkable progress in processing such two data modalities has been achieved through respectively customizing compatible 3D and 2D network architectures. However, unlike multi-view image-based 2D visual modeling paradigms, which have shown leading performance in several common 3D shape recognition benchmarks, point cloud-based 3D geometric modeling paradigms are still highly limited by insufficient learning capacity, due to the difficulty of extracting discriminative features from irregular geometric signals. In this paper, we explore the possibility of boosting deep 3D point cloud encoders by transferring visual knowledge extracted from deep 2D image encoders under a standard teacher-student distillation workflow. Generally, we propose PointMCD, a unified multi-view cross-modal distillation architecture, including a pretrained deep image encoder as the teacher and a deep point encoder as the student. To perform heterogeneous feature alignment between 2D visual and 3D geometric domains, we further investigate visibility-aware feature projection (VAFP), by which point-wise embeddings are reasonably aggregated into view-specific geometric descriptors. By pair-wisely aligning multi-view visual and geometric descriptors, we can obtain more powerful deep point encoders without exhausting and complicated network modification. Experiments on 3D shape classification, part segmentation, and unsupervised learning strongly validate the effectiveness of our method.

This will be conducted under the parabolic regularity, a second-order regularity condition that was recently utilized in [13] for second-order variational analysis of constraint systems. Besides justifying the twice epi-differentiablity of composite functions, we obtain precise formulas for their second subderivatives under the metric subregularity constraint qualification. The latter allows us to derive second-order optimality conditions for a large class of composite optimization problems."
776,aaai,2022,Optimal Local Explainer Aggregation for Interpretable Prediction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21458,"A key challenge for decision makers when incorporating black box machine learned models into practice is being able to understand the predictions provided by these models. One proposed set of methods is training surrogate explainer models which approximate the more complex model. Explainer methods are generally classified as either local or global, depending on what portion of the data space they are purported to explain. The improved coverage of global explainers usually comes at the expense of explainer fidelity. One way of trading off the advantages of both approaches is to aggregate several local explainers into a single explainer model with improved coverage. However, the problem of aggregating these local explainers is computationally challenging, and existing methods only use heuristics to form these aggregations.   In this paper we propose a local explainer aggregation method which selects local explainers using non-convex optimization. In contrast to other heuristic methods, we use an integer optimization framework to combine local explainers into a near-global aggregate explainer. Our framework allows a decision-maker to directly tradeoff coverage and fidelity of the resulting aggregation through the parameters of the optimization problem. We also propose a novel local explainer algorithm based on information filtering. We evaluate our algorithmic framework on two healthcare datasets---the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) data set and a geriatric mobility dataset---which is motivated by the anticipated need for explainable precision medicine. Our method outperforms existing local explainer aggregation methods in terms of both fidelity and coverage of classification and improves on fidelity over existing global explainer methods, particularly in multi-class settings where state-of-the-art methods achieve 70% and ours achieves 90%."
777,aaai,2022,How Does Knowledge Graph Embedding Extrapolate to Unseen Data: A Semantic Evidence View,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20521,"Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to learn representations for entities and relations. Most KGE models have gained great success, especially on extrapolation scenarios. Specifically, given an unseen triple (h, r, t), a trained model can still correctly predict t from (h, r, ?), or h from (?, r, t), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However, most existing KGE works focus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tells us how to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but offers limited explanation of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are the important factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we attempt to study the KGE extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to unseen data? 2. How to design the KGE model with better extrapolation ability? For the problem 1, we first discuss the impact factors for extrapolation and from relation, entity and triple level respectively, propose three Semantic Evidences (SEs), which can be observed from train set and provide important semantic information for extrapolation. Then we verify the effectiveness of SEs through extensive experiments on several typical KGE methods. For the problem 2, to make better use of the three levels of SE, we propose a novel GNN-based KGE model, called Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network (SE-GNN). In SE-GNN, each level of SE is modeled explicitly by the corresponding neighbor pattern, and merged sufficiently by the multi-layer aggregation, which contributes to obtaining more extrapolative knowledge representation. Finally, through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that SE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on Knowledge Graph Completion task and performs a better extrapolation ability. Our code is available at https://github.com/renli1024/SE-GNN."

While as a price, generated pseudo-masks exist obvious noisy pixels, which result in sub-optimal segmentation models trained over these pseudo-masks. But rare studies notice or work on this problem, even these noisy pixels are inevitable after their improvements on pseudo-mask. So we try to improve WSSS in the aspect of noise mitigation. And we observe that many noisy pixels are of high confidence, especially when the response range is too wide or narrow, presenting an uncertain status. Thus, in this paper, we simulate noisy variations of response by scaling the prediction map multiple times for uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty is then used to weight the segmentation loss to mitigate noisy supervision signals. We call this method URN, abbreviated from Uncertainty estimation via Response scaling for Noise mitigation. Experiments validate the benefits of URN, and our method achieves state-of-the-art results at 71.2% and 41.5% on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 respectively, without extra models like saliency detection.

779,aaai,2022,Chunk Dynamic Updating for Group Lasso with ODEs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20704,"The group lasso is a penalized regression method, used in regression problems where the covariates are partitioned into groups to promote sparsity at the group level. Existing methods for finding the group lasso estimator either use gradient projection methods to update the entire coefficient vector simultaneously at each step, or update one group of coefficients at a time using an inexact line search to approximate the optimal value for the group of coefficients when all other groups' coefficients are fixed. We present a new method of computation for the group lasso in the linear regression case, the Single Line Search (SLS) algorithm, which operates by computing the exact optimal value for each group (when all other coefficients are fixed) with one univariate line search. We perform simulations demonstrating that the SLS algorithm is often more efficient than existing computational methods. We also extend the SLS algorithm to the sparse group lasso problem via the Signed Single Line Search (SSLS) algorithm, and give theoretical results to support both algorithms."
780,aaai,2022,Sequence-to-Action: Grammatical Error Correction with Action Guided Sequence Generation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21345,"The task of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) has received remarkable attention with wide applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. While one of the key principles of GEC is to keep the correct parts unchanged and avoid over-correction, previous sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models generate results from scratch, which are not guaranteed to follow the original sentence structure and may suffer from the over-correction problem. In the meantime, the recently proposed sequence tagging models can overcome the over-correction problem by only generating edit operations, but are conditioned on human designed language-specific tagging labels. In this paper, we combine the pros and alleviate the cons of both models by proposing a novel Sequence-to-Action~(S2A) module. The S2A module jointly takes the source and target sentences as input, and is able to automatically generate a token-level action sequence before predicting each token, where each action is generated from three choices named SKIP, COPY and GENerate. Then the actions are fused with the basic seq2seq framework to provide final predictions. We conduct experiments on the benchmark datasets of both English and Chinese GEC tasks. Our model consistently outperforms the seq2seq baselines, while being able to significantly alleviate the over-correction problem as well as holding better generality and diversity in the generation results compared to the sequence tagging models."
781,aaai,2022,Unifying Model Explainability and Robustness for Joint Text Classification and Rationale Extraction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21342,"Recent works have shown explainability and robustness are two crucial ingredients of trustworthy and reliable text classification. However, previous works usually address one of two aspects: i) how to extract accurate rationales for explainability while being beneficial to prediction; ii) how to make the predictive model robust to different types of adversarial attacks. Intuitively, a model that produces helpful explanations should be more robust against adversarial attacks, because we cannot trust the model that outputs explanations but changes its prediction under small perturbations. To this end, we propose a joint classification and rationale extraction model named AT-BMC. It includes two key mechanisms: mixed Adversarial Training (AT) is designed to use various perturbations in discrete and embedding space to improve the model's robustness, and Boundary Match Constraint (BMC) helps to locate rationales more precisely with the guidance of boundary information. Performances on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed AT-BMC outperforms baselines on both classification and rationale extraction by a large margin. Robustness analysis shows that the proposed AT-BMC decreases the attack success rate effectively by up to 69%. The empirical results indicate that there are connections between robust models and better explanations."

In this paper, we consider tensor optimization with a convex and well-conditioned objective function and reformulate it into a nonconvex optimization using the Burer-Monteiro type parameterization. We analyze the local convergence of applying vanilla gradient descent to the factored formulation and establish a local regularity condition under mild assumptions. We also provide a linear convergence analysis of the gradient descent algorithm started in a neighborhood of the true tensor factors. Complementary to the local analysis, this work also characterizes the global geometry of the best rank-one tensor approximation problem and demonstrates that for orthogonally decomposable tensors the problem has no spurious local minima and all saddle points are strict except for the one at zero which is a third-order saddle point."

The Kotlin compiler, while slowly and steadily becoming more and more mature, still crashes from time to time on the more tricky input programs, not least because of the complexity of its features and their interactions. This makes it a great target for fuzzing, even the basic forms of which can find a significant number of Kotlin compiler crashes.   There is a problem with fuzzing, however, closely related to the cause of the crashes: generating a random, non-trivial and semantically valid Kotlin program is hard. In this paper, we talk about type-centric compiler fuzzing in the form of type-centric enumeration, an approach inspired by skeletal program enumeration and based on a combination of generative and mutation-based fuzzing, which solves this problem by focusing on program types. After creating the skeleton program, we fill the typed holes with fragments of suitable type, created via generation and enhanced by semantic-aware mutation.   We implemented this approach in our Kotlin compiler fuzzing framework called Backend Bug Finder (BBF) and did an extensive evaluation, not only testing the real-world feasibility of our approach, but also comparing it to other compiler fuzzing techniques. The results show our approach to be significantly better compared to other fuzzing approaches at generating semantically valid Kotlin programs, while creating more interesting crash-inducing inputs at the same time. We managed to find more than 50 previously unknown compiler crashes, of which 18 were considered important after their triage by the compiler team."

At the heart of our network is a meta-learning approach that learns to compare representations of variable temporal length, that is, either two videos of different length (in the case of few-shot action recognition) or a video and a semantic representation such as word vector (in the case of zero-shot action recognition). By contrast to other works in few-shot and zero-shot action recognition, we a) utilise attention mechanisms so as to perform temporal alignment, and b) learn a deep-distance measure on the aligned representations at video segment level. We adopt an episode-based training scheme and train our network in an end-to-end manner. The proposed method does not require any fine-tuning in the target domain or maintaining additional representations as is the case of memory networks. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the state of the art in few-shot action recognition, and achieves competitive results in zero-shot action recognition."

To address the above problems, we propose to leverage external knowledge, including commonsense knowledge and emotional lexical knowledge, to explicitly understand and express emotions in empathetic dialogue generation. We first enrich the dialogue history by jointly interacting with external knowledge and construct an emotional context graph. Then we learn emotional context representations from the knowledge-enriched emotional context graph and distill emotional signals, which are the prerequisites to predicate emotions expressed in responses. Finally, to generate the empathetic response, we propose an emotional cross-attention mechanism to learn the emotional dependencies from the emotional context graph. Extensive experiments conducted on a benchmark dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we find the performance of our method can be further improved by integrating with a pre-trained model that works orthogonally."

However, how to combine the heterogeneous information and exploit the complementarity of multi-modal signals remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal Perception Tracker (MPT) for speaker tracking using both audio and visual modalities. Specifically, a novel acoustic map based on spatial-temporal Global Coherence Field (stGCF) is first constructed for heterogeneous signal fusion, which employs a camera model to map audio cues to the localization space consistent with the visual cues. Then a multi-modal perception attention network is introduced to derive the perception weights that measure the reliability and effectiveness of intermittent audio and video streams disturbed by noise. Moreover, a unique cross-modal self-supervised learning method is presented to model the confidence of audio and visual observations by leveraging the complementarity and consistency between different modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed MPT achieves 98.6% and 78.3% tracking accuracy on the standard and occluded datasets, respectively, which demonstrates its robustness under adverse conditions and outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods."

Due to the requirement of understanding cross-modal semantics within individual instances, this task is more challenging than the traditional semi-supervised video object segmentation where the ground truth object masks in the first frame are given. With the great achievement of Transformer in object detection and object segmentation, RVOS has been made remarkable progress where ReferFormer achieved the state-of-the-art performance.

We develop shape-aware adversarial 3D point cloud attacks by leveraging the learned latent space of a point cloud auto-encoder where the adversarial noise is applied in the latent space. Specifically, we propose three different variants including an exemplar-based one by guiding the shape deformation with auxiliary data, such that the generated point cloud resembles the shape morphing between objects in the same category. Different from prior works, the resulting adversarial 3D point clouds reflect the shape variations in the 3D point cloud space while still being close to the original one. In addition, experimental evaluations on the ModelNet40 benchmark demonstrate that our adversaries are more difficult to defend with existing point cloud defense methods and exhibit a higher attack transferability across classifiers. Our shape-aware adversarial attacks are orthogonal to existing point cloud based attacks and shed light on the vulnerability of 3D deep neural networks."
789,aaai,2022,Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection via Rank Mimicking and Prediction-Guided Feature Imitation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20018,"Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely-used technology to inherit information from cumbersome teacher models to compact student models, consequently realizing model compression and acceleration. Compared with image classification, object detection is a more complex task, and designing specific KD methods for object detection is non-trivial. In this work, we elaborately study the behaviour difference between the teacher and student detection models, and obtain two intriguing observations: First, the teacher and student rank their detected candidate boxes quite differently, which results in their precision discrepancy. Second, there is a considerable gap between the feature response differences and prediction differences between teacher and student, indicating that equally imitating all the feature maps of the teacher is the sub-optimal choice for improving the student's accuracy. Based on the two observations, we propose Rank Mimicking (RM) and Prediction-guided Feature Imitation (PFI) for distilling one-stage detectors, respectively. RM takes the rank of candidate boxes from teachers as a new form of knowledge to distill, which consistently outperforms the traditional soft label distillation. PFI attempts to correlate feature differences with prediction differences, making feature imitation directly help to improve the student's accuracy. On MS COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks, extensive experiments are conducted on various detectors with different backbones to validate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, RetinaNet with ResNet50 achieves 40.4% mAP in MS COCO, which is 3.5% higher than its baseline, and also outperforms previous KD methods."

The proposed method actively queries the label of informative instance pairs, while estimating underlying metrics by incorporating unlabeled instance pairs, which leads to a more accurate and efficient clustering process. In particular, we augment the queried constraints by generating more pairwise labels to provide additional information in learning a metric to enhance clustering performance. Furthermore, we increase the robustness of metric learning by updating the learned metric sequentially and penalizing the irrelevant features adaptively. In addition, we propose a novel active query strategy that evaluates the information gain of instance pairs more accurately by incorporating the neighborhood structure, which improves clustering efficiency without extra labeling cost. In theory, we provide a tighter error bound of the proposed metric learning method utilizing augmented queries compared with methods using existing constraints only. Furthermore, we also investigate the improvement using the active query strategy instead of random selection. Numerical studies on simulation settings and real datasets indicate that the proposed method is especially advantageous when the signal-to-noise ratio between significant features and irrelevant features is low."
791,aaai,2022,SCAN: Cross Domain Object Detection with Semantic Conditioned Adaptation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20031,"Real-world object detectors are often challenged by the domain gaps between different datasets. In this work, we present the Conditional Domain Normalization (CDN) to bridge the domain gap. CDN is designed to encode different domain inputs into a shared latent space, where the features from different domains carry the same domain attribute. To achieve this, we first disentangle the domain-specific attribute out of the semantic features from one domain via a domain embedding module, which learns a domain-vector to characterize the corresponding domain attribute information. Then this domain-vector is used to encode the features from another domain through a conditional normalization, resulting in different domains' features carrying the same domain attribute. We incorporate CDN into various convolution stages of an object detector to adaptively address the domain shifts of different level's representation. In contrast to existing adaptation works that conduct domain confusion learning on semantic features to remove domain-specific factors, CDN aligns different domain distributions by modulating the semantic features of one domain conditioned on the learned domain-vector of another domain. Extensive experiments show that CDN outperforms existing methods remarkably on both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation benchmarks, including 2D image detection and 3D point cloud detection."

It is not only a more challenging task than regular VQA but also a vital step towards building a general VQA system. Most existing knowledge-based VQA systems process knowledge and image information similarly and ignore the fact that the knowledge base (KB) contains complete information about a triplet, while the extracted image information might be incomplete as the relations between two objects are missing or wrongly detected. In this paper, we propose a novel model named dynamic knowledge memory enhanced multi-step graph reasoning (DMMGR), which performs explicit and implicit reasoning over a key-value knowledge memory module and a spatial-aware image graph, respectively. Specifically, the memory module learns a dynamic knowledge representation and generates a knowledge-aware question representation at each reasoning step. Then, this representation is used to guide a graph attention operator over the spatial-aware image graph. Our model achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on the KRVQR and FVQA datasets. We also conduct ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness of each component of the proposed model."
793,aaai,2022,Rethinking the Optimization of Average Precision: Only Penalizing Negative Instances before Positive Ones Is Enough,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20042,"Optimizing the approximation of Average Precision (AP) has been widely studied for image retrieval. Limited by the definition of AP, such methods consider both negative and positive instances ranking before each positive instance. However, we claim that only penalizing negative instances before positive ones is enough, because the loss only comes from these negative instances. To this end, we propose a novel loss, namely Penalizing Negative instances before Positive ones (PNP), which can directly minimize the number of negative instances before each positive one. In addition, AP-based methods adopt a fixed and sub-optimal gradient assignment strategy. Therefore, we systematically investigate different gradient assignment solutions via constructing derivative functions of the loss, resulting in PNP-I with increasing derivative functions and PNP-D with decreasing ones. PNP-I focuses more on the hard positive instances by assigning larger gradients to them and tries to make all relevant instances closer. In contrast, PNP-D pays less attention to such instances and slowly corrects them. For most real-world data, one class usually contains several local clusters. PNP-I blindly gathers these clusters while PNP-D keeps them as they were. Therefore, PNP-D is more superior. Experiments on three standard retrieval datasets show consistent results with the above analysis. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PNP-D achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Such recommendations are highly effective when they are based on collaborative signals like co-purchase statistics. In certain online marketplaces, however, e.g., on online auction sites, constantly new items are added to the catalog. In such cases, complementary item recommendations are often based on item side-information due to a lack of interaction data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that can leverage both item side-information and labeled complementary item pairs to generate effective complementary recommendations for cold items, i.e., for items for which no co-purchase statistics yet exist. Given that complementary items typically have to be of a different category than the seed item, we technically maintain a latent space for each item category. Simultaneously, we learn to project distributed item representations into these category spaces to determine suitable recommendations. The main learning process in our architecture utilizes labeled pairs of complementary items. In addition, we adopt ideas from Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) to leverage available item information even in case no labeled data exists for a given item and category. Experiments on three e-commerce datasets show that our method is highly effective."

Using a combination of experimental and observational data, Li and Pearl derived tight bounds on the ""benefit function"" - the payoff/cost associated with selecting an individual with given characteristics. This paper shows that these bounds can be narrowed significantly (enough to change decisions) when structural information is available in the form of a causal model. We address the problem of estimating the benefit function using observational and experimental data when specific graphical criteria are assumed to hold."

One can make the prior distribution of these symbols a design choice. The recent IR-Net of Qin et al. argues that imposing a Bernoulli distribution with equal priors (equal bit ratios) over the binary weights leads to maximum entropy and thus minimizes information loss. However, prior work cannot precisely control the binary weight distribution during training, and therefore cannot guarantee maximum entropy. Here, we show that quantizing using optimal transport can guarantee any bit ratio, including equal ratios. We investigate experimentally that equal bit ratios are indeed preferable and show that our method leads to optimization benefits. We show that our quantization method is effective when compared to state-of-the-art binarization methods, even when using binary weight pruning."
798,aaai,2022,Policy Learning for Robust Markov Decision Process with a Mismatched Generative Model,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20705,"In high-stake scenarios like medical treatment and auto-piloting, it's risky or even infeasible to collect online experimental data to train the agent. Simulation-based training can alleviate this issue, but may suffer from its inherent mismatches from the simulator and real environment. It is therefore imperative to utilize the simulator to learn a robust policy for the real-world deployment. In this work, we consider policy learning for Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDP), where the agent tries to seek a robust policy with respect to unexpected perturbations on the environments. Specifically, we focus on the setting where the training environment can be characterized as a generative model and a constrained perturbation can be added to the model during testing. Our goal is to identify a near-optimal robust policy for the perturbed testing environment, which introduces additional technical difficulties as we need to simultaneously estimate the training environment uncertainty from samples and find the worst-case perturbation for testing. To solve this issue, we propose a generic method which formalizes the perturbation as an opponent to obtain a two-player zero-sum game, and further show that the Nash Equilibrium corresponds to the robust policy. We prove that, with a polynomial number of samples from the generative model, our algorithm can find a near-optimal robust policy with a high probability. Our method is able to deal with general perturbations under some mild assumptions and can also be extended to more complex problems like robust partial observable Markov decision process, thanks to the game-theoretical formulation."
799,aaai,2022,Reliability Exploration with Self-Ensemble Learning for Domain Adaptive Person Re-identification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20043,"Domain generalization (DG) has attracted much attention in person re-identification (ReID) recently. It aims to make a model trained on multiple source domains generalize to an unseen target domain. Although achieving promising progress, existing methods usually need the source domains to be labeled, which could be a significant burden for practical ReID tasks. In this paper, we turn to investigate unsupervised domain generalization for ReID, by assuming that no label is available for any source domains.   To address this challenging setting, we propose a simple and efficient domain-specific adaptive framework, and realize it with an adaptive normalization module designed upon the batch and instance normalization techniques. In doing so, we successfully yield reliable pseudo-labels to implement training and also enhance the domain generalization capability of the model as required. In addition, we show that our framework can even be applied to improve person ReID under the settings of supervised domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation, demonstrating competitive performance with respect to relevant methods. Extensive experimental study on benchmark datasets is conducted to validate the proposed framework. A significance of our work lies in that it shows the potential of unsupervised domain generalization for person ReID and sets a strong baseline for the further research on this topic."

Feature perturbation and label perturbation receive increasing attention in recent years. They have been proven to be useful in various deep learning approaches. For example, (adversarial) feature perturbation can improve the robustness or even generalization capability of learned models. However, limited studies have explicitly explored for the perturbation of logit vectors. This work discusses several existing methods related to class-level logit perturbation. A unified viewpoint between positive/negative data augmentation and loss variations incurred by logit perturbation is established. A theoretical analysis is provided to illuminate why class-level logit perturbation is useful. Accordingly, new methodologies are proposed to explicitly learn to perturb logits for both single-label and multi-label classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark image classification data sets and their long-tail versions indicated the competitive performance of our learning method. As it only perturbs on logit, it can be used as a plug-in to fuse with any existing classification algorithms. All the codes are available at https://github.com/limengyang1992/lpl."

In this paper, we address both problems. We introduce a probabilistic meta-learning model for domain generalization, in which classifier parameters shared across domains are modeled as distributions. This enables better handling of prediction uncertainty on unseen domains. To deal with domain shift, we learn domain-invariant representations by the proposed principle of meta variational information bottleneck, we call MetaVIB. MetaVIB is derived from novel variational bounds of mutual information, by leveraging the meta-learning setting of domain generalization. Through episodic training, MetaVIB learns to gradually narrow domain gaps to establish domain-invariant representations, while simultaneously maximizing prediction accuracy.

The comparison results demonstrate our method outperforms previous approaches consistently."
802,aaai,2022,Retinomorphic Object Detection in Asynchronous Visual Streams,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20021,"DAVIS camera, streaming two complementary sensing modalities of asynchronous events and frames, has gradually been used to address major object detection challenges (e.g., fast motion blur and low-light). However, how to effectively leverage rich temporal cues and fuse two heterogeneous visual streams remains a challenging endeavor. To address this challenge, we propose a novel streaming object detector with Transformer, namely SODFormer, which first integrates events and frames to continuously detect objects in an asynchronous manner. Technically, we first build a large-scale multimodal neuromorphic object detection dataset (i.e., PKU-DAVIS-SOD) over 1080.1k manual labels. Then, we design a spatiotemporal Transformer architecture to detect objects via an end-to-end sequence prediction problem, where the novel temporal Transformer module leverages rich temporal cues from two visual streams to improve the detection performance. Finally, an asynchronous attention-based fusion module is proposed to integrate two heterogeneous sensing modalities and take complementary advantages from each end, which can be queried at any time to locate objects and break through the limited output frequency from synchronized frame-based fusion strategies. The results show that the proposed SODFormer outperforms four state-of-the-art methods and our eight baselines by a significant margin. We also show that our unifying framework works well even in cases where the conventional frame-based camera fails, e.g., high-speed motion and low-light conditions. Our dataset and code can be available at https://github.com/dianzl/SODFormer."

While for video domains, how to effectively model temporal context with the attention of object instances across frames remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose an online video instance segmentation framework with a novel instance-aware temporal fusion method. We first leverages the representation, i.e., a latent code in the global context (instance code) and CNN feature maps to represent instance- and pixel-level features. Based on this representation, we introduce a cropping-free temporal fusion approach to model the temporal consistency between video frames. Specifically, we encode global instance-specific information in the instance code and build up inter-frame contextual fusion with hybrid attentions between the instance codes and CNN feature maps. Inter-frame consistency between the instance codes are further enforced with order constraints. By leveraging the learned hybrid temporal consistency, we are able to directly retrieve and maintain instance identities across frames, eliminating the complicated frame-wise instance matching in prior methods. Extensive experiments have been conducted on popular VIS datasets, i.e. Youtube-VIS-19/21. Our model achieves the best performance among all online VIS methods. Notably, our model also eclipses all offline methods when using the ResNet-50 backbone."
805,aaai,2022,Rethinking Pseudo Labels for Semi-supervised Object Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20019,"Recent advances in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) are largely driven by consistency-based pseudo-labeling methods for image classification tasks, producing pseudo labels as supervisory signals. However, when using pseudo labels, there is a lack of consideration in localization precision and amplified class imbalance, both of which are critical for detection tasks. In this paper, we introduce certainty-aware pseudo labels tailored for object detection, which can effectively estimate the classification and localization quality of derived pseudo labels. This is achieved by converting conventional localization as a classification task followed by refinement. Conditioned on classification and localization quality scores, we dynamically adjust the thresholds used to generate pseudo labels and reweight loss functions for each category to alleviate the class imbalance problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves state-of-the-art SSOD performance by 1-2% AP on COCO and PASCAL VOC while being orthogonal and complementary to most existing methods. In the limited-annotation regime, our approach improves supervised baselines by up to 10% AP using only 1-10% labeled data from COCO."
806,aaai,2022,Transcribing Natural Languages for the Deaf via Neural Editing Programs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21457,"This work studies the task of glossification, of which the aim is to em transcribe natural spoken language sentences for the Deaf (hard-of-hearing) community to ordered sign language glosses. Previous sequence-to-sequence language models trained with paired sentence-gloss data often fail to capture the rich connections between the two distinct languages, leading to unsatisfactory transcriptions. We observe that despite different grammars, glosses effectively simplify sentences for the ease of deaf communication, while sharing a large portion of vocabulary with sentences. This has motivated us to implement glossification by executing a collection of editing actions, e.g. word addition, deletion, and copying, called editing programs, on their natural spoken language counterparts. Specifically, we design a new neural agent that learns to synthesize and execute editing programs, conditioned on sentence contexts and partial editing results. The agent is trained to imitate minimal editing programs, while exploring more widely the program space via policy gradients to optimize sequence-wise transcription quality. Results show that our approach outperforms previous glossification models by a large margin."
807,aaai,2022,Shrinking Temporal Attention in Transformers for Video Action Recognition,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20013,"Modeling long-term context in videos is crucial for many fine-grained tasks including temporal action segmentation. An interesting question that is still open is how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance. While transformers can model the long-term context of a video, this becomes computationally prohibitive for long videos. Recent works on temporal action segmentation thus combine temporal convolutional networks with self-attentions that are computed only for a local temporal window. While these approaches show good results, their performance is limited by their inability to capture the full context of a video. In this work, we try to answer how much long-term temporal context is required for temporal action segmentation by introducing a transformer-based model that leverages sparse attention to capture the full context of a video. We compare our model with the current state of the art on three datasets for temporal action segmentation, namely 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101. Our experiments show that modeling the full context of a video is necessary to obtain the best performance for temporal action segmentation."
808,aaai,2022,Towards an Effective Orthogonal Dictionary Convolution Strategy,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20037,"In this paper, we introduce a Deep Convolutional Analysis Dictionary Model (DeepCAM) by learning convolutional dictionaries instead of unstructured dictionaries as in the case of deep analysis dictionary model introduced in the companion paper. Convolutional dictionaries are more suitable for processing high-dimensional signals like for example images and have only a small number of free parameters. By exploiting the properties of a convolutional dictionary, we present an efficient convolutional analysis dictionary learning approach. A L-layer DeepCAM consists of L layers of convolutional analysis dictionary and element-wise soft-thresholding pairs and a single layer of convolutional synthesis dictionary. Similar to DeepAM, each convolutional analysis dictionary is composed of a convolutional Information Preserving Analysis Dictionary (IPAD) and a convolutional Clustering Analysis Dictionary (CAD). The IPAD and the CAD are learned using variations of the proposed learning algorithm. We demonstrate that DeepCAM is an effective multilayer convolutional model and, on single image super-resolution, achieves performance comparable with other methods while also showing good generalization capabilities."

It is assumed that the data distribution does not change over time (stationarity). However, in real-world scenarios, the data generation process changes over time and the model has to adapt to the new incoming data. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and leads to a decrease in the predictive model's performance. In this study, we propose a new concept drift detection method based on autoregressive models called ADDM. This method can be integrated into any machine learning algorithm from deep neural networks to simple linear regression model. Our results show that this new concept drift detection method outperforms the state-of-the-art drift detection methods, both on synthetic data sets and real-world data sets. Our approach is theoretically guaranteed as well as empirical and effective for the detection of various concept drifts. In addition to the drift detector, we proposed a new method of concept drift adaptation based on the severity of the drift."

Therefore, modeling long-range contextual emotional relationships with speaker dependency plays a crucial part in dialogue emotion recognition. Meanwhile, distinguishing the different emotion categories is non-trivial since they usually have semantically similar sentiments. To this end, we adopt supervised contrastive learning to make different emotions mutually exclusive to identify similar emotions better. Meanwhile, we utilize an auxiliary response generation task to enhance the model's ability of handling context information, thereby forcing the model to recognize emotions with similar semantics in diverse contexts. To achieve these objectives, we use the pre-trained encoder-decoder model BART as our backbone model since it is very suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. The experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our proposed model obtains significantly more favorable results than the state-of-the-art model in dialogue emotion recognition. The ablation study further demonstrates the effectiveness of supervised contrastive loss and generative loss."
812,aaai,2022,Learning Universal Adversarial Perturbation by Adversarial Example,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20023,"Adversarial training, in which a network is trained on both adversarial and clean examples, is one of the most trusted defense methods against adversarial attacks. However, there are three major practical difficulties in implementing and deploying this method - expensive in terms of extra memory and computation costs; accuracy trade-off between clean and adversarial examples; and lack of diversity of adversarial perturbations. Classical adversarial training uses fixed, precomputed perturbations in adversarial examples (input space). In contrast, we introduce dynamic adversarial perturbations into the parameter space of the network, by adding perturbation biases to the fully connected layers of deep convolutional neural network. During training, using only clean images, the perturbation biases are updated in the Fast Gradient Sign Direction to automatically create and store adversarial perturbations by recycling the gradient information computed. The network learns and adjusts itself automatically to these learned adversarial perturbations. Thus, we can achieve adversarial training with negligible cost compared to requiring a training set of adversarial example images. In addition, if combined with classical adversarial training, our perturbation biases can alleviate accuracy trade-off difficulties, and diversify adversarial perturbations."

Recent advancements in representation learning have been shown to greatly improve the performance of molecular property prediction. However, due to limited labeled data, supervised learning-based molecular representation algorithms can only search limited chemical space, which results in poor generalizability. In this work, we proposed a self-supervised representation learning framework for large-scale unlabeled molecules. We developed a novel molecular graph augmentation strategy, referred to as attention-wise graph mask, to generate challenging positive sample for contrastive learning. We adopted the graph attention network (GAT) as the molecular graph encoder, and leveraged the learned attention scores as masking guidance to generate molecular augmentation graphs. By minimization of the contrastive loss between original graph and masked graph, our model can capture important molecular structure and higher-order semantic information. Extensive experiments showed that our attention-wise graph mask contrastive learning exhibit state-of-the-art performance in a couple of downstream molecular property prediction tasks."

Here, we describe how a recently proposed counterfactual approach developed to deconfound linear structural causal models can still be used to deconfound the feature representations learned by deep neural network (DNN) models. The key insight is that by training an accurate DNN using softmax activation at the classification layer, and then adopting the representation learned by the last layer prior to the output layer as our features, we have that, by construction, the learned features will fit well a (multi-class) logistic regression model, and will be linearly associated with the labels. As a consequence, deconfounding approaches based on simple linear models can be used to deconfound the feature representations learned by DNNs. We validate the proposed methodology using colored versions of the MNIST dataset. Our results illustrate how the approach can effectively combat confounding and improve model stability in the context of dataset shifts generated by selection biases."

However, with the increasing amount of RGB-D data captured from sophisticated sensors like Microsoft Kinect, and the recent advances in the area of sophisticated deep learning techniques, introduction of an efficient deep learning technique for scene flow estimation, is becoming important. This paper introduces a first effort to apply a deep learning method for direct estimation of scene flow by presenting a fully convolutional neural network with an encoder-decoder (ED) architecture. The proposed network SceneEDNet involves estimation of three dimensional motion vectors of all the scene points from sequence of stereo images. The training for direct estimation of scene flow is done using consecutive pairs of stereo images and corresponding scene flow ground truth. The proposed architecture is applied on a huge dataset and provides meaningful results."

However, in theory, due to the highly non-convex, non-concave landscape of the minmax training objective, GAN remains one of the least understood deep learning models. In this work, we formally study how GANs can efficiently learn certain hierarchically generated distributions that are close to the distribution of real-life images. We prove that when a distribution has a structure that we refer to as Forward Super-Resolution, then simply training generative adversarial networks using stochastic gradient descent ascent (SGDA) can learn this distribution efficiently, both in sample and time complexities. We also provide empirical evidence that our assumption ""forward super-resolution"" is very natural in practice, and the underlying learning mechanisms that we study in this paper (to allow us efficiently train GAN via SGDA in theory) simulates the actual learning process of GANs on real-world problems."

Moreover, we provide a hypothesis testing framework for these definitions and study the effect of ""don't know"" in the trade-off between privacy and utility in discrete distribution estimation."

However, for video action recognition, the action of interest might only exist in arbitrary clips of untrimmed web videos, resulting in high label noises in the temporal space. To address this issue, we introduce a new method for pre-training video action recognition models using queried web videos. Instead of trying to filter out, we propose to convert the potential noises in these queried videos to useful supervision signals by defining the concept of Sub-Pseudo Label (SPL). Specifically, SPL spans out a new set of meaningful ""middle ground"" label space constructed by extrapolating the original weak labels during video querying and the prior knowledge distilled from a teacher model. Consequently, SPL provides enriched supervision for video models to learn better representations. SPL is fairly simple and orthogonal to popular teacher-student self-training frameworks without extra training cost. We validate the effectiveness of our method on four video action recognition datasets and a weakly-labeled image dataset to study the generalization ability. Experiments show that SPL outperforms several existing pre-training strategies using pseudo-labels and the learned representations lead to competitive results when fine-tuning on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 compared with recent pre-training methods."

Specifically, the phrase branch is supervised by semantic embeddings, whose ground truths are automatically converted from the original HOI annotations without extra human efforts. Meanwhile, a novel label composition method is proposed to deal with the long-tailed problem in HOI, which composites novel phrase labels by semantic neighbors. Further, to optimize the phrase branch, a loss composed of a distilling loss and a balanced triplet loss is proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed PhraseHOI, which achieves significant improvement over the baseline and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on Full and NonRare on the challenging HICO-DET benchmark."

Previous works treat this task as sequence generation, however, it is challenging to render a music-aligned long-term sequence with high kinematic complexity and coherent movements. In this paper, we reformulate it by a two-stage process, ie, a key pose generation and then an in-between parametric motion curve prediction, where the key poses are easier to be synchronized with the music beats and the parametric curves can be efficiently regressed to render fluent rhythm-aligned movements. We named the proposed method as DanceFormer, which includes two cascading kinematics-enhanced transformer-guided networks (called DanTrans) that tackle each stage, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale music conditioned 3D dance dataset, called PhantomDance, that is accurately labeled by experienced animators rather than reconstruction or motion capture. This dataset also encodes dances as key poses and parametric motion curves apart from pose sequences, thus benefiting the training of our DanceFormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, even trained by existing datasets, can generate fluent, performative, and music-matched 3D dances that surpass previous works quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, the proposed DanceFormer, together with the PhantomDance dataset (https://github.com/libuyu/PhantomDanceDataset), are seamlessly compatible with industrial animation software, thus facilitating the adaptation for various downstream applications."

Most existing 3D object detection methods recognize objects individually, without giving any consideration on contextual information between these objects. Comparatively, we propose Multi-Level Context VoteNet (MLCVNet) to recognize 3D objects correlatively, building on the state-of-the-art VoteNet. We introduce three context modules into the voting and classifying stages of VoteNet to encode contextual information at different levels. Specifically, a Patch-to-Patch Context (PPC) module is employed to capture contextual information between the point patches, before voting for their corresponding object centroid points. Subsequently, an Object-to-Object Context (OOC) module is incorporated before the proposal and classification stage, to capture the contextual information between object candidates. Finally, a Global Scene Context (GSC) module is designed to learn the global scene context. We demonstrate these by capturing contextual information at patch, object and scene levels. Our method is an effective way to promote detection accuracy, achieving new state-of-the-art detection performance on challenging 3D object detection datasets, i.e., SUN RGBD and ScanNet.

Specifically, we formulate three novel continuity-related pretext tasks, i.e. continuity justification, discontinuity localization, and missing section approximation, that jointly supervise a shared backbone for video representation learning. This self-supervision approach, termed as Continuity Perception Network (CPNet), solves the three tasks altogether and encourages the backbone network to learn local and long-ranged motion and context representations. It outperforms prior arts on multiple downstream tasks, such as action recognition, video retrieval, and action localization. Additionally, the video continuity can be complementary to other coarse-grained video properties for representation learning, and integrating the proposed pretext task to prior arts can yield much performance gains."

Previous works learn to navigate step-by-step following an instruction. However, these works may fail to discriminate the similarities and discrepancies across instruction-trajectory pairs and ignore the temporal continuity of sub-instructions. These problems hinder agents from learning distinctive vision-and-language representations, harming the robustness and generalizability of the navigation policy. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive Instruction-Trajectory Learning (CITL) framework that explores invariance across similar data samples and variance across different ones to learn distinctive representations for robust navigation. Specifically, we propose: (1) a coarse-grained contrastive learning objective to enhance vision-and-language representations by contrasting semantics of full trajectory observations and instructions, respectively; (2) a fine-grained contrastive learning objective to perceive instructions by leveraging the temporal information of the sub-instructions; (3) a pairwise sample-reweighting mechanism for contrastive learning to mine hard samples and hence mitigate the influence of data sampling bias in contrastive learning. Our CITL can be easily integrated with VLN backbones to form a new learning paradigm and achieve better generalizability in unseen environments.

827,aaai,2022,One More Check: Making &quot;Fake Background&quot; Be Tracked Again,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20045,"Intuitive observations show that a baby may inherently possess the capability of recognizing a new visual concept (e.g., chair, dog) by learning from only very few positive instances taught by parent(s) or others, and this recognition capability can be gradually further improved by exploring and/or interacting with the real instances in the physical world. Inspired by these observations, we propose a computational model for slightly-supervised object detection, based on prior knowledge modelling, exemplar learning and learning with video contexts. The prior knowledge is modeled with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). When very few instances of a new concept are given, an initial concept detector is built by exemplar learning over the deep features from the pre-trained CNN. Simulating the baby's interaction with physical world, the well-designed tracking solution is then used to discover more diverse instances from the massive online unlabeled videos. Once a positive instance is detected/identified with high score in each video, more variable instances possibly from different view-angles and/or different distances are tracked and accumulated. Then the concept detector can be fine-tuned based on these new instances. This process can be repeated again and again till we obtain a very mature concept detector. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC-07/10/12 object detection datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. It can beat the state-of-the-art full-training based performances by learning from very few samples for each object category, along with about 20,000 unlabeled videos."

We are particularly interested in the probability of large portfolio losses. We describe the popular models in the credit risk framework including factor models and copula models. To this end, we revisit the most efficient probability estimation algorithms within current copula credit risk literature, namely importance sampling. We illustrate the workings and developments of these algorithms for large portfolio loss probability estimation and quantile estimation. We then propose a modification to the dynamic splitting method which allows application to the credit risk models described. Our proposed algorithm for the unbiased estimation of rare-event probabilities, exploits the quasi-monotonic property of functions to embed a static simulation problem within a time-dependent Markov process. A study of our proposed algorithm is then conducted through numerical experiments with its performance benchmarked against current popular importance sampling algorithms."

However, most prior arts failed to detect the semantic components and their relationships behind the images, which makes them lack discriminative power. To make up the defect, we propose a novel Deep Semantic Components Hashing (DSCH), which involves a common sense that an image normally contains a bunch of semantic components with homology and co-occurrence relationships. Based on this prior, DSCH regards the semantic components as latent variables under the Expectation-Maximization framework and designs a two-step iterative algorithm with the objective of maximum likelihood of training data. Firstly, DSCH constructs a semantic component structure by uncovering the fine-grained semantics components of images with a Gaussian Mixture Modal~(GMM), where an image is represented as a mixture of multiple components, and the semantics co-occurrence are exploited. Besides, coarse-grained semantics components, are discovered by considering the homology relationships between fine-grained components, and the hierarchy organization is then constructed. Secondly, DSCH makes the images close to their semantic component centers at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels, and also makes the images share similar semantic components close to each other. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical semantic components indeed facilitate the hashing model to achieve superior performance."
830,aaai,2022,A Causal Inference Look at Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20053,"Deep learning (DL) algorithms can be used to automate paranasal anomaly detection from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, previous works relied on supervised learning techniques to distinguish between normal and abnormal samples. This method limits the type of anomalies that can be classified as the anomalies need to be present in the training data. Further, many data points from normal and anomaly class are needed for the model to achieve satisfactory classification performance. However, experienced clinicians can segregate between normal samples (healthy maxillary sinus) and anomalous samples (anomalous maxillary sinus) after looking at a few normal samples. We mimic the clinicians ability by learning the distribution of healthy maxillary sinuses using a 3D convolutional auto-encoder (cAE) and its variant, a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture and evaluate cAE and VAE for this task. Concretely, we pose the paranasal anomaly detection as an unsupervised anomaly detection problem. Thereby, we are able to reduce the labelling effort of the clinicians as we only use healthy samples during training. Additionally, we can classify any type of anomaly that differs from the training distribution. We train our 3D cAE and VAE to learn a latent representation of healthy maxillary sinus volumes using L1 reconstruction loss. During inference, we use the reconstruction error to classify between normal and anomalous maxillary sinuses. We extract sub-volumes from larger head and neck MRIs and analyse the effect of different fields of view on the detection performance. Finally, we report which anomalies are easiest and hardest to classify using our approach. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of unsupervised detection of paranasal anomalies from MRIs with an AUPRC of 85% and 80% for cAE and VAE, respectively."
831,aaai,2022,Dynamic Spatial Propagation Network for Depth Completion,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20055,"Image-guided depth completion aims to generate dense depth maps with sparse depth measurements and corresponding RGB images. Currently, spatial propagation networks (SPNs) are the most popular affinity-based methods in depth completion, but they still suffer from the representation limitation of the fixed affinity and the over smoothing during iterations. Our solution is to estimate independent affinity matrices in each SPN iteration, but it is over-parameterized and heavy calculation. This paper introduces an efficient model that learns the affinity among neighboring pixels with an attention-based, dynamic approach. Specifically, the Dynamic Spatial Propagation Network (DySPN) we proposed makes use of a non-linear propagation model (NLPM). It decouples the neighborhood into parts regarding to different distances and recursively generates independent attention maps to refine these parts into adaptive affinity matrices. Furthermore, we adopt a diffusion suppression (DS) operation so that the model converges at an early stage to prevent over-smoothing of dense depth. Finally, in order to decrease the computational cost required, we also introduce three variations that reduce the amount of neighbors and attentions needed while still retaining similar accuracy. In practice, our method requires less iteration to match the performance of other SPNs and yields better results overall. DySPN outperforms other state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on KITTI Depth Completion (DC) evaluation by the time of submission and is able to yield SoTA performance in NYU Depth v2 dataset as well."

Recent works tried to control the overall prediction risk with classification with rejection options. However, existing works overlook the different significance of different classes. We introduce Set-classifier with Class-specific RIsk Bounds (SCRIB) to tackle this problem, assigning multiple labels to each example. Given the output of a black-box model on the validation set, SCRIB constructs a set-classifier that controls the class-specific prediction risks with a theoretical guarantee. The key idea is to reject when the set classifier returns more than one label. We validated SCRIB on several medical applications, including sleep staging on electroencephalogram (EEG) data, X-ray COVID image classification, and atrial fibrillation detection based on electrocardiogram (ECG) data. SCRIB obtained desirable class-specific risks, which are 35\%-88\% closer to the target risks than baseline methods."
833,aaai,2022,Conditional Local Convolution for Spatio-Temporal Meteorological Forecasting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20711,"Spatio-temporal forecasting is challenging attributing to the high nonlinearity in temporal dynamics as well as complex location-characterized patterns in spatial domains, especially in fields like weather forecasting. Graph convolutions are usually used for modeling the spatial dependency in meteorology to handle the irregular distribution of sensors' spatial location. In this work, a novel graph-based convolution for imitating the meteorological flows is proposed to capture the local spatial patterns. Based on the assumption of smoothness of location-characterized patterns, we propose conditional local convolution whose shared kernel on nodes' local space is approximated by feedforward networks, with local representations of coordinate obtained by horizon maps into cylindrical-tangent space as its input. The established united standard of local coordinate system preserves the orientation on geography. We further propose the distance and orientation scaling terms to reduce the impacts of irregular spatial distribution. The convolution is embedded in a Recurrent Neural Network architecture to model the temporal dynamics, leading to the Conditional Local Convolution Recurrent Network (CLCRN). Our model is evaluated on real-world weather benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with obvious improvements. We conduct further analysis on local pattern visualization, model's framework choice, advantages of horizon maps and etc."
834,aaai,2022,On the Use of Unrealistic Predictions in Hundreds of Papers Evaluating Graph Representations,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20712,"Prediction using the ground truth sounds like an oxymoron in machine learning. However, such an unrealistic setting was used in hundreds, if not thousands of papers in the area of finding graph representations. To evaluate the multi-label problem of node classification by using the obtained representations, many works assume in the prediction stage that the number of labels of each test instance is known. In practice such ground truth information is rarely available, but we point out that such an inappropriate setting is now ubiquitous in this research area. We detailedly investigate why the situation occurs. Our analysis indicates that with unrealistic information, the performance is likely over-estimated. To see why suitable predictions were not used, we identify difficulties in applying some multi-label techniques. For the use in future studies, we propose simple and effective settings without using practically unknown information. Finally, we take this chance to conduct a fair and serious comparison of major graph-representation learning methods on multi-label node classification."
835,aaai,2022,A Semi-supervised Learning Approach with Two Teachers to Improve Breakdown Identification in Dialogues,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21349,"Identifying breakdowns in ongoing dialogues helps to improve communication effectiveness. Most prior work on this topic relies on human annotated data and data augmentation to learn a classification model. While quality labeled dialogue data requires human annotation and is usually expensive to obtain, unlabeled data is easier to collect from various sources. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised teacher-student learning framework to tackle this task. We introduce two teachers which are trained on labeled data and perturbed labeled data respectively. We leverage unlabeled data to improve classification in student training where we employ two teachers to refine the labeling of unlabeled data through teacher-student learning in a bootstrapping manner. Through our proposed training approach, the student can achieve improvements over single-teacher performance. Experimental results on the Dialogue Breakdown Detection Challenge dataset DBDC5 and Learning to Identify Follow-Up Questions dataset LIF show that our approach outperforms all previous published approaches as well as other supervised and semi-supervised baseline methods."

In this paper, we propose to integrate deep and unsupervised saliency for salient object detection under a unified framework. Specifically, our method takes results of unsupervised saliency (Robust Background Detection, RBD) and normalized color images as inputs, and directly learns an end-to-end mapping between inputs and the corresponding saliency maps. The color images are fed into a Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) adapted from semantic segmentation to exploit high-level semantic cues for salient object detection. Then the results from deep FCNN and RBD are concatenated to feed into a shallow network to map the concatenated feature maps to saliency maps. Finally, to obtain a spatially consistent saliency map with sharp object boundaries, we fuse superpixel level saliency map at multi-scale. Extensive experimental results on 8 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with a margin."
837,aaai,2022,Unpaired Multi-Domain Stain Transfer for Kidney Histopathological Images,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20054,"Renal pathology, as the gold standard of kidney disease diagnosis, requires doctors to analyze a series of tissue slices stained by H&E staining and special staining like Masson, PASM, and PAS, respectively. These special staining methods are costly, time-consuming, and hard to standardize for wide use especially in primary hospitals. Advances of supervised learning methods have enabled the virtually conversion of H&E images into special staining images, but achieving pixel-to-pixel alignment for training remains challenging. In contrast, unsupervised learning methods regarding different stains as different style transfer domains can utilize unpaired data, but they ignore the spatial inter-domain correlations and thus decrease the trustworthiness of structural details for diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel virtual staining framework AGMDT to translate images into other domains by avoiding pixel-level alignment and meanwhile utilizing the correlations among adjacent tissue slices. We first build a high-quality multi-domain renal histological dataset where each specimen case comprises a series of slices stained in various ways. Based on it, the proposed framework AGMDT discovers patch-level aligned pairs across the serial slices of multi-domains through glomerulus detection and bipartite graph matching, and utilizes such correlations to supervise the end-to-end model for multi-domain staining transformation. Experimental results show that the proposed AGMDT achieves a good balance between the precise pixel-level alignment and unpaired domain transfer by exploiting correlations across multi-domain serial pathological slices, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative measure and morphological details."
838,aaai,2022,Conjugated Discrete Distributions for Distributional Reinforcement Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20716,"In this work we continue to build upon recent advances in reinforcement learning for finite Markov processes. A common approach among previous existing algorithms, both single-actor and distributed, is to either clip rewards or to apply a transformation method on Q-functions to handle a large variety of magnitudes in real discounted returns. We theoretically show that one of the most successful methods may not yield an optimal policy if we have a non-deterministic process. As a solution, we argue that distributional reinforcement learning lends itself to remedy this situation completely. By the introduction of a conjugated distributional operator we may handle a large class of transformations for real returns with guaranteed theoretical convergence. We propose an approximating single-actor algorithm based on this operator that trains agents directly on unaltered rewards using a proper distributional metric given by the Cram\'er distance. To evaluate its performance in a stochastic setting we train agents on a suite of 55 Atari 2600 games using sticky-actions and obtain state-of-the-art performance compared to other well-known algorithms in the Dopamine framework."

However, its natural extension to the sequential setting, the \textit{Extensive Form Correlated Equilibrium} (EFCE), requires a quadratic amount of space to solve, even in restricted settings without randomness in nature. To alleviate these concerns, we apply \textit{subgame resolving}, a technique extremely successful in finding NE in zero-sum games to solving general-sum EFCEs. Subgame resolving refines a correlation plan in an \textit{online} manner: instead of solving for the full game upfront, it only solves for strategies in subgames that are reached in actual play, resulting in significant computational gains. In this paper, we (i) lay out the foundations to quantify the quality of a refined strategy, in terms of the \textit{social welfare} and \textit{exploitability} of correlation plans, (ii) show that EFCEs possess a sufficient amount of independence between subgames to perform resolving efficiently, and (iii) provide two algorithms for resolving, one using linear programming and the other based on regret minimization. Both methods guarantee \textit{safety}, i.e., they will never be counterproductive. Our methods are the first time an online method has been applied to the correlated, general-sum setting."

Yet this would be a much needed feature for practical applications. In this paper, we propose an approach which learns a hyper-policy, whose input is time, that outputs the parameters of the policy to be queried at that time. This hyper-policy is trained to maximize the estimated future performance, efficiently reusing past data by means of importance sampling, at the cost of introducing a controlled bias. We combine the future performance estimate with the past performance to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. To avoid overfitting the collected data, we derive a differentiable variance bound that we embed as a penalization term. Finally, we empirically validate our approach, in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms, on realistic environments, including water resource management and trading."
841,aaai,2022,Learning Auxiliary Monocular Contexts Helps Monocular 3D Object Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20074,"Monocular 3D object detection aims to localize 3D bounding boxes in an input single 2D image. It is a highly challenging problem and remains open, especially when no extra information (e.g., depth, lidar and/or multi-frames) can be leveraged in training and/or inference. This paper proposes a simple yet effective formulation for monocular 3D object detection without exploiting any extra information. It presents the MonoCon method which learns Monocular Contexts, as auxiliary tasks in training, to help monocular 3D object detection. The key idea is that with the annotated 3D bounding boxes of objects in an image, there is a rich set of well-posed projected 2D supervision signals available in training, such as the projected corner keypoints and their associated offset vectors with respect to the center of 2D bounding box, which should be exploited as auxiliary tasks in training. The proposed MonoCon is motivated by the Cramer-Wold theorem in measure theory at a high level. In implementation, it utilizes a very simple end-to-end design to justify the effectiveness of learning auxiliary monocular contexts, which consists of three components: a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based feature backbone, a number of regression head branches for learning the essential parameters used in the 3D bounding box prediction, and a number of regression head branches for learning auxiliary contexts. After training, the auxiliary context regression branches are discarded for better inference efficiency. In experiments, the proposed MonoCon is tested in the KITTI benchmark (car, pedestrain and cyclist). It outperforms all prior arts in the leaderboard on car category and obtains comparable performance on pedestrian and cyclist in terms of accuracy. Thanks to the simple design, the proposed MonoCon method obtains the fastest inference speed with 38.7 fps in comparisons"
842,aaai,2022,Multi-Knowledge Aggregation and Transfer for Semantic Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20077,"Semantic segmentation for SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images has attracted increasing attention in the remote sensing community recently, due to SAR's all-time and all-weather imaging capability. However, SAR images are generally more difficult to be segmented than their EO (Electro-Optical) counterparts, since speckle noises and layovers are inevitably involved in SAR images. To address this problem, we investigate how to introduce EO features to assist the training of a SAR-segmentation model, and propose a heterogeneous feature distillation network for segmenting SAR images, called HFD-Net, where a SAR-segmentation student model gains knowledge from a pre-trained EO-segmentation teacher model. In the proposed HFD-Net, both the student and teacher models employ an identical architecture but different parameter configurations, and a heterogeneous feature distillation model is explored for transferring latent EO features from the teacher model to the student model and then enhancing the ability of the student model for SAR image segmentation. In addition, a heterogeneous feature alignment module is explored to aggregate multi-scale features for segmentation in each of the student model and teacher model. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed HFD-Net outperforms seven state-of-the-art SAR image semantic segmentation methods."
843,aaai,2022,DiffSinger: Singing Voice Synthesis via Shallow Diffusion Mechanism,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21350,"Singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems are built to synthesize high-quality and expressive singing voice, in which the acoustic model generates the acoustic features (e.g., mel-spectrogram) given a music score. Previous singing acoustic models adopt a simple loss (e.g., L1 and L2) or generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct the acoustic features, while they suffer from over-smoothing and unstable training issues respectively, which hinder the naturalness of synthesized singing. In this work, we propose DiffSinger, an acoustic model for SVS based on the diffusion probabilistic model. DiffSinger is a parameterized Markov chain that iteratively converts the noise into mel-spectrogram conditioned on the music score. By implicitly optimizing variational bound, DiffSinger can be stably trained and generate realistic outputs. To further improve the voice quality and speed up inference, we introduce a shallow diffusion mechanism to make better use of the prior knowledge learned by the simple loss. Specifically, DiffSinger starts generation at a shallow step smaller than the total number of diffusion steps, according to the intersection of the diffusion trajectories of the ground-truth mel-spectrogram and the one predicted by a simple mel-spectrogram decoder. Besides, we propose boundary prediction methods to locate the intersection and determine the shallow step adaptively. The evaluations conducted on a Chinese singing dataset demonstrate that DiffSinger outperforms state-of-the-art SVS work. Extensional experiments also prove the generalization of our methods on text-to-speech task (DiffSpeech). Audio samples: https://diffsinger.github.io.

However, such strong assumption may not always hold in practice, especially in medical field where the data sharing is highly concerned and sometimes prohibitive due to privacy issue. This paper studies the important yet challenging single domain generalization problem, in which a model is learned under the worst-case scenario with only one source domain to directly generalize to different unseen target domains. We present a novel approach to address this problem in medical image segmentation, which extracts and integrates the semantic shape prior information of segmentation that are invariant across domains and can be well-captured even from single domain data to facilitate segmentation under distribution shifts. Besides, a test-time adaptation strategy with dual-consistency regularization is further devised to promote dynamic incorporation of these shape priors under each unseen domain to improve model generalizability. Extensive experiments on two medical image segmentation tasks demonstrate the consistent improvements of our method across various unseen domains, as well as its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in addressing domain generalization under the worst-case scenario."

Without access to the unseen domain, the feature statistics of the batch normalization (BN) layer learned from a limited number of source domains is doubtlessly biased for unseen domain. This would mislead the feature representation learning for unseen domain and deteriorate the generalizaiton ability of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel Debiased Batch Normalization via Gaussian Process approach (GDNorm) for generalizable person re-identification, which models the feature statistic estimation from BN layers as a dynamically self-refining Gaussian process to alleviate the bias to unseen domain for improving the generalization. Specifically, we establish a lightweight model with multiple set of domain-specific BN layers to capture the discriminability of individual source domain, and learn the corresponding parameters of the domain-specific BN layers. These parameters of different source domains are employed to deduce a Gaussian process. We randomly sample several paths from this Gaussian process served as the BN estimations of potential new domains outside of existing source domains, which can further optimize these learned parameters from source domains, and estimate more accurate Gaussian process by them in return, tending to real data distribution. Even without a large number of source domains, GDNorm can still provide debiased BN estimation by using the mean path of the Gaussian process, while maintaining low computational cost during testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GDNorm effectively improves the generalization ability of the model on unseen domain."

In this task, the correct camera pose is the key to generating accurate lanes, which can transform an image from perspective-view to the top-view. With this transformation, we can get rid of the perspective effects so that 3D lanes would look similar and can accurately be fitted by low-order polynomials. However, mainstream 3D lane detectors rely on perfect camera poses provided by other sensors, which is expensive and encounters multi-sensor calibration issues. To overcome this problem, we propose to predict 3D lanes by estimating camera pose from a single image with a two-stage framework. The first stage aims at the camera pose task from perspective-view images. To improve pose estimation, we introduce an auxiliary 3D lane task and geometry constraints to benefit from multi-task learning, which enhances consistencies between 3D and 2D, as well as compatibility in the above two tasks. The second stage targets the 3D lane task. It uses previously estimated pose to generate top-view images containing distance-invariant lane appearances for predicting accurate 3D lanes. Experiments demonstrate that, without ground truth camera pose, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art perfect-camera-pose-based methods and has the fewest parameters and computations.

Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection.

We propose the Opportunistic Source Routing (OSR), a scalable and reliable downward routing protocol for WSNs/IoT. OSR introduces opportunistic routing into traditional source routing based on the parent set of a node's upward routing in data collection, significantly addressing the drastic link dynamics in low-power and lossy WSNs. We devise a novel adaptive Bloom filter mechanism to effectively and efficiently encode a downward source-route in OSR, which enables a significant reduction of the length of source-route field in packet header. OSR is scalable to very large-size WSN/IoT deployments, since each resource-constrained node in the network only stores the set of its direct children. The probabilistic nature of the Bloom filter passively explores opportunistic routing. Upon a delivery failure at any hop along the downward path, OSR actively performs opportunistic routing to bypass the obsolete/bad link. We demonstrate the desirable scalability of OSR against the standard RPL downward routing. We evaluate the performance of OSR via both simulations and real-world testbed experiments, in comparison with the standard RPL (both storing mode and non-storing mode), ORPL, and the representative dissemination protocol Drip. Our results show that OSR significantly outperforms RPL and ORPL in scalability and reliability. OSR also achieves significantly better energy efficiency compared to TinyRPL and Drip which are based on the same TinyOS platform as OSR implementation."

We aim to extract basic emotions from short sentences with emotional content (e.g. news titles, tweets, captions), performing a web-based quantitative evaluation of semantic proximity between each word of the analyzed sentence and each emotion of a psychological model (e.g. Plutchik, Ekman, Lovheim). The phases of the extraction include: text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine automated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of semantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The main idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under the assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search engines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through tags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions. Training results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative tests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g. Kendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to each single word. Different from sentiment analysis, our approach works at a deeper level of abstraction, aiming at recognizing specific emotions and not only the positive/negative sentiment, in order to predict emotions as semantic data."

Learning from few examples is a known challenge for deep learning based classification algorithms, and is the focus of the field of low-shot learning. One potential approach to increase the training data for these rare classes is to augment the limited real data with synthetic samples. This has been shown to help, but the domain shift between real and synthetic hinders the approaches' efficacy when tested on real data.   We explore the use of image-to-image translation methods to close the domain gap between synthetic and real imagery for animal species classification in data collected from camera traps: motion-activated static cameras used to monitor wildlife. We use low-level feature alignment between source and target domains to make synthetic data for a rare species generated using a graphics engine more ""realistic"".

However, uneven terrain will bring two problems to motion planning: how to assess the traversability of the terrain and how to cope with the dynamics model of the robot associated with the terrain. The trajectories generated by existing methods are often too conservative or cannot be tracked well by the controller since the second problem is not well solved. In this paper, we propose terrain pose mapping to describe the impact of terrain on the robot. With this mapping, we can obtain the SE(3) state of the robot on uneven terrain for a given state in SE(2). Then, based on it, we present a trajectory optimization framework for car-like robots on uneven terrain that can consider both of the above problems. The trajectories generated by our method conform to the dynamics model of the system without being overly conservative and yet able to be tracked well by the controller.

Among these, cartoonization of real-world scenes has promising applications in entertainment and industry. Different from image translations focusing on improving the style effect of generated images, video cartoonization has additional requirements on the temporal consistency. In this paper, we propose a spatially-adaptive semantic alignment framework with perceptual motion consistency for coherent video cartoonization in an unsupervised manner. The semantic alignment module is designed to restore deformation of semantic structure caused by spatial information lost in the encoder-decoder architecture. Furthermore, we devise the spatio-temporal correlative map as a style-independent, global-aware regularization on the perceptual motion consistency. Deriving from similarity measurement of high-level features in photo and cartoon frames, it captures global semantic information beyond raw pixel-value in optical flow. Besides, the similarity measurement disentangles temporal relationships from domain-specific style properties, which helps regularize the temporal consistency without hurting style effects of cartoon images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our method is able to generate highly stylistic and temporal consistent cartoon videos."

As a compositional learning problem (human-verb-object), studying its generalization matters. However, widely-used metric mean average precision (mAP) fails to model the compositional generalization well. Thus, we propose a novel metric, mPD (mean Performance Degradation), as a complementary of mAP to evaluate the performance gap among compositions of different objects and the same verb. Surprisingly, mPD reveals that previous methods usually generalize poorly. With mPD as a cue, we propose Object Category (OC) Immunity to boost HOI generalization. The idea is to prevent model from learning spurious object-verb correlations as a short-cut to over-fit the train set. To achieve OC-immunity, we propose an OC-immune network that decouples the inputs from OC, extracts OC-immune representations, and leverages uncertainty quantification to generalize to unseen objects. In both conventional and zero-shot experiments, our method achieves decent improvements. To fully evaluate the generalization, we design a new and more difficult benchmark, on which we present significant advantage. The code is available at https://github.com/Foruck/OC-Immunity."

Then, we introduce our well-designed Double Flow Generator (DFG) framework to fuse features from learned vector flow and input image flow guaranteeing the spatial coherence of lines. Meanwhile, in order to allow for controllable character line drawing generation, we integrate a Line Control Matrix (LCM) into DFG and train a Line Control Regressor (LCR) to synthesize drawings with different styles by elaborately controlling the level of details, such as thickness, smoothness, and continuity, of lines. Finally, we design a Fourier Transformation Loss to further constrain the character line generation from the frequency domain view of the point.

We explore how to design a graph neural network specially for unsupervised multiview learning and integrate multiple graphs into a unified consensus graph by a shared self-attentional module. The view-shared self-attentional module utilizes the graph structure to learn a view-consistent global graph. Meanwhile, instead of using auto-encoder in most unsupervised learning graph neural networks, SDSNE uses a co-supervised strategy with structure information to supervise the model learning. The co-supervised strategy as the loss function guides SDSNE in achieving the stationary state. With the help of the loss and the self-attentional module, we learn to obtain a graph in which nodes in each connected component fully connect by the same weight. Experiments on several multiview datasets demonstrate effectiveness of SDSNE in terms of six clustering evaluation metrics."
857,aaai,2022,OVIS: Open-Vocabulary Visual Instance Search via Visual-Semantic Aligned Representation Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20070,"We introduce the task of open-vocabulary visual instance search (OVIS). Given an arbitrary textual search query, Open-vocabulary Visual Instance Search (OVIS) aims to return a ranked list of visual instances, i.e., image patches, that satisfies the search intent from an image database. The term ""open vocabulary"" means that there are neither restrictions to the visual instance to be searched nor restrictions to the word that can be used to compose the textual search query. We propose to address such a search challenge via visual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive image-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to learn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual instances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing us to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary textual query. To evaluate the performance of ViSA, we build two datasets named OVIS40 and OVIS1600 and also introduce a pipeline for error analysis. Through extensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to search for visual instances in images not available during training given a wide range of textual queries including those composed of uncommon words. Experimental results show that ViSA achieves an mAP@50 of 21.9% on OVIS40 under the most challenging setting and achieves an mAP@6 of 14.9% on OVIS1600 dataset."
858,aaai,2022,Feature Generation and Hypothesis Verification for Reliable Face Anti-spoofing,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20071,"Although existing face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods achieve high accuracy in intra-domain experiments, their effects drop severely in cross-domain scenarios because of poor generalization. Recently, multifarious techniques have been explored, such as domain generalization and representation disentanglement. However, the improvement is still limited by two issues: 1) It is difficult to perfectly map all faces to a shared feature space. If faces from unknown domains are not mapped to the known region in the shared feature space, accidentally inaccurate predictions will be obtained. 2) It is hard to completely consider various spoof traces for disentanglement. In this paper, we propose a Feature Generation and Hypothesis Verification framework to alleviate the two issues. Above all, feature generation networks which generate hypotheses of real faces and known attacks are introduced for the first time in the FAS task. Subsequently, two hypothesis verification modules are applied to judge whether the input face comes from the real-face space and the real-face distribution respectively. Furthermore, some analyses of the relationship between our framework and Bayesian uncertainty estimation are given, which provides theoretical support for reliable defense in unknown domains. Experimental results show our framework achieves promising results and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on extensive public datasets."

However, existing models cannot perform as well as humans, since sentences they produce are often implausible and grammatically incorrect. In this paper, inspired by the process of humans creating sentences, we propose a novel Knowledge-enhanced Commonsense Generation framework, termed KGR^4, consisting of four stages: Retrieval, Retrospect, Refine, Rethink. Under this framework, we first perform retrieval to search for relevant sentences from external corpus as the prototypes. Then, we train the generator that either edits or copies these prototypes to generate candidate sentences, of which potential errors will be fixed by an autoencoder-based refiner. Finally, we select the output sentence from candidate sentences produced by generators with different hyper-parameters. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on the CommonGen benchmark strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Particularly, KGR^4 obtains 33.56 SPICE points in the official leaderboard, outperforming the previously-reported best result by 2.49 SPICE points and achieving state-of-the-art performance."

However, information and knowledge evolve continuously, and temporal dynamics emerge, which are expected to influence future situations. In temporal knowledge graphs, time information is integrated into the graph by equipping each edge with a timestamp or a time range. Embedding-based methods have been introduced for link prediction on temporal knowledge graphs, but they mostly lack explainability and comprehensible reasoning chains. Particularly, they are usually not designed to deal with link forecasting -- event prediction involving future timestamps. We address the task of link forecasting on temporal knowledge graphs and introduce TLogic, an explainable framework that is based on temporal logical rules extracted via temporal random walks. We compare TLogic with state-of-the-art baselines on three benchmark datasets and show better overall performance while our method also provides explanations that preserve time consistency. Furthermore, in contrast to most state-of-the-art embedding-based methods, TLogic works well in the inductive setting where already learned rules are transferred to related datasets with a common vocabulary."

Existing methods mainly focus on fully supervised setting with temporal boundary labels for training, which, however, suffers expensive cost of annotation. In this work, we are dedicated to weakly supervised TLG, where multiple description sentences are given to an untrimmed video without temporal boundary labels. In this task, it is critical to learn a strong cross-modal semantic alignment between sentence semantics and visual content. To this end, we introduce a novel weakly supervised temporal adjacent network (WSTAN) for temporal language grounding. Specifically, WSTAN learns cross-modal semantic alignment by exploiting temporal adjacent network in a multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm, with a whole description paragraph as input. Moreover, we integrate a complementary branch into the framework, which explicitly refines the predictions with pseudo supervision from the MIL stage. An additional self-discriminating loss is devised on both the MIL branch and the complementary branch, aiming to enhance semantic discrimination by self-supervising. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets, \emph{i.e.}, ActivityNet-Captions, Charades-STA, and DiDeMo, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Though respectable works have made decent achievements in this task, they severely rely on abundant video-query paired data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we explore whether a video grounding model can be learned without any paired annotations. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work trying to address TVG in an unsupervised setting. Considering there is no paired supervision, we propose a novel Deep Semantic Clustering Network (DSCNet) to leverage all semantic information from the whole query set to compose the possible activity in each video for grounding. Specifically, we first develop a language semantic mining module, which extracts implicit semantic features from the whole query set. Then, these language semantic features serve as the guidance to compose the activity in video via a video-based semantic aggregation module. Finally, we utilize a foreground attention branch to filter out the redundant background activities and refine the grounding results. To validate the effectiveness of our DSCNet, we conduct experiments on both ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets. The results demonstrate that DSCNet achieves competitive performance, and even outperforms most weakly-supervised approaches."

However, conventional FL methods perform poorly due to the uniqueness of the task: broadcasting class centers among clients is crucial for recognition performances but leads to privacy leakage. To resolve the privacy-utility paradox, this work proposes PrivacyFace, a framework largely improves the federated learning face recognition via communicating auxiliary and privacy-agnostic information among clients. PrivacyFace mainly consists of two components: First, a practical Differentially Private Local Clustering (DPLC) mechanism is proposed to distill sanitized clusters from local class centers. Second, a consensus-aware recognition loss subsequently encourages global consensuses among clients, which ergo results in more discriminative features. The proposed framework is mathematically proved to be differentially private, introducing a lightweight overhead as well as yielding prominent performance boosts (\textit{e.g.}, +9.63\% and +10.26\% for TAR@FAR=1e-4 on IJB-B and IJB-C respectively). Extensive experiments and ablation studies on a large-scale dataset have demonstrated the efficacy and practicability of our method."

However, in real-world scenarios, audios are usually contaminated by off-screen sound and background noise. They will interfere with the procedure of identifying desired sources and building visual-sound connections, making previous studies non-applicable. In this work, we propose the Interference Eraser (IEr) framework, which tackles the problem of audio-visual sound source localization in the wild. The key idea is to eliminate the interference by redefining and carving discriminative audio representations. Specifically, we observe that the previous practice of learning only a single audio representation is insufficient due to the additive nature of audio signals. We thus extend the audio representation with our Audio-Instance-Identifier module, which clearly distinguishes sounding instances when audio signals of different volumes are unevenly mixed. Then we erase the influence of the audible but off-screen sounds and the silent but visible objects by a Cross-modal Referrer module with cross-modality distillation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior results on sound localization tasks, especially under real-world scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/alvinliu0/Visual-Sound-Localization-in-the-Wild."
865,aaai,2022,Exploring Motion and Appearance Information for Temporal Sentence Grounding,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20059,"Temporal sentence grounding aims to localize a target segment in an untrimmed video semantically according to a given sentence query. Most previous works focus on learning frame-level features of each whole frame in the entire video, and directly match them with the textual information. Such frame-level feature extraction leads to the obstacles of these methods in distinguishing ambiguous video frames with complicated contents and subtle appearance differences, thus limiting their performance. In order to differentiate fine-grained appearance similarities among consecutive frames, some state-of-the-art methods additionally employ a detection model like Faster R-CNN to obtain detailed object-level features in each frame for filtering out the redundant background contents. However, these methods suffer from missing motion analysis since the object detection module in Faster R-CNN lacks temporal modeling. To alleviate the above limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Motion- and Appearance-guided 3D Semantic Reasoning Network (MA3SRN), which incorporates optical-flow-guided motion-aware, detection-based appearance-aware, and 3D-aware object-level features to better reason the spatial-temporal object relations for accurately modelling the activity among consecutive frames. Specifically, we first develop three individual branches for motion, appearance, and 3D encoding separately to learn fine-grained motion-guided, appearance-guided, and 3D-aware object features, respectively. Then, both motion and appearance information from corresponding branches are associated to enhance the 3D-aware features for the final precise grounding. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets (ActivityNet Caption, Charades-STA and TACoS) demonstrate that the proposed MA3SRN model achieves a new state-of-the-art."

Some applications in heterogeneous graphs require explicit edge modeling, such as subgraph isomorphism counting and matching. However, existing message passing mechanisms are not designed well in theory. In this paper, we start from a particular edge-to-vertex transform and exploit the isomorphism property in the edge-to-vertex dual graphs. We prove that searching isomorphisms on the original graph is equivalent to searching on its dual graph. Based on this observation, we propose dual message passing neural networks (DMPNNs) to enhance the substructure representation learning in an asynchronous way for subgraph isomorphism counting and matching as well as unsupervised node classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robust performance of DMPNNs by combining both node and edge representation learning in synthetic and real heterogeneous graphs.

However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis."
868,aaai,2022,Learning Parameterized Task Structure for Generalization to Unseen Entities,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20718,"Real world tasks are hierarchical and compositional. Tasks can be composed of multiple subtasks (or sub-goals) that are dependent on each other. These subtasks are defined in terms of entities (e.g., ""apple"", ""pear"") that can be recombined to form new subtasks (e.g., ""pickup apple"", and ""pickup pear""). To solve these tasks efficiently, an agent must infer subtask dependencies (e.g. an agent must execute ""pickup apple"" before ""place apple in pot""), and generalize the inferred dependencies to new subtasks (e.g. ""place apple in pot"" is similar to ""place apple in pan""). Moreover, an agent may also need to solve unseen tasks, which can involve unseen entities. To this end, we formulate parameterized subtask graph inference (PSGI), a method for modeling subtask dependencies using first-order logic with subtask entities. To facilitate this, we learn entity attributes in a zero-shot manner, which are used as quantifiers (e.g. ""is_pickable(X)"") for the parameterized subtask graph. We show this approach accurately learns the latent structure on hierarchical and compositional tasks more efficiently than prior work, and show PSGI can generalize by modelling structure on subtasks unseen during adaptation."

Density estimators have been widely used for unsupervised anomaly detection. By the recent advance of deep learning, the density estimation performance has been greatly improved. However, the neural density estimators cannot exploit anomaly label information, which would be valuable for improving the anomaly detection performance. The proposed method effectively utilizes the anomaly label information by training the neural density estimator so that the likelihood of normal instances is maximized and the likelihood of anomalous instances is lower than that of the normal instances. We employ an autoregressive model for the neural density estimator, which enables us to calculate the likelihood exactly. With the experiments using 16 datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves the anomaly detection performance with a few labeled anomalous instances, and achieves better performance than existing unsupervised and supervised anomaly detection methods."
870,aaai,2022,Deep Graph Clustering via Dual Correlation Reduction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20726,"Deep graph clustering, which aims to reveal the underlying graph structure and divide the nodes into different groups, has attracted intensive attention in recent years. However, we observe that, in the process of node encoding, existing methods suffer from representation collapse which tends to map all data into the same representation. Consequently, the discriminative capability of the node representation is limited, leading to unsatisfied clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised deep graph clustering method termed Dual Correlation Reduction Network (DCRN) by reducing information correlation in a dual manner. Specifically, in our method, we first design a siamese network to encode samples. Then by forcing the cross-view sample correlation matrix and cross-view feature correlation matrix to approximate two identity matrices, respectively, we reduce the information correlation in the dual-level, thus improving the discriminative capability of the resulting features. Moreover, in order to alleviate representation collapse caused by over-smoothing in GCN, we introduce a propagation regularization term to enable the network to gain long-distance information with the shallow network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCRN against the existing state-of-the-art methods."
871,aaai,2022,Efficient One-Pass Multi-View Subspace Clustering with Consensus Anchors,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20723,"Although previous graph-based multi-view clustering algorithms have gained significant progress, most of them are still faced with three limitations. First, they often suffer from high computational complexity, which restricts their applications in large-scale scenarios. Second, they usually perform graph learning either at the single-view level or at the view-consensus level, but often neglect the possibility of the joint learning of single-view and consensus graphs. Third, many of them rely on the k-means for discretization of the spectral embeddings, which lack the ability to directly learn the graph with discrete cluster structure. In light of this, this paper presents an efficient multi-view clustering approach via unified and discrete bipartite graph learning (UDBGL). Specifically, the anchor-based subspace learning is incorporated to learn the view-specific bipartite graphs from multiple views, upon which the bipartite graph fusion is leveraged to learn a view-consensus bipartite graph with adaptive weight learning. Further, the Laplacian rank constraint is imposed to ensure that the fused bipartite graph has discrete cluster structures (with a specific number of connected components). By simultaneously formulating the view-specific bipartite graph learning, the view-consensus bipartite graph learning, and the discrete cluster structure learning into a unified objective function, an efficient minimization algorithm is then designed to tackle this optimization problem and directly achieve a discrete clustering solution without requiring additional partitioning, which notably has linear time complexity in data size. Experiments on a variety of multi-view datasets demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our UDBGL approach. The code is available at https://github.com/huangdonghere/UDBGL."

Thus training a robust recognition model requires a large amount of data to cover diversity as much as possible. In contrast to data collection and annotation, data augmentation is a low cost way. In this paper, we propose a new method for text image augmentation. Different from traditional augmentation methods such as rotation, scaling and perspective transformation, our proposed augmentation method is designed to learn proper and efficient data augmentation which is more effective and specific for training a robust recognizer. By using a set of custom fiducial points, the proposed augmentation method is flexible and controllable. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between the isolated processes of data augmentation and network optimization by joint learning. An agent network learns from the output of the recognition network and controls the fiducial points to generate more proper training samples for the recognition network. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including regular scene text, irregular scene text and handwritten text, show that the proposed augmentation and the joint learning methods significantly boost the performance of the recognition networks. A general toolkit for geometric augmentation is available."

However, due to the growing privacy awareness, it is prohibited to access the face images on user devices to continually improve face recognition models. Federated Learning (FL) is a technique to address the privacy issue, which can collaboratively optimize the model without sharing the data between clients. In this work, we propose a FL based framework called FedFR to improve the generic face representation in a privacy-aware manner. Besides, the framework jointly optimizes personalized models for the corresponding clients via the proposed Decoupled Feature Customization module. The client-specific personalized model can serve the need of optimized face recognition experience for registered identities at the local device. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the personalized face recognition in FL setup. The proposed framework is validated to be superior to previous approaches on several generic and personalized face recognition benchmarks with diverse FL scenarios.

Considering such perceptually-specific goals, the frontier of deep reinforcement learning research is to learn a goal-conditioned policy without hand-crafted rewards. To learn this kind of policy, recent works usually take as the reward the non-parametric distance to a given goal in an explicit embedding space. From a different viewpoint, we propose a novel unsupervised learning approach named goal-conditioned policy with intrinsic motivation (GPIM), which jointly learns both an abstract-level policy and a goal-conditioned policy. The abstract-level policy is conditioned on a latent variable to optimize a discriminator and discovers diverse states that are further rendered into perceptually-specific goals for the goal-conditioned policy. The learned discriminator serves as an intrinsic reward function for the goal-conditioned policy to imitate the trajectory induced by the abstract-level policy. Experiments on various robotic tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GPIM method which substantially outperforms prior techniques."

This inconsistency is known as the doctrinal paradox, which plays a central role in the field of judgment aggregation. Despite a large body of literature on the worst-case analysis of the doctrinal paradox, little is known about its likelihood under natural statistical models, except for a few i.i.d. distributions [List, 2005].   In this paper, we characterize the likelihood of the doctrinal paradox under a much more general and realistic model called the smoothed social choice framework [Xia, 2020b], where agents' ground truth judgments are arbitrarily correlated while the noises are independent. Our main theorem states that under mild conditions, the smoothed likelihood of the doctrinal paradox is either $0$, $\exp(-\Theta(n))$, $\Theta(n^{-1/2})$ or $\Theta(1)$. This not only answers open questions by List [2005] for i.i.d. distributions but also draws clear lines between situations with frequent and with vanishing paradoxes."

We consider a scenario in which an agent requests recommendations from multiple parties to build trust toward another agent. At the collection level, we propose to allow agents to self-assess the accuracy of their recommendations and autonomously decide on whether they would participate in the recommendation process or not. At the processing level, we propose a recommendations aggregation technique that is resilient to collusion attacks, followed by a credibility update mechanism for the participating agents. The originality of our work stems from its consideration of dishonest opinions at both the collection and processing levels, which allows for better and more persistent protection against dishonest recommenders. Experiments conducted on the Epinions dataset show that our solution yields better performance in protecting the recommendation process against Sybil attacks, in comparison with a competing model that derives the optimal network of advisors based on the agents' trust values."

Many efforts focus on the feature extraction and similarity measurement of the matching cost computation step while less attention is paid on cost aggregation which is crucial for stereo matching. In this paper, we present a learning-based cost aggregation method for stereo matching by a novel sub-architecture in the end-to-end trainable pipeline. We reformulate the cost aggregation as a learning process of the generation and selection of cost aggregation proposals which indicate the possible cost aggregation results. The cost aggregation sub-architecture is realized by a two-stream network: one for the generation of cost aggregation proposals, the other for the selection of the proposals. The criterion for the selection is determined by the low-level structure information obtained from a light convolutional network. The two-stream network offers a global view guidance for the cost aggregation to rectify the mismatching value stemming from the limited view of the matching cost computation. The comprehensive experiments on challenge datasets such as KITTI and Scene Flow show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

For zero-shot image restoration, we design a novel model, termed SiamTrans, which is constructed by Siamese transformers, encoders, and decoders. Each transformer has a temporal attention layer and several self-attention layers, to capture both temporal and spatial information of multiple frames.

SNNs are seen as hypothetical solutions for the bottlenecks of ANNs in pattern recognition, such as energy efficiency. But current methods such as ANN-to-SNN conversion and back-propagation do not take full advantage of these networks, and unsupervised methods have not yet reached a success comparable to advanced artificial neural networks. It is important to study the behavior of SNNs trained with unsupervised learning methods such as spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on video classification tasks, including mechanisms to model motion information using spikes, as this information is critical for video understanding. This paper presents multiple methods of transposing temporal information into a static format, and then transforming the visual information into spikes using latency coding. These methods are paired with two types of temporal fusion known as early and late fusion, and are used to help the spiking neural network in capturing the spatio-temporal features from videos. In this paper, we rely on the network architecture of a convolutional spiking neural network trained with STDP, and we test the performance of this network when challenged with action recognition tasks. Understanding how a spiking neural network responds to different methods of movement extraction and representation can help reduce the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs. In this paper we show the effect of the similarity in the shape and speed of certain actions on action recognition with spiking neural networks, we also highlight the effectiveness of some methods compared to others."

We show that reward shifting in the form of the linear transformation is equivalent to changing the initialization of the $Q$-function in function approximation. Based on such an equivalence, we bring the key insight that a positive reward shifting leads to conservative exploitation, while a negative reward shifting leads to curiosity-driven exploration. Accordingly, conservative exploitation improves offline RL value estimation, and optimistic value estimation improves exploration for online RL. We validate our insight on a range of RL tasks and show its improvement over baselines: (1) In offline RL, the conservative exploitation leads to improved performance based on off-the-shelf algorithms; (2) In online continuous control, multiple value functions with different shifting constants can be used to tackle the exploration-exploitation dilemma for better sample efficiency; (3) In discrete control tasks, a negative reward shifting yields an improvement over the curiosity-based exploration method."

However, such methods often focus on the syntax and consider only one single perspective of programs, limiting the representation power of models. This paper proposes a multi-view graph (MVG) program representation method. MVG pays more attention to code semantics and simultaneously includes both data flow and control flow as multiple views. These views are then combined and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) to obtain a comprehensive program representation that covers various aspects. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed MVG approach in the context of algorithm detection, an important and challenging subfield of PLP. Specifically, we use a public dataset POJ-104 and also construct a new challenging dataset ALG-109 to test our method. In experiments, MVG outperforms previous methods significantly, demonstrating our model's strong capability of representing source code."

The platform allows multiple users to work on a corpus of documents. The tool enables to tag a corpus of documents through an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface that adopts the Extensible Markup Language (XML) as output format. The main goal of the application is two-fold: facilitating the tagging process and reducing or avoiding for errors in the output documents. Moreover, it allows to identify arguments and other entities that are used to build an arguments graph. It is also possible to assess the level of agreement of annotators working on a corpus of text."
885,aaai,2022,Sample-Efficient Iterative Lower Bound Optimization of Deep Reactive Policies for Planning in Continuous MDPs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21220,"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled optimization of deep reactive policies (DRPs) for continuous MDP planning by encoding a parametric policy as a deep neural network and exploiting automatic differentiation in an end-to-end model-based gradient descent framework. This approach has proven effective for optimizing DRPs in nonlinear continuous MDPs, but it requires a large number of sampled trajectories to learn effectively and can suffer from high variance in solution quality. In this work, we revisit the overall model-based DRP objective and instead take a minorization-maximization perspective to iteratively optimize the DRP w.r.t. a locally tight lower-bounded objective. This novel formulation of DRP learning as iterative lower bound optimization (ILBO) is particularly appealing because (i) each step is structurally easier to optimize than the overall objective, (ii) it guarantees a monotonically improving objective under certain theoretical conditions, and (iii) it reuses samples between iterations thus lowering sample complexity. Empirical evaluation confirms that ILBO is significantly more sample-efficient than the state-of-the-art DRP planner and consistently produces better solution quality with lower variance. We additionally demonstrate that ILBO generalizes well to new problem instances (i.e., different initial states) without requiring retraining."
886,aaai,2022,Frozen Pretrained Transformers as Universal Computation Engines,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20729,"We investigate the capability of a transformer pretrained on natural language to generalize to other modalities with minimal finetuning -- in particular, without finetuning of the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks. We consider such a model, which we call a Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), and study finetuning it on a variety of sequence classification tasks spanning numerical computation, vision, and protein fold prediction. In contrast to prior works which investigate finetuning on the same modality as the pretraining dataset, we show that pretraining on natural language can improve performance and compute efficiency on non-language downstream tasks. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the architecture, comparing the performance of a random initialized transformer to a random LSTM. Combining the two insights, we find language-pretrained transformers can obtain strong performance on a variety of non-language tasks."
887,aaai,2022,Context-Aware Health Event Prediction via Transition Functions on Dynamic Disease Graphs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i4.20380,"With the wide application of electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare facilities, health event prediction with deep learning has gained more and more attention. A common feature of EHR data used for deep-learning-based predictions is historical diagnoses. Existing work mainly regards a diagnosis as an independent disease and does not consider clinical relations among diseases in a visit. Many machine learning approaches assume disease representations are static in different visits of a patient. However, in real practice, multiple diseases that are frequently diagnosed at the same time reflect hidden patterns that are conducive to prognosis. Moreover, the development of a disease is not static since some diseases can emerge or disappear and show various symptoms in different visits of a patient. To effectively utilize this combinational disease information and explore the dynamics of diseases, we propose a novel context-aware learning framework using transition functions on dynamic disease graphs. Specifically, we construct a global disease co-occurrence graph with multiple node properties for disease combinations. We design dynamic subgraphs for each patient's visit to leverage global and local contexts. We further define three diagnosis roles in each visit based on the variation of node properties to model disease transition processes. Experimental results on two real-world EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state of the art in predicting health events."

This new method is then used to describe the ""Nontransitive Identities"" (NI) that are possible for 3 dice with 3, 4 and 5 sides each as well as for 5 dice with 3 sides each. Next, we will discuss how these NI can be used to create NI that involve more dice and/or die sides. From there, the 3 dice Nontransitive Identities (NI) will be used to produce 5 dice NI. We will begin this by describing more nomenclature that becomes necessary for characterizing sets of NI with multiple win chains. Then, we will describe a method for creating 5 dice NI and 7 dice NI from our 3 dice NI. We will conclude with a discussion on the patterns that exist in the frequency of nontransitive identities and how these patterns correlate to NI morphisms. Our ancillary files will include our python scripts as well as all of the sets of Nontransitive identities we have discussed."
889,aaai,2022,Fair Conformal Predictors for Applications in Medical Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21459,"Deep learning has the potential to automate many clinically useful tasks in medical imaging. However translation of deep learning into clinical practice has been hindered by issues such as lack of the transparency and interpretability in these ""black box"" algorithms compared to traditional statistical methods. Specifically, many clinical deep learning models lack rigorous and robust techniques for conveying certainty (or lack thereof) in their predictions -- ultimately limiting their appeal for extensive use in medical decision-making. Furthermore, numerous demonstrations of algorithmic bias have increased hesitancy towards deployment of deep learning for clinical applications. To this end, we explore how conformal predictions can complement existing deep learning approaches by providing an intuitive way of expressing uncertainty while facilitating greater transparency to clinical users. In this paper, we conduct field interviews with radiologists to assess possible use-cases for conformal predictors. Using insights gathered from these interviews, we devise two clinical use-cases and empirically evaluate several methods of conformal predictions on a dermatology photography dataset for skin lesion classification. We show how to modify conformal predictions to be more adaptive to subgroup differences in patient skin tones through equalized coverage. Finally, we compare conformal prediction against measures of epistemic uncertainty."

One way to ensure high-quality generation is to use multiple sources with complementary information such as different views of the same object. However, as source images are often misaligned due to the large disparities among the camera settings, strong assumptions have been made in the past with respect to the camera(s) or/and the object in interest, limiting the application of such techniques. Therefore, we propose a new general approach which models multiple types of variations among sources, such as view angles, poses, facial expressions, in a unified framework, so that it can be employed on datasets of vastly different nature. We verify our approach on a variety of data including humans bodies, faces, city scenes and 3D objects. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the better performance of our method than the state of the art."

Besides recognizing predefined classes, the system needs to reject the unknowns. Prototype learning is a potential manner to handle the problem, as its ability to improve intra-class compactness of representations is much needed in discrimination between the known and the unknowns. In this work, we propose a novel Prototype Mining And Learning (PMAL) framework. It has a prototype mining mechanism before the phase of optimizing embedding space, explicitly considering two crucial properties, namely high-quality and diversity of the prototype set. Concretely, a set of high-quality candidates are firstly extracted from training samples based on data uncertainty learning, avoiding the interference from unexpected noise. Considering the multifarious appearance of objects even in a single category, a diversity-based strategy for prototype set filtering is proposed. Accordingly, the embedding space can be better optimized to discriminate therein the predefined classes and between known and unknowns. Extensive experiments verify the two good characteristics (i.e., high-quality and diversity) embraced in prototype mining, and show the remarkable performance of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-arts."

Leveraging statistical topic modelling helps researchers and practitioners in better comprehension of textual content as well as provides useful information for further analysis. Statistical topic modelling becomes especially important when we work with large volumes of dynamic text, e.g., Facebook or Twitter datasets. In this study, we summarize the message content of four data sets of Twitter messages relating to challenging social events in Kenya. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling to analyze the content. Our study uses two evaluation measures, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and topic coherence analysis, to select the best LDA models. The obtained LDA results show that the tool can be effectively used to extract discussion topics and summarize them for further manual analysis"
893,aaai,2022,Barely-Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised Learning with Very Few Labeled Images,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20082,"Graph-based semi-supervised learning has been shown to be one of the most effective approaches for classification tasks from a wide range of domains, such as image classification and text classification, as they can exploit the connectivity patterns between labeled and unlabeled samples to improve learning performance. In this work, we advance this effective learning paradigm towards a scenario where labeled data are severely limited. More specifically, we address the problem of graph-based semi-supervised learning in the presence of severely limited labeled samples, and propose a new framework, called {\em Shoestring}, that improves the learning performance through semantic transfer from these very few labeled samples to large numbers of unlabeled samples.   In particular, our framework learns a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing the similarity to centroid embedding of each class. {\em Shoestring} is trained in an end-to-end fashion to learn to leverage the semantic knowledge of limited labeled samples as well as their connectivity patterns with large numbers of unlabeled samples simultaneously. By combining {\em Shoestring} with graph convolutional networks, label propagation and their recent label-efficient variations (IGCN and GLP), we are able to achieve state-of-the-art node classification performance in the presence of very few labeled samples. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on image classification tasks in the few-shot learning regime, with significant gains on miniImageNet ($2.57\%\sim3.59\%$) and tieredImageNet ($1.05\%\sim2.70\%$)."

The focal point of the course is a group project based on reproducing existing FACT-AI algorithms from top AI conferences and writing a corresponding report. In the first iteration of the course, we created an open source repository with the code implementations from the group projects. In the second iteration, we encouraged students to submit their group projects to the Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge, resulting in 9 reports from our course being accepted for publication in the ReScience journal. We reflect on our experience teaching the course over two years, where one year coincided with a global pandemic, and propose guidelines for teaching FACT-AI through reproducibility in graduate-level AI study programs. We hope this can be a useful resource for instructors who want to set up similar courses in the future."

Counterfactual explanations can help users understand not only why ML models make certain decisions, but also how these decisions can be changed. We frame the problem of finding counterfactual explanations as a gradient-based optimization task and extend previous work that could only be applied to differentiable models. In order to accommodate non-differentiable models such as tree ensembles, we use probabilistic model approximations in the optimization framework. We introduce an approximation technique that is effective for finding counterfactual explanations for predictions of the original model and show that our counterfactual examples are significantly closer to the original instances than those produced by other methods specifically designed for tree ensembles."

An analogous teacher agent is self-training to generate tasks of suitable relevance and difficulty for the learner. This allows leveraging minimal amounts of domain knowledge to tackle problems for which training data is unavailable or hard to synthesize. As a specific illustration, we consider loop invariant synthesis for imperative programs and use neural networks to refine both the teacher and solver strategies."
897,aaai,2022,Stochastic Planner-Actor-Critic for Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20086,"Unsupervised deep-learning (DL) models were recently proposed for deformable image registration tasks. In such models, a neural-network is trained to predict the best deformation field by minimizing some dissimilarity function between the moving and the target images. After training on a dataset without reference deformation fields available, such a model can be used to rapidly predict the deformation field between newly seen moving and target images. Currently, the training process effectively provides a point-estimate of the network weights rather than characterizing their entire posterior distribution. This may result in a potential over-fitting which may yield sub-optimal results at inference phase, especially for small-size datasets, frequently present in the medical imaging domain. We introduce a fully Bayesian framework for unsupervised DL-based deformable image registration. Our method provides a principled way to characterize the true posterior distribution, thus, avoiding potential over-fitting. We used stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to conduct the posterior sampling, which is both theoretically well-founded and computationally efficient. We demonstrated the added-value of our Basyesian unsupervised DL-based registration framework on the MNIST and brain MRI (MGH10) datasets in comparison to the VoxelMorph unsupervised DL-based image registration framework. Our experiments show that our approach provided better estimates of the deformation field by means of improved mean-squared-error ($0.0063$ vs. $0.0065$) and Dice coefficient ($0.73$ vs. $0.71$) for the MNIST and the MGH10 datasets respectively. Further, our approach provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the deformation-field by characterizing the true posterior distribution."
898,aaai,2022,Adapt to Environment Sudden Changes by Learning a Context Sensitive Policy,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20730,"Open-world novelty--a sudden change in the mechanics or properties of an environment--is a common occurrence in the real world. Novelty adaptation is an agent's ability to improve its policy performance post-novelty. Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume that the world is a closed, fixed process. Consequentially, RL policies adapt inefficiently to novelties. To address this, we introduce WorldCloner, an end-to-end trainable neuro-symbolic world model for rapid novelty adaptation. WorldCloner learns an efficient symbolic representation of the pre-novelty environment transitions, and uses this transition model to detect novelty and efficiently adapt to novelty in a single-shot fashion. Additionally, WorldCloner augments the policy learning process using imagination-based adaptation, where the world model simulates transitions of the post-novelty environment to help the policy adapt. By blending ''imagined'' transitions with interactions in the post-novelty environment, performance can be recovered with fewer total environment interactions. Using environments designed for studying novelty in sequential decision-making problems, we show that the symbolic world model helps its neural policy adapt more efficiently than model-based and model-based neural-only reinforcement learning methods."

We use propositional SAT-solving techniques to construct a transition system for the input LTLf formula; satisfiability checking is then reduced to a path-search problem over this transition system. Furthermore, we introduce CDLSC (Conflict-Driven LTLf Satisfiability Checking), a novel algorithm that leverages information produced by propositional SAT solvers from both satisfiability and unsatisfiability results. Experimental evaluations show that CDLSC outperforms all other existing approaches for LTLf satisfiability checking, by demonstrating an approximate four-fold speedup compared to the second-best solver."

So far, our understanding of the learning behavior of DNNs trained by noisy segmentation labels remains limited. In this study, we address this deficiency in both binary segmentation of biological microscopy images and multi-class segmentation of natural images. We generate extremely noisy labels by randomly sampling a small fraction (e.g., 10%) or flipping a large fraction (e.g., 90%) of the ground truth labels. When trained with these noisy labels, DNNs provide largely the same segmentation performance as trained by the original ground truth. This indicates that DNNs learn structures hidden in labels rather than pixel-level labels per se in their supervised training for semantic segmentation. We refer to these hidden structures in labels as meta-structures. When DNNs are trained by labels with different perturbations to the meta-structure, we find consistent degradation in their segmentation performance. In contrast, incorporation of meta-structure information substantially improves performance of an unsupervised segmentation model developed for binary semantic segmentation. We define meta-structures mathematically as spatial density distributions and show both theoretically and experimentally how this formulation explains key observed learning behavior of DNNs."

IR serve an important function in the biomedical domain, where content and sources of scientific knowledge may evolve rapidly. Although neural retrievers have surpassed traditional IR approaches such as TF-IDF and BM25 in standard open-domain question answering tasks, they are still found lacking in the biomedical domain. In this paper, we seek to improve information retrieval (IR) using neural retrievers (NR) in the biomedical domain, and achieve this goal using a three-pronged approach. First, to tackle the relative lack of data in the biomedical domain, we propose a template-based question generation method that can be leveraged to train neural retriever models. Second, we develop two novel pre-training tasks that are closely aligned to the downstream task of information retrieval. Third, we introduce the ``Poly-DPR'' model which encodes each context into multiple context vectors. Extensive experiments and analysis on the BioASQ challenge suggest that our proposed method leads to large gains over existing neural approaches and beats BM25 in the small-corpus setting. We show that BM25 and our method can complement each other, and a simple hybrid model leads to further gains in the large corpus setting."

In recent work, however, Carlini et al. show that it is possible to reconstruct private images from the encrypted dataset generated by InstaHide. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that Carlini et al.'s attack can be easily defeated by incorporating data augmentation into InstaHide. This leads to a natural question: is InstaHide with data augmentation secure? In this paper, we provide a negative answer to this question, by devising an attack for recovering private images from the outputs of InstaHide even when data augmentation is present. The basic idea is to use a comparative network to identify encrypted images that are likely to correspond to the same private image, and then employ a fusion-denoising network for restoring the private image from the encrypted ones, taking into account the effects of data augmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack in comparison to Carlini et al.'s attack."
903,aaai,2022,Learning Optical Flow with Adaptive Graph Reasoning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20083,"Estimating per-pixel motion between video frames, known as optical flow, is a long-standing problem in video understanding and analysis. Most contemporary optical flow techniques largely focus on addressing the cross-image matching with feature similarity, with few methods considering how to explicitly reason over the given scene for achieving a holistic motion understanding. In this work, taking a fresh perspective, we introduce a novel graph-based approach, called adaptive graph reasoning for optical flow (AGFlow), to emphasize the value of scene/context information in optical flow. Our key idea is to decouple the context reasoning from the matching procedure, and exploit scene information to effectively assist motion estimation by learning to reason over the adaptive graph. The proposed AGFlow can effectively exploit the context information and incorporate it within the matching procedure, producing more robust and accurate results. On both Sintel clean and final passes, our AGFlow achieves the best accuracy with EPE of 1.43 and 2.47 pixels, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches by 11.2% and 13.6%, respectively."

Due to its exponential time complexity, many heuristic methods have been proposed which can return a good-quality solution in a reasonable time. However, most of the heuristic algorithms are memoryless and unable to utilize the experience during the search. Inspired by the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a novel perturbation mechanism named BLP, which can learn online to select a good vertex for perturbation when getting stuck in local optima. To our best of knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine local search with RL for the maximum $ k $-plex problem.   Besides, we also propose a novel strategy, named Dynamic-threshold Configuration Checking (DTCC), which extends the original Configuration Checking (CC) strategy from two aspects.   Based on the BLP and DTCC, we develop a local search algorithm named BDCC and improve it by a hyperheuristic strategy. The experimental result shows that our algorithms dominate on the standard DIMACS and BHOSLIB benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on massive graphs."

We show in a representation theorem that a revision operator satisfying our postulates can be represented by a pre-order on interpretations of the beliefs, together with a selection function for the intentions."

Previous Creative AI curricula mainly focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) while paying less attention to Autoregressive Models, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or other generative models, which have since become common in the field of generative AI. VAEs' latent-space structure and interpolation ability could effectively ground the interdisciplinary learning of AI, creative arts, and philosophy. Thus, we designed a lesson to teach high school students about VAEs. We developed a web-based game and used Plato's cave, a philosophical metaphor, to introduce how VAEs work. We used a Google Colab notebook for students to re-train VAEs with their hand-written digits to consolidate their understandings. Finally, we guided the exploration of creative VAE tools such as SketchRNN and MusicVAE to draw the connection between what they learned and real-world applications. This paper describes the lesson design and shares insights from the pilot studies with 22 students. We found that our approach was effective in teaching students about a novel AI concept."

In particular, actor-critic methods with a centralized critic and decentralized actors are a common instance of this idea. However, the implications of using a centralized critic in this context are not fully discussed and understood even though it is the standard choice of many algorithms. We therefore formally analyze centralized and decentralized critic approaches, providing a deeper understanding of the implications of critic choice. Because our theory makes unrealistic assumptions, we also empirically compare the centralized and decentralized critic methods over a wide set of environments to validate our theories and to provide practical advice. We show that there exist misconceptions regarding centralized critics in the current literature and show that the centralized critic design is not strictly beneficial, but rather both centralized and decentralized critics have different pros and cons that should be taken into account by algorithm designers."

However, MTL research faces two challenges: 1) effectively modeling the relationships between tasks to enable knowledge sharing, and 2) jointly learning task-specific and shared knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel model called Adaptive Task-to-Task Fusion Network (AdaTT) to address both challenges. AdaTT is a deep fusion network built with task-specific and optional shared fusion units at multiple levels. By leveraging a residual mechanism and a gating mechanism for task-to-task fusion, these units adaptively learn both shared knowledge and task-specific knowledge. To evaluate AdaTT's performance, we conduct experiments on a public benchmark and an industrial recommendation dataset using various task groups. Results demonstrate AdaTT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our end-to-end experiments reveal that the model exhibits better performance compared to alternatives."

In this paper, we introduce the Parametric Control Barrier Function (Parametric-CBF), a novel variant of the traditional Control Barrier Function to extend its expressivity in describing different safe behaviors among heterogeneous robots. Instead of assuming cooperative and homogeneous robots using the same safe controllers, the ego robot is able to model the neighboring robots' underlying safe controllers through different Parametric-CBFs with observed data. Given learned parametric-CBF and proved forward invariance, it provides greater flexibility for the ego robot to better coordinate with other heterogeneous robots with improved efficiency while enjoying formally provable safety guarantees. We demonstrate the usage of Parametric-CBF in behavior prediction and adaptive safe control in the ramp merging scenario from the applications of autonomous driving. Compared to traditional CBF, Parametric-CBF has the advantage of capturing varying drivers' characteristics given richer description of robot behavior in the context of safe control. Numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Current value estimation methods, such as DDPG and TD3, suffer from unnecessary over- or underestimation bias. In this paper, we explore the potential of double actors, which has been neglected for a long time, for better value function estimation in continuous setting. First, we uncover and demonstrate the bias alleviation property of double actors by building double actors upon single critic and double critics to handle overestimation bias in DDPG and underestimation bias in TD3 respectively. Next, we interestingly find that double actors help improve the exploration ability of the agent. Finally, to mitigate the uncertainty of value estimate from double critics, we further propose to regularize the critic networks under double actors architecture, which gives rise to Double Actors Regularized Critics (DARC) algorithm. Extensive experimental results on challenging continuous control tasks show that DARC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with higher sample efficiency."

Although the theory has been applied successfully in models and in experiments for many complex systems such as for tipping in climate systems, there are ongoing debates, when warning signs can be extracted from data. In this work, we shed light on this debate by considering different types of underlying noise. Thereby, we significantly advance the general theory of warning signs for nonlinear stochastic dynamics. A key scenario deals with stochastic systems approaching a bifurcation point dynamically upon slow parameter variation. The stochastic fluctuations are generically able to probe the dynamics near a deterministic attractor to reveal critical slowing down. Using scaling laws near bifurcations, one can then anticipate the distance to a bifurcation. Previous warning signs results assume that the noise is Markovian, most often even white. Here, we study warning signs for non-Markovian systems including coloured noise and $\alpha$-regular Volterra processes (of which fractional Brownian motion and the Rosenblatt process are special cases). We prove that early warning scaling laws can disappear completely or drastically change their exponent based upon the parameters controlling the noise process. This provides a clear explanation, why applying standard warning signs results to reduced models of complex systems may not agree with data-driven studies. We demonstrate our results numerically in the context of a box model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)."
912,aaai,2022,Sharp Restricted Isometry Property Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Recovery Problems with Corrupted Measurements,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20734,"In this paper, we study a general low-rank matrix recovery problem with linear measurements corrupted by some noise. The objective is to understand under what conditions on the restricted isometry property (RIP) of the problem local search methods can find the ground truth with a small error. By analyzing the landscape of the non-convex problem, we first propose a global guarantee on the maximum distance between an arbitrary local minimizer and the ground truth under the assumption that the RIP constant is smaller than $1/2$. We show that this distance shrinks to zero as the intensity of the noise reduces. Our new guarantee is sharp in terms of the RIP constant and is much stronger than the existing results. We then present a local guarantee for problems with an arbitrary RIP constant, which states that any local minimizer is either considerably close to the ground truth or far away from it. Next, we prove the strict saddle property, which guarantees the global convergence of the perturbed gradient descent method in polynomial time. The developed results demonstrate how the noise intensity and the RIP constant of the problem affect the landscape of the problem."

Unlike most symbolization procedures, ASTRIDE is adaptive during both the segmentation step by performing change-point detection and the quantization step by using quantiles. Instead of proceeding signal by signal, ASTRIDE builds a dictionary of symbols that is common to all signals in a data set. We also introduce D-GED (Dynamic General Edit Distance), a novel similarity measure on symbolic representations based on the general edit distance. We demonstrate the performance of the ASTRIDE and FASTRIDE representations compared to SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation), 1d-SAX, SFA (Symbolic Fourier Approximation), and ABBA (Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Aggregation) on reconstruction and, when applicable, on classification tasks. These algorithms are evaluated on 86 univariate equal-size data sets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. An open source GitHub repository called astride is made available to reproduce all the experiments in Python."

However, in scenarios requiring complex interactions, existing algorithms can suffer from an inability to accurately anticipate the influence of self-actions on other agents. Incorporating an ability to reason about other agents' potential responses can allow an agent to formulate more effective strategies. This paper adopts a recursive reasoning model in a centralized-training-decentralized-execution framework to help learning agents better cooperate with or compete against others. The proposed algorithm, referred to as the Recursive Reasoning Graph (R2G), shows state-of-the-art performance on multiple multi-agent particle and robotics games."

These models achieve the current state of the art, but they have difficulties generalizing when applied to data that deviate from the training distribution. Recent work has shown that it is possible to train denoisers on a single noisy image. These models adapt to the features of the test image, but their performance is limited by the small amount of information used to train them. Here we propose ""GainTuning"", in which CNN models pre-trained on large datasets are adaptively and selectively adjusted for individual test images. To avoid overfitting, GainTuning optimizes a single multiplicative scaling parameter (the ""Gain"") of each channel in the convolutional layers of the CNN. We show that GainTuning improves state-of-the-art CNNs on standard image-denoising benchmarks, boosting their denoising performance on nearly every image in a held-out test set. These adaptive improvements are even more substantial for test images differing systematically from the training data, either in noise level or image type. We illustrate the potential of adaptive denoising in a scientific application, in which a CNN is trained on synthetic data, and tested on real transmission-electron-microscope images. In contrast to the existing methodology, GainTuning is able to faithfully reconstruct the structure of catalytic nanoparticles from these data at extremely low signal-to-noise ratios."

However, most approaches compromise accuracy to mitigate jitter or do not sufficiently comprehend the temporal aspects of human motion. Furthermore, occlusion increases uncertainty between consecutive frames, which results in unsmooth results. To address these issues, we design an architecture that exploits the keypoint kinematic features with the following components. First, we effectively capture the temporal features by leveraging individual keypoint's velocity and acceleration. Second, the proposed hierarchical transformer encoder aggregates spatio-temporal dependencies and refines the 2D or 3D input pose estimated from existing estimators. Finally, we provide an online cross-supervision between the refined input pose generated from the encoder and the final pose from our decoder to enable joint optimization. We demonstrate comprehensive results and validate the effectiveness of our model in various tasks: 2D pose estimation, 3D pose estimation, body mesh recovery, and sparsely annotated multi-human pose estimation.

Model-based RL algorithms hold promise for reducing unsafe real-world actions: they may synthesize policies that obey all constraints using simulated samples from a learned model. However, imperfect models can result in real-world constraint violations even for actions that are predicted to satisfy all constraints. We propose Conservative and Adaptive Penalty (CAP), a model-based safe RL framework that accounts for potential modeling errors by capturing model uncertainty and adaptively exploiting it to balance the reward and the cost objectives. First, CAP inflates predicted costs using an uncertainty-based penalty. Theoretically, we show that policies that satisfy this conservative cost constraint are guaranteed to also be feasible in the true environment. We further show that this guarantees the safety of all intermediate solutions during RL training. Further, CAP adaptively tunes this penalty during training using true cost feedback from the environment. We evaluate this conservative and adaptive penalty-based approach for model-based safe RL extensively on state and image-based environments. Our results demonstrate substantial gains in sample-efficiency while incurring fewer violations than prior safe RL algorithms. Code is available at: https://github.com/Redrew/CAP"

Our algorithm is few-shot: Given about a dozen images restored by the model, it can significantly improve the perceptual quality and/or the MSE of the model for newly restored images without further training. Our approach is motivated by a recent theoretical result that links between the minimum MSE (MMSE) predictor and the predictor that minimizes the MSE under a perfect perceptual quality constraint. Specifically, it has been shown that the latter can be obtained by optimally transporting the output of the former, such that its distribution matches the source data. Thus, to improve the perceptual quality of a predictor that was originally trained to minimize MSE, we approximate the optimal transport by a linear transformation in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder, which we compute in closed-form using empirical means and covariances. Going beyond the theory, we find that applying the same procedure on models that were initially trained to achieve high perceptual quality, typically improves their perceptual quality even further. And by interpolating the results with the original output of the model, we can improve their MSE on the expense of perceptual quality. We illustrate our method on a variety of degradations applied to general content images of arbitrary dimensions."

Equations defining static quantal response equilibria (QRE) for binary choice games on graphs with arbitrary topology and noise distribution are written. It is shown that in the special cases of complete graph and arbitrary noise distribution, and circular and star topology and logistic noise distribution the resulting equations can be cast in the form coinciding with that derived in the earlier literature. Explicit equations QRE for non-directed graphs in the annealed approximation are derived. It is shown that the resulting effect on the phase transition is the same as found in the literature on phase transition in the Ising model on graphs in the same approximation.Evolutionary noisy binary choice game having the earlier described QRE as its stationary equilibria in the mean field approximation is constructed using the formalism of master equation."

We show that this notion is problematic in the context of NLP as it considers a narrow spectrum of linguistic phenomena. In this paper, we argue for semantic robustness, which is better aligned with the human concept of linguistic fidelity. We characterize semantic robustness in terms of biases that it is expected to induce in a model. We study semantic robustness of a range of vanilla and robustly trained architectures using a template-based generative test bed. We complement the analysis with empirical evidence that, despite being harder to implement, semantic robustness can improve performance %gives guarantees for on complex linguistic phenomena where models robust in the classical sense fail."

The normative question of what AI for social good research should be ""for"" is not thoughtfully elaborated, or is frequently addressed with a utilitarian outlook that prioritizes the needs of the majority over those who have been historically marginalized, brushing aside realities of injustice and inequity. We argue that AI for social good ought to be assessed by the communities that the AI system will impact, using as a guide the capabilities approach, a framework to measure the ability of different policies to improve human welfare equity. Furthermore, we lay out how AI research has the potential to catalyze social progress by expanding and equalizing capabilities. We show how the capabilities approach aligns with a participatory approach for the design and implementation of AI for social good research in a framework we introduce called PACT, in which community members affected should be brought in as partners and their input prioritized throughout the project. We conclude by providing an incomplete set of guiding questions for carrying out such participatory AI research in a way that elicits and respects a community's own definition of social good."

First-Order Logic theories that admit polynomial-time WFOMC w.r.t domain cardinality are called domain liftable. We introduce the concept of lifted interpretations as a tool for formulating closed-forms for WFOMC. Using lifted interpretations, we reconstruct the closed-form formula for polynomial-time FOMC in the universally quantified fragment of FO2, earlier proposed by Beame et al. We then expand this closed-form to incorporate cardinality constraints, existential quantifiers, and counting quantifiers (a.k.a C2) without losing domain-liftability. Finally, we show that the obtained closed-form motivates a natural definition of a family of weight functions strictly larger than symmetric weight functions."
923,aaai,2022,Selecting Optimal Context Sentences for Event-Event Relation Extraction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21354,"Relation extraction (RE) aims to extract potential relations according to the context of two entities, thus, deriving rational contexts from sentences plays an important role. Previous works either focus on how to leverage the entity information (e.g., entity types, entity verbalization) to inference relations, but ignore context-focused content, or use counterfactual thinking to remove the model's bias of potential relations in entities, but the relation reasoning process will still be hindered by irrelevant content. Therefore, how to preserve relevant content and remove noisy segments from sentences is a crucial task. In addition, retained content needs to be fluent enough to maintain semantic coherence and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel rationale extraction framework named RE2, which leverages two continuity and sparsity factors to obtain relevant and coherent rationales from sentences. To solve the problem that the gold rationales are not labeled, RE2 applies an optimizable binary mask to each token in the sentence, and adjust the rationales that need to be selected according to the relation label. Experiments on four datasets show that RE2 surpasses baselines."

Our model consists of an encoder network that incrementally builds the semantic parse tree by predicting the non-terminal label and its positions in the linearized tree. At the generation time, the model constructs the semantic parse tree by recursively inserting the predicted non-terminal labels at the predicted positions until termination. RINE achieves state-of-the-art exact match accuracy on low- and high-resource versions of the conversational semantic parsing benchmark TOP (Gupta et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020), outperforming strong sequence-to-sequence models and transition-based parsers. We also show that our model design is applicable to nested named entity recognition task, where it performs on par with state-of-the-art approach designed for that task. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is 2-3.5 times faster than the sequence-to-sequence model at inference time."

Current analyzers have been built to give feedback to experienced programmers who build new applications or systems. The type of feedback and the type of analysis of these tools focusses on mistakes that are relevant within that context, and help with debugging the system. When teaching novice programmers this type of advice is often not particularly useful. It would be instead more useful to use these techniques to find problem in the understanding of students of important programming concepts. This paper first explores in what respect static analyzers support the learning and teaching of programming can be implemented based on existing static analysis technology. It presents an extension to static analyzer PMD was made so that feedback messages appear which are easier to understand for novice programmers. To answer the question if these techniques are able to find conceptual mistakes that are characteristic for novice programmers make, we ran it over a number of student projects, and compared these results with publicly available mature software projects."

It is more challenging than traditional semantic segmentation tasks that segment known classes with abundant annotated images. In this paper, we propose a Prototype Refinement Network (PRNet) to attack the challenge of few-shot segmentation. It firstly learns to bidirectionally extract prototypes from both support and query images of the known classes. Furthermore, to extract representative prototypes of the new classes, we use adaptation and fusion for prototype refinement. The step of adaptation makes the model to learn new concepts which is directly implemented by retraining. Prototype fusion is firstly proposed which fuses support prototypes with query prototypes, incorporating the knowledge from both sides. It is effective in prototype refinement without importing extra learnable parameters. In this way, the prototypes become more discriminative in low-data regimes. Experiments on PASAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially on COCO-$20^i$, PRNet significantly outperforms existing methods by a large margin of 13.1\% in 1-shot setting."

This work combined elements of Eastern medicine and machine learning, and developed a preoperative assessment tool to predict the prognosis of lumbar spinal surgery in LBP and sciatica patients. Standard operative assessments, traditional Chinese medicine body constitution assessments, planned surgical approach, and vowel pronunciation recordings were collected and stored in different modalities. Our work provides insights into leveraging modality combinations, multimodals, and fusion strategies. The interpretability of models and correlations between modalities were also inspected. Based on the recruited 105 patients, we found that combining standard operative assessments, body constitution assessments, and planned surgical approach achieved the best performance in 0.81 accuracy. Our approach is effective and can be widely applied in general practice due to simplicity and effective."

Retraining from scratch with the particular user's data omitted fully removes its influence on the resulting model, but comes with a high computational cost. Machine ""unlearning"" mitigates the cost incurred by full retraining: instead, models are updated incrementally, possibly only requiring retraining when approximation errors accumulate. Rapid progress has been made towards privacy guarantees on the indistinguishability of unlearned and retrained models, but current formalisms do not place practical bounds on computation. In this paper we demonstrate how an attacker can exploit this oversight, highlighting a novel attack surface introduced by machine unlearning. We consider an attacker aiming to increase the computational cost of data removal. We derive and empirically investigate a poisoning attack on certified machine unlearning where strategically designed training data triggers complete retraining when removed."
929,aaai,2022,Exploring Safer Behaviors for Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20737,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have great successes in solving tasks with large observation and action spaces from limited feedback. Still, training the agents is data-intensive and there are no guarantees that the learned behavior is safe and does not violate rules of the environment, which has limitations for the practical deployment in real-world scenarios. This paper discusses the engineering of reliable agents via the integration of deep RL with constraint-based augmentation models to guide the RL agent towards safe behavior. Within the constraints set, the RL agent is free to adapt and explore, such that its effectiveness to solve the given problem is not hindered. However, once the RL agent leaves the space defined by the constraints, the outside models can provide guidance to still work reliably. We discuss integration points for constraint guidance within the RL process and perform experiments on two case studies: a strictly constrained card game and a grid world environment with additional combinatorial subgoals. Our results show that constraint-guidance does both provide reliability improvements and safer behavior, as well as accelerated training."

This framework is constructed specifically for a linear approximation of Bayesian filtering that uses the theory of Optimal Transport. As a part of this framework, we present three traditionally-used nonlinear equality constraint-preserving algorithms coupled with the Optimal Transport based filter: the equality-constrained Optimal Transport filter, the projected Optimal Transport filter, and the measurement-augmented Optimal Transport filter. In cases where the nonlinear equality-constraints represent an arbitrary convex manifold, we show that the re-sampling step of Optimal Transport filter, can generate initial samples for filtering, from any probability distribution function defined on this manifold. We show numerical results using our proposed framework."

Item Response Theory (IRT) is a classical cognitive diagnosis method which can provide interpretable parameters (i.e., student latent trait, question discrimination, and difficulty) for analyzing student performance. However, traditional IRT ignores the rich information in question texts, cannot diagnose knowledge concept proficiency, and it is inaccurate to diagnose the parameters for the questions which only appear several times. To this end, in this paper, we propose a general Deep Item Response Theory (DIRT) framework to enhance traditional IRT for cognitive diagnosis by exploiting semantic representation from question texts with deep learning. In DIRT, we first use a proficiency vector to represent students' proficiency in knowledge concepts and embed question texts and knowledge concepts to dense vectors by Word2Vec. Then, we design a deep diagnosis module to diagnose parameters in traditional IRT by deep learning techniques. Finally, with the diagnosed parameters, we input them into the logistic-like formula of IRT to predict student performance. Extensive experimental results on real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretation power of DIRT framework."

A different idea has been recently proposed, named Friendly Training, which consists in altering the input data by adding an automatically estimated perturbation, with the goal of facilitating the learning process of a neural classifier. The transformation progressively fades-out as long as training proceeds, until it completely vanishes. In this work we revisit and extend this idea, introducing a radically different and novel approach inspired by the effectiveness of neural generators in the context of Adversarial Machine Learning. We propose an auxiliary multi-layer network that is responsible of altering the input data to make them easier to be handled by the classifier at the current stage of the training procedure. The auxiliary network is trained jointly with the neural classifier, thus intrinsically increasing the 'depth' of the classifier, and it is expected to spot general regularities in the data alteration process. The effect of the auxiliary network is progressively reduced up to the end of training, when it is fully dropped and the classifier is deployed for applications. We refer to this approach as Neural Friendly Training. An extended experimental procedure involving several datasets and different neural architectures shows that Neural Friendly Training overcomes the originally proposed Friendly Training technique, improving the generalization of the classifier, especially in the case of noisy data."
933,aaai,2022,An Experimental Design Approach for Regret Minimization in Logistic Bandits,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20741,"In this work we consider the problem of regret minimization for logistic bandits. The main challenge of logistic bandits is reducing the dependence on a potentially large problem dependent constant $\kappa$ that can at worst scale exponentially with the norm of the unknown parameter $\theta_{\ast}$. Abeille et al. (2021) have applied self-concordance of the logistic function to remove this worst-case dependence providing regret guarantees like $O(d\log^2(\kappa)\sqrt{\dot\mu T}\log(|\mathcal{X}|))$ where $d$ is the dimensionality, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\dot\mu$ is the variance of the best-arm. This work improves upon this bound in the fixed arm setting by employing an experimental design procedure that achieves a minimax regret of $O(\sqrt{d \dot\mu T\log(|\mathcal{X}|)})$. Our regret bound in fact takes a tighter instance (i.e., gap) dependent regret bound for the first time in logistic bandits. We also propose a new warmup sampling algorithm that can dramatically reduce the lower order term in the regret in general and prove that it can replace the lower order term dependency on $\kappa$ to $\log^2(\kappa)$ for some instances. Finally, we discuss the impact of the bias of the MLE on the logistic bandit problem, providing an example where $d^2$ lower order regret (cf., it is $d$ for linear bandits) may not be improved as long as the MLE is used and how bias-corrected estimators may be used to make it closer to $d$."

The algorithm rotates successively two columns of the recurrent matrix, an operation that can be efficiently implemented as a multiplication by a Givens matrix. In the case when the coordinate is selected uniformly at random at each iteration, we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm under standard assumptions on the loss function, stepsize and minibatch noise. In addition, we numerically demonstrate that the Riemannian gradient in recurrent neural network training has an approximately sparse structure. Leveraging this observation, we propose a faster variant of the proposed algorithm that relies on the Gauss-Southwell rule. Experiments on a benchmark recurrent neural network training problem are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

This paper describes our work to assist non-profits that employ automated messaging programs to deliver timely preventive care information to beneficiaries (new and expecting mothers) during pregnancy and after delivery. Unfortunately, a key challenge in such information delivery programs is that a significant fraction of beneficiaries drop out of the program. Yet, non-profits often have limited health-worker resources (time) to place crucial service calls for live interaction with beneficiaries to prevent such engagement drops. To assist non-profits in optimizing this limited resource, we developed a Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) system. One key technical contribution in this system is a novel clustering method of offline historical data to infer unknown RMAB parameters. Our second major contribution is evaluation of our RMAB system in collaboration with an NGO, via a real-world service quality improvement study. The study compared strategies for optimizing service calls to 23003 participants over a period of 7 weeks to reduce engagement drops. We show that the RMAB group provides statistically significant improvement over other comparison groups, reducing ~ 30% engagement drops. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the utility of RMABs in real world public health settings. We are transitioning our RMAB system to the NGO for real-world use."

This work paves the way for scalable Neural ODEs with time-to-prediction comparable to traditional discrete networks. We introduce hypersolvers, neural networks designed to solve ODEs with low overhead and theoretical guarantees on accuracy. The synergistic combination of hypersolvers and Neural ODEs allows for cheap inference and unlocks a new frontier for practical application of continuous-depth models. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks, such as sampling for continuous normalizing flows, reveal consistent pareto efficiency over classical numerical methods."

In this article, we propose an approach for identifying gender and racial stereotypes in word embeddings trained on judicial opinions from U.S. case law. Embeddings containing stereotype information may cause harm when used by downstream systems for classification, information extraction, question answering, or other machine learning systems used to build legal research tools. We first explain how previously proposed methods for identifying these biases are not well suited for use with word embeddings trained on legal opinion text. We then propose a domain adapted method for identifying gender and racial biases in the legal domain. Our analyses using these methods suggest that racial and gender biases are encoded into word embeddings trained on legal opinions. These biases are not mitigated by exclusion of historical data, and appear across multiple large topical areas of the law. Implications for downstream systems that use legal opinion word embeddings and suggestions for potential mitigation strategies based on our observations are also discussed."

At the core of this challenge is how to access contextually relevant knowledge on demand and reason over it.   In this paper, we present initial studies toward zero-shot commonsense question answering by formulating the task as inference over dynamically generated commonsense knowledge graphs. In contrast to previous studies for knowledge integration that rely on retrieval of existing knowledge from static knowledge graphs, our study requires commonsense knowledge integration where contextually relevant knowledge is often not present in existing knowledge bases. Therefore, we present a novel approach that generates contextually-relevant symbolic knowledge structures on demand using generative neural commonsense knowledge models.   Empirical results on two datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our neuro-symbolic approach for dynamically constructing knowledge graphs for reasoning. Our approach achieves significant performance boosts over pretrained language models and vanilla knowledge models, all while providing interpretable reasoning paths for its predictions."

With the aid of artificial curiosity, we could equip current techniques for control, such as Reinforcement Learning, with more natural exploration capabilities. A promising approach in this respect has consisted of using Bayesian surprise on model parameters, i.e. a metric for the difference between prior and posterior beliefs, to favour exploration. In this contribution, we propose to apply Bayesian surprise in a latent space representing the agent's current understanding of the dynamics of the system, drastically reducing the computational costs. We extensively evaluate our method by measuring the agent's performance in terms of environment exploration, for continuous tasks, and looking at the game scores achieved, for video games. Our model is computationally cheap and compares positively with current state-of-the-art methods on several problems. We also investigate the effects caused by stochasticity in the environment, which is often a failure case for curiosity-driven agents.

More recently they have also started to report on their environmental impact and their social responsibility. The latest trend is now to deliver one single integrated report where all stakeholders of the company can easily connect all facets of the business with their impact considered in a broad sense. The main purpose of this integrated approach is to avoid delivering data related to disconnected silos, which consequently makes it very difficult to globally assess the overall performance of an entity or a business line. In this paper, we focus on how companies report on risks and ethical issues related to the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We explain some of these risks and potential issues. Next, we identify some recent initiatives by various stakeholders to define a global ethical framework for AI. Finally, we illustrate with four cases that companies are very shy to report on these facets of AI."

Sparse decision tree optimization is computationally hard, and despite steady effort since the 1960's, breakthroughs have only been made on the problem within the past few years, primarily on the problem of finding optimal sparse decision trees. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms often require impractical amounts of computation time and memory to find optimal or near-optimal trees for some real-world datasets, particularly those having several continuous-valued features. Given that the search spaces of these decision tree optimization problems are massive, can we practically hope to find a sparse decision tree that competes in accuracy with a black box machine learning model? We address this problem via smart guessing strategies that can be applied to any optimal branch-and-bound-based decision tree algorithm. We show that by using these guesses, we can reduce the run time by multiple orders of magnitude, while providing bounds on how far the resulting trees can deviate from the black box's accuracy and expressive power. Our approach enables guesses about how to bin continuous features, the size of the tree, and lower bounds on the error for the optimal decision tree. Our experiments show that in many cases we can rapidly construct sparse decision trees that match the accuracy of black box models. To summarize: when you are having trouble optimizing, just guess."

Learning Sketches for Programmatic Strategies,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20744,"In this paper we show that behavioral cloning can be used to learn effective sketches of programmatic strategies. We show that even the sketches learned by cloning the behavior of weak players can help the synthesis of programmatic strategies. This is because even weak players can provide helpful information, e.g., that a player must choose an action in their turn of the game. If behavioral cloning is not employed, the synthesizer needs to learn even the most basic information by playing the game, which can be computationally expensive. We demonstrate empirically the advantages of our sketch-learning approach with simulated annealing and UCT synthesizers. We evaluate our synthesizers in the games of Can't Stop and MicroRTS. The sketch-based synthesizers are able to learn stronger programmatic strategies than their original counterparts. Our synthesizers generate strategies of Can't Stop that defeat a traditional programmatic strategy for the game. They also synthesize strategies that defeat the best performing method from the latest MicroRTS competition."

While methods that use style-based GANs can generate strikingly photorealistic face images, it is often difficult to control the characteristics of the generated faces in a meaningful and disentangled way. Prior approaches aim to achieve such semantic control and disentanglement within the latent space of a previously trained GAN. In contrast, we propose a framework that a priori models physical attributes of the face such as 3D shape, albedo, pose, and lighting explicitly, thus providing disentanglement by design. Our method, MOST-GAN, integrates the expressive power and photorealism of style-based GANs with the physical disentanglement and flexibility of nonlinear 3D morphable models, which we couple with a state-of-the-art 2D hair manipulation network. MOST-GAN achieves photorealistic manipulation of portrait images with fully disentangled 3D control over their physical attributes, enabling extreme manipulation of lighting, facial expression, and pose variations up to full profile view."

We solve the stochastic shortest path problem for a large network by estimating the density of the edge weights in the network and analytically finding the distribution of a path. In this study, we employ Gaussian Processes to model the edge weights. This approach not only reduces the analytical complexity associated with computing the stochastic shortest path but also yields satisfactory performance. We also provide an online version of the model that yields a 30 times speedup in the algorithm's runtime while retaining equivalent performance. As an application of the model, we design a real-time trip planning system to find the stochastic shortest path between locations in the public transit network of Delhi. Our observations show that different paths have different likelihoods of being the shortest path at any given time in a public transit network. We demonstrate that choosing the stochastic shortest path over a deterministic shortest path leads to savings in travel time of up to 40\%. Thus, our model takes a significant step towards creating a reliable trip planner and increase the confidence of the general public in developing countries to take up public transit as a primary mode of transportation."

What is the nature of the trade-off between maximizing collective welfare and minimizing disparities between more and less privileged communities? To evaluate vaccination strategies, we propose a novel epidemic model that explicitly accounts for both demographic and mobility differences among communities and their association with heterogeneous COVID-19 risks, then calibrate it with large-scale data. Using this model, we find that social utility and equity can be simultaneously improved when vaccine access is prioritized for the most disadvantaged communities, which holds even when such communities manifest considerable vaccine reluctance. Nevertheless, equity among distinct demographic features are in tension due to their complex correlation in society. We design two behavior-and-demography-aware indices, community risk and societal harm, which capture the risks communities face and those they impose on society from not being vaccinated, to inform the design of comprehensive vaccine distribution strategies. Our study provides a framework for uniting utility and equity-based considerations in vaccine distribution, and sheds light on how to balance multiple ethical values in complex settings for epidemic control."

In most applications, however, the marginal likelihood is not analytically tractable and must be approximated using numerical methods. Here we provide a tutorial on bridge sampling (Bennett, 1976; Meng & Wong, 1996), a reliable and relatively straightforward sampling method that allows researchers to obtain the marginal likelihood for models of varying complexity. First, we introduce bridge sampling and three related sampling methods using the beta-binomial model as a running example. We then apply bridge sampling to estimate the marginal likelihood for the Expectancy Valence (EV) model---a popular model for reinforcement learning. Our results indicate that bridge sampling provides accurate estimates for both a single participant and a hierarchical version of the EV model. We conclude that bridge sampling is an attractive method for mathematical psychologists who typically aim to approximate the marginal likelihood for a limited set of possibly high-dimensional models."

Recently, deep clustering methods (algorithms based on deep learning) have attracted wide attention with their impressive performance. Most of these algorithms combine deep unsupervised representation learning and standard clustering together. However, the separation of representation learning and clustering will lead to suboptimal solutions because the two-stage strategy prevents representation learning from adapting to subsequent tasks (e.g., clustering according to specific cues). To overcome this issue, efforts have been made in the dynamic adaption of representation and cluster assignment, whereas current state-of-the-art methods suffer from heuristically constructed objectives with representation and cluster assignment alternatively optimized. To further standardize the clustering problem, we audaciously formulate the objective of clustering as finding a precise feature as the cue for cluster assignment. Based on this, we propose a general-purpose deep clustering framework which radically integrates representation learning and clustering into a single pipeline for the first time. The proposed framework exploits the powerful ability of recently developed generative models for learning intrinsic features, and imposes an entropy minimization on the distribution of the cluster assignment by a dedicated variational algorithm. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior, or at least comparable to, the state-of-the-art methods on the handwritten digit recognition, fashion recognition, face recognition and object recognition benchmark datasets."

Many numerical weather prediction models provide deterministic forecasts with limited measures of their forecast uncertainty. Standard postprocessing techniques may struggle with extreme events or use a 30-day training window that will not adequately characterize the uncertainty of a tropical cyclone forecast. We propose a novel approach that leverages information from past storm events, using a hierarchical model to quantify uncertainty in the spatial correlation parameters of the forecast errors (modeled as Gaussian processes) for a numerical weather prediction model. This approach addresses a massive data problem by implementing a drastic dimension reduction through the assumption that the MLE and Hessian matrix represent all useful information from each tropical cyclone. From this, simulated forecast errors provide uncertainty quantification for future tropical cyclone forecasts. We apply this method to the North American Mesoscale model forecasts and use observations based on the Stage IV data product for 47 tropical cyclones between 2004 and 2017. For an incoming storm, our hierarchical framework combines the forecast from the North American Mesoscale model with the information from previous storms to create 95\% and 99\% prediction maps of rain. For six test storms from 2018 and 2019, these maps provide appropriate probabilistic coverage of observations. We show evidence from the log scoring rule that the proposed hierarchical framework performs best among competing methods."

With cluttered traffic scenes and limited visual cues, it is of great challenge to predict how long there will be an accident from early observed frames. Most existing approaches are developed to learn features of accident-relevant agents for accident anticipation, while ignoring the features of their spatial and temporal relations. Besides, current deterministic deep neural networks could be overconfident in false predictions, leading to high risk of traffic accidents caused by self-driving systems. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based accident anticipation model with spatio-temporal relational learning. It sequentially predicts the probability of traffic accident occurrence with dashcam videos. Specifically, we propose to take advantage of graph convolution and recurrent networks for relational feature learning, and leverage Bayesian neural networks to address the intrinsic variability of latent relational representations. The derived uncertainty-based ranking loss is found to significantly boost model performance by improving the quality of relational features. In addition, we collect a new Car Crash Dataset (CCD) for traffic accident anticipation which contains environmental attributes and accident reasons annotations. Experimental results on both public and the newly-compiled datasets show state-of-the-art performance of our model. Our code and CCD dataset are available at https://github.com/Cogito2012/UString."

However, performing object detection over large geographies can still be prohibitively expensive due to the high cost of purchasing imagery and compute. Inspired by traditional survey data collection strategies, we propose an approach to estimate object count statistics over large geographies through sampling. Given a cost budget, our method selects a small number of representative areas by sampling from a learnable proposal distribution. Using importance sampling, we are able to accurately estimate object counts after processing only a small fraction of the images compared to an exhaustive approach. We show empirically that the proposed framework achieves strong performance on estimating the number of buildings in the United States and Africa, cars in Kenya, brick kilns in Bangladesh, and swimming pools in the U.S., while requiring as few as 0.01% of satellite images compared to an exhaustive approach."

Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) is an extension of this task to temporal knowledge graphs, where each fact is additionally associated with a time stamp. Current approaches for TKGC primarily build on existing embedding models which are developed for (static) knowledge graph completion, and extend these models to incorporate time, where the idea is to learn latent representations for entities, relations, and timestamps and then use the learned representations to predict missing facts at various time steps. In this paper, we propose BoxTE, a box embedding model for TKGC, building on the static knowledge graph embedding model BoxE. We show that BoxTE is fully expressive, and possesses strong inductive capacity in the temporal setting. We then empirically evaluate our model and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on several TKGC benchmarks."

This paper proposes a spatial uncertainty-aware semi-supervised approach via regularized surrogate task (binary segmentation) for crowd counting problems. Different from existing semi-supervised learning-based crowd counting methods, to exploit the unlabeled data, our proposed spatial uncertainty-aware teacher-student framework focuses on high confident regions' information while addressing the noisy supervision from the unlabeled data in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we estimate the spatial uncertainty maps from the teacher model's surrogate task to guide the feature learning of the main task (density regression) and the surrogate task of the student model at the same time. Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective differential transformation layer to enforce the inherent spatial consistency regularization between the main task and the surrogate task in the student model, which helps the surrogate task to yield more reliable predictions and generates high-quality uncertainty maps. Thus, our model can also address the task-level perturbation problems that occur spatial inconsistency between the primary and surrogate tasks in the student model. Experimental results on four challenging crowd counting datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods."

Lomonaco and Kauffman introduced the knot mosaic system to give a definition of the quantum knot system that is intended to represent an actual physical quantum system. Recently the authors developed an algorithm producing the exact enumeration of knot mosaics, which uses a recursion formula of state matrices. As a sequel to this research program, we similarly define the (embedded) graph mosaic system by using sixteen graph mosaic tiles, representing graph diagrams with vertices of valence 3 and 4. And we extend the algorithm to produce the exact number of all graph mosaics. The magnified state matrix that is an extension of the state matrix is mainly used."

While much research attention has been placed on designing new out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods, the precise definition of OOD is often left in vagueness and falls short of the desired notion of OOD in reality. In this paper, we present a new formalization and model the data shifts by taking into account both the invariant and environmental (spurious) features. Under such formalization, we systematically investigate how spurious correlation in the training set impacts OOD detection. Our results suggest that the detection performance is severely worsened when the correlation between spurious features and labels is increased in the training set. We further show insights on detection methods that are more effective in reducing the impact of spurious correlation and provide theoretical analysis on why reliance on environmental features leads to high OOD detection error. Our work aims to facilitate a better understanding of OOD samples and their formalization, as well as the exploration of methods that enhance OOD detection."

NTP takes as input a task specification (e.g., video demonstration of a task) and recursively decomposes it into finer sub-task specifications. These specifications are fed to a hierarchical neural program, where bottom-level programs are callable subroutines that interact with the environment. We validate our method in three robot manipulation tasks. NTP achieves strong generalization across sequential tasks that exhibit hierarchal and compositional structures. The experimental results show that NTP learns to generalize well to- wards unseen tasks with increasing lengths, variable topologies, and changing objectives."

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a crucial part of that system. It is about inferring the skill mastery of students and predicting their performance to adjust the curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning-based KT models have shown significant predictive performance compared with traditional models. However, it is difficult to extract psychologically meaningful explanations from the tens of thousands of parameters in neural networks, that would relate to cognitive theory. There are several ways to achieve high accuracy in student performance prediction but diagnostic and prognostic reasoning is more critical in learning sciences. Since KT problem has few observable features (problem ID and student's correctness at each practice), we extract meaningful latent features from students' response data by using machine learning and data mining techniques. In this work, we present Interpretable Knowledge Tracing (IKT), a simple model that relies on three meaningful latent features: individual skill mastery, ability profile (learning transfer across skills), and problem difficulty. IKT's prediction of future student performance is made using a Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier (TAN), therefore its predictions are easier to explain than deep learning-based student models. IKT also shows better student performance prediction than deep learning-based student models without requiring a huge amount of parameters. We conduct ablation studies on each feature to examine their contribution to student performance prediction. Thus, IKT has great potential for providing adaptive and personalized instructions with causal reasoning in real-world educational systems."
962,aaai,2022,An Evaluative Measure of Clustering Methods Incorporating Hyperparameter Sensitivity,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20747,"Embedding knowledge graphs into low-dimensional spaces is a popular method for applying approaches, such as link prediction or node classification, to these databases. This embedding process is very costly in terms of both computational time and space. Part of the reason for this is the optimisation of hyperparameters, which involves repeatedly sampling, by random, guided, or brute-force selection, from a large hyperparameter space and testing the resulting embeddings for their quality. However, not all hyperparameters in this search space will be equally important. In fact, with prior knowledge of the relative importance of the hyperparameters, some could be eliminated from the search altogether without significantly impacting the overall quality of the outputted embeddings. To this end, we ran a Sobol sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effects of tuning different hyperparameters on the variance of embedding quality. This was achieved by performing thousands of embedding trials, each time measuring the quality of embeddings produced by different hyperparameter configurations. We regressed the embedding quality on those hyperparameter configurations, using this model to generate Sobol sensitivity indices for each of the hyperparameters. By evaluating the correlation between Sobol indices, we find substantial variability in the hyperparameter sensitivities between knowledge graphs, with differing dataset characteristics being the probable cause of these inconsistencies. As an additional contribution of this work we identify several relations in the UMLS knowledge graph that may cause data leakage via inverse relations, and derive and present UMLS-43, a leakage-robust variant of that graph."

Use of deformation transfer or multilinear tensor as a personalized 3DMM for blendshape interpolation does not address the fact that facial expressions result in different local and global skin deformations in different persons. Moreover, existing methods learn a single albedo per user which is not enough to capture the expression-specific skin reflectance variations. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly learns a personalized face model per user and per-frame facial motion parameters from a large corpus of in-the-wild videos of user expressions. Specifically, we learn user-specific expression blendshapes and dynamic (expression-specific) albedo maps by predicting personalized corrections on top of a 3DMM prior. We introduce novel constraints to ensure that the corrected blendshapes retain their semantic meanings and the reconstructed geometry is disentangled from the albedo. Experimental results show that our personalization accurately captures fine-grained facial dynamics in a wide range of conditions and efficiently decouples the learned face model from facial motion, resulting in more accurate face reconstruction and facial motion retargeting compared to state-of-the-art methods."

Graph-level representations are critical in a variety of real-world applications such as predicting the properties of molecules and community analysis in social networks. Traditional graph kernel based methods are simple, yet effective for obtaining fixed-length representations for graphs but they suffer from poor generalization due to hand-crafted designs. There are also some recent methods based on language models (e.g. graph2vec) but they tend to only consider certain substructures (e.g. subtrees) as graph representatives. Inspired by recent progress of unsupervised representation learning, in this paper we proposed a novel method called InfoGraph for learning graph-level representations. We maximize the mutual information between the graph-level representation and the representations of substructures of different scales (e.g., nodes, edges, triangles). By doing so, the graph-level representations encode aspects of the data that are shared across different scales of substructures. Furthermore, we further propose InfoGraph*, an extension of InfoGraph for semi-supervised scenarios. InfoGraph* maximizes the mutual information between unsupervised graph representations learned by InfoGraph and the representations learned by existing supervised methods. As a result, the supervised encoder learns from unlabeled data while preserving the latent semantic space favored by the current supervised task. Experimental results on the tasks of graph classification and molecular property prediction show that InfoGraph is superior to state-of-the-art baselines and InfoGraph* can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art semi-supervised models."

To this end, we i) show that standard composition tools outperform more advanced techniques in many settings, ii) empirically and theoretically demonstrate an intrinsic connection between the learning rate and clipping norm hyperparameters, iii) show that adaptive optimizers like DPAdam enjoy a significant advantage in the process of honest hyperparameter tuning, and iv) draw upon novel limiting behaviour of Adam in the DP setting to design a new and more efficient optimizer."

It is well known that learning the structure of a general BN is both computationally and statistically challenging. However, often in many applications, side information about the underlying structure can potentially reduce the learning complexity. In this paper, we develop a recursive constraint-based algorithm that efficiently incorporates such knowledge (i.e., side information) into the learning process. In particular, we study two types of structural side information about the underlying BN: (I) an upper bound on its clique number is known, or (II) it is diamond-free. We provide theoretical guarantees for the learning algorithms, including the worst-case number of tests required in each scenario. As a consequence of our work, we show that bounded treewidth BNs can be learned with polynomial complexity.

However, the vulnerability of neural networks against adversarial attacks poses a serious threat to the people affected by these systems. In this paper, we focus on a real-world threat model where a Man-in-the-Middle adversary maliciously intercepts and perturbs images web users upload online. This type of attack can raise severe ethical concerns on top of simple performance degradation. To prevent this attack, we devise a novel bi-level optimization algorithm that finds points in the vicinity of natural images that are robust to adversarial perturbations. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show our method can effectively robustify natural images within the given modification budget. We also show the proposed method can improve robustness when jointly used with randomized smoothing."

Often, transparency of a given system is achieved by providing explanations of the behavior and predictions of the given system. Counterfactual explanations are a prominent instance of particular intuitive explanations of decision making systems. While a lot of different methods for computing counterfactual explanations exist, only very few work (apart from work from the causality domain) considers feature dependencies as well as plausibility which might limit the set of possible counterfactual explanations.   In this work we enhance our previous work on convex modeling for computing counterfactual explanations by a mechanism for ensuring actionability and plausibility of the resulting counterfactual explanations."

In this paper, we present BASS, a novel framework for Boosting Abstractive Summarization based on a unified Semantic graph, which aggregates co-referent phrases distributing across a long range of context and conveys rich relations between phrases. Further, a graph-based encoder-decoder model is proposed to improve both the document representation and summary generation process by leveraging the graph structure. Specifically, several graph augmentation methods are designed to encode both the explicit and implicit relations in the text while the graph-propagation attention mechanism is developed in the decoder to select salient content into the summary. Empirical results show that the proposed architecture brings substantial improvements for both long-document and multi-document summarization tasks."

While a plethora of algorithmic approaches have recently emerged for OOD detection, a critical gap remains in theoretical understanding. In this work, we develop an analytical framework that characterizes and unifies the theoretical understanding for OOD detection. Our analytical framework motivates a novel OOD detection method for neural networks, GEM, which demonstrates both theoretical and empirical superiority. In particular, on CIFAR-100 as in-distribution data, our method outperforms a competitive baseline by 16.57% (FPR95). Lastly, we formally provide provable guarantees and comprehensive analysis of our method, underpinning how various properties of data distribution affect the performance of OOD detection."

For this collaboration to perform properly, the human decision maker must have a mental model of when and when not to rely on the agent. In this work, we aim to ensure that human decision makers learn a valid mental model of the agent's strengths and weaknesses. To accomplish this goal, we propose an exemplar-based teaching strategy where humans solve the task with the help of the agent and try to formulate a set of guidelines of when and when not to defer. We present a novel parameterization of the human's mental model of the AI that applies a nearest neighbor rule in local regions surrounding the teaching examples. Using this model, we derive a near-optimal strategy for selecting a representative teaching set. We validate the benefits of our teaching strategy on a multi-hop question answering task using crowd workers and find that when workers draw the right lessons from the teaching stage, their task performance improves, we furthermore validate our method on a set of synthetic experiments."

To address this, we introduce a practical algorithm for incorporating human insight to speed learning. Our algorithm, Constraint Sampling Reinforcement Learning (CSRL), incorporates prior domain knowledge as constraints/restrictions on the RL policy. It takes in multiple potential policy constraints to maintain robustness to misspecification of individual constraints while leveraging helpful ones to learn quickly. Given a base RL learning algorithm (ex. UCRL, DQN, Rainbow) we propose an upper confidence with elimination scheme that leverages the relationship between the constraints, and their observed performance, to adaptively switch among them. We instantiate our algorithm with DQN-type algorithms and UCRL as base algorithms, and evaluate our algorithm in four environments, including three simulators based on real data: recommendations, educational activity sequencing, and HIV treatment sequencing. In all cases, CSRL learns a good policy faster than baselines."

The crux of the problem for a reinforcement learning agent in such TBGs is identifying the objects in the world, and those objects' relations with that world. While the recent use of text-based resources for increasing an agent's knowledge and improving its generalization have shown promise, we posit in this paper that there is much yet to be learned from visual representations of these same worlds. Specifically, we propose to retrieve images that represent specific instances of text observations from the world and train our agents on such images. This improves the agent's overall understanding of the game 'scene' and objects' relationships to the world around them, and the variety of visual representations on offer allow the agent to generate a better generalization of a relationship. We show that incorporating such images improves the performance of agents in various TBG settings."

Along this line, we address the problem of unsupervised reinforcement learning in a class of multiple environments, in which the policy is pre-trained with interactions from the whole class, and then fine-tuned for several tasks in any environment of the class. Notably, the problem is inherently multi-objective as we can trade off the pre-training objective between environments in many ways. In this work, we foster an exploration strategy that is sensitive to the most adverse cases within the class. Hence, we cast the exploration problem as the maximization of the mean of a critical percentile of the state visitation entropy induced by the exploration strategy over the class of environments. Then, we present a policy gradient algorithm, $\alpha$MEPOL, to optimize the introduced objective through mediated interactions with the class. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the ability of the algorithm in learning to explore challenging classes of continuous environments and we show that reinforcement learning greatly benefits from the pre-trained exploration strategy w.r.t. learning from scratch."

Most of the advertisers typically prefer to impose the delivery constraint to spend budget smoothly over the time in order to reach a wider range of audiences and have a sustainable impact. Since lots of impressions are traded through public auctions for online advertising today, the liquidity makes price elasticity and bid landscape between demand and supply change quite dynamically. Therefore, it is challenging to perform smooth pacing control and maximize campaign performance simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a smart pacing approach in which the delivery pace of each campaign is learned from both offline and online data to achieve smooth delivery and optimal performance goals. The implementation of the proposed approach in a real DSP system is also presented. Experimental evaluations on both real online ad campaigns and offline simulations show that our approach can effectively improve campaign performance and achieve delivery goals."

Research has focused mostly on the following two cases: when no information regarding the ordering of the nodes in the DAG is available, and when a domain-specific complete ordering of the nodes is available. In this paper, motivated by a recent application in dairy science, we develop a method for DAG estimation for the middle scenario, where partition based partial ordering of the nodes is known based on domain specific knowledge.We develop an efficient algorithm that solves the posited problem, coined Partition-DAG. Through extensive simulations using the DREAM3 Yeast data, we illustrate that Partition-DAG effectively incorporates the partial ordering information to improve both speed and accuracy. We then illustrate the usefulness of Partition-DAG by applying it to recently collected dairy cattle data, and inferring relationships between various variables involved in dairy agroecosystems."

It is a mixed between science and philosophy of science, therefore we can talk about Experimental Philosophy of Science. As a first result, we introduce a new forecasting method based on image completion, named Forecasting Method by Image Inpainting (FM2I). In fact, time series forecasting is transformed into fully images- and signal-based processing procedures. After transforming a time series data into its corresponding image, the problem of data forecasting becomes essentially a problem of image inpainting problem, i.e., completing missing data in the image. An extensive experimental evaluation is conducted using a large dataset proposed by the well-known M3-competition. Results show that FM2I represents an efficient and robust tool for time series forecasting. It has achieved prominent results in terms of accuracy and outperforms the best M3 forecasting methods."

In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end deep learning framework to seamlessly map the tissue properties directly from spiral k-space MRF data, thereby avoiding time-consuming processing such as the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) and the dictionary-based Fingerprint matching. Our method directly consumes the non-Cartesian k- space data, performs adaptive density compensation, and predicts multiple tissue property maps in one forward pass. Experiments on both 2D and 3D MRF data demonstrate that quantification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods can be accomplished within 0.5 second, which is 1100 to 7700 times faster than the original MRF framework. The proposed method is thus promising for facilitating the adoption of MRF in clinical settings."

Word games are not as constrained as games like chess or poker. Instead, word game strategy is defined by the players' understanding of the way words relate to each other. The word game Codenames provides a unique opportunity to investigate common sense understanding of relationships between words, an important open challenge. We propose an algorithm that can generate Codenames clues from the language graph BabelNet or from any of several embedding methods - word2vec, GloVe, fastText or BERT. We introduce a new scoring function that measures the quality of clues, and we propose a weighting term called DETECT that incorporates dictionary-based word representations and document frequency to improve clue selection. We develop BabelNet-Word Selection Framework (BabelNet-WSF) to improve BabelNet clue quality and overcome the computational barriers that previously prevented leveraging language graphs for Codenames. Extensive experiments with human evaluators demonstrate that our proposed innovations yield state-of-the-art performance, with up to 102.8% improvement in precision@2 in some cases. Overall, this work advances the formal study of word games and approaches for common sense language understanding."
984,aaai,2022,Differential Assessment of Black-Box AI Agents,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i9.21223,"Much of the research on learning symbolic models of AI agents focuses on agents with stationary models. This assumption fails to hold in settings where the agent's capabilities may change as a result of learning, adaptation, or other post-deployment modifications. Efficient assessment of agents in such settings is critical for learning the true capabilities of an AI system and for ensuring its safe usage. In this work, we propose a novel approach to ""differentially"" assess black-box AI agents that have drifted from their previously known models. As a starting point, we consider the fully observable and deterministic setting. We leverage sparse observations of the drifted agent's current behavior and knowledge of its initial model to generate an active querying policy that selectively queries the agent and computes an updated model of its functionality. Empirical evaluation shows that our approach is much more efficient than re-learning the agent model from scratch. We also show that the cost of differential assessment using our method is proportional to the amount of drift in the agent's functionality."

It is a risk management framework that helps organizations to assign and coordinate risk management roles and responsibilities. In this article, I suggest ways in which AI companies could implement the model. I also discuss how the model could help reduce risks from AI: it could identify and close gaps in risk coverage, increase the effectiveness of risk management practices, and enable the board of directors to oversee management more effectively.

However, this paradigm suffers from the cold-start problem which will seriously compromise the ecological health of recommendation systems. This paper attempts to tackle the item cold-start problem by generating enhanced warmed-up ID embeddings for cold items with historical data and limited interaction records. From the aspect of industrial practice, we mainly focus on the following three points of item cold-start: 1) How to conduct cold-start without additional data requirements and make strategy easy to be deployed in online recommendation scenarios. 2) How to leverage both historical records and constantly emerging interaction data of new items. 3) How to model the relationship between item ID and side information stably from interaction data. To address these problems, we propose a model-agnostic Conditional Variational Autoencoder based Recommendation(CVAR) framework with some advantages including compatibility on various backbones, no extra requirements for data, utilization of both historical data and recent emerging interactions. CVAR uses latent variables to learn a distribution over item side information and generates desirable item ID embeddings using a conditional decoder. The proposed method is evaluated by extensive offline experiments on public datasets and online A/B tests on Tencent News recommendation platform, which further illustrate the advantages and robustness of CVAR."

The standard approach -- using a proper scoring rule to separately reward each expert -- is not robust to collusion: experts may collude to misreport their beliefs in a way that guarantees them a larger total reward no matter the eventual outcome. Chun and Shachter (2011) termed any such collusion ""arbitrage"" and asked whether there is any truthful elicitation mechanism that makes arbitrage impossible. We resolve this question positively, exhibiting a class of strictly proper arbitrage-free contract functions. These contract functions have two parts: one ensures that the total reward of a coalition of experts depends only on the average of their reports; the other ensures that changing this average report hurts the experts under at least one outcome."
989,aaai,2022,Improving Neural Cross-Lingual Abstractive Summarization via Employing Optimal Transport Distance for Knowledge Distillation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.21359,"Current state-of-the-art cross-lingual summarization models employ multi-task learning paradigm, which works on a shared vocabulary module and relies on the self-attention mechanism to attend among tokens in two languages. However, correlation learned by self-attention is often loose and implicit, inefficient in capturing crucial cross-lingual representations between languages. The matter worsens when performing on languages with separate morphological or structural features, making the cross-lingual alignment more challenging, resulting in the performance drop. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel Knowledge-Distillation-based framework for Cross-Lingual Summarization, seeking to explicitly construct cross-lingual correlation by distilling the knowledge of the monolingual summarization teacher into the cross-lingual summarization student. Since the representations of the teacher and the student lie on two different vector spaces, we further propose a Knowledge Distillation loss using Sinkhorn Divergence, an Optimal-Transport distance, to estimate the discrepancy between those teacher and student representations. Due to the intuitively geometric nature of Sinkhorn Divergence, the student model can productively learn to align its produced cross-lingual hidden states with monolingual hidden states, hence leading to a strong correlation between distant languages. Experiments on cross-lingual summarization datasets in pairs of distant languages demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models under both high and low-resourced settings."

This paper studies a class of probabilistic planning problems with intention deception and investigates how a defender's limited sensing modality can be exploited by an attacker to achieve its attack objective almost surely (with probability one) while hiding its intention. In particular, we model the attack planning in a stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The attacker is to reach some target states while avoiding unsafe states in the system and knows that his behavior is monitored by a defender with partial observations. Given partial state observations for the defender, we develop qualitative intention deception planning algorithms that construct attack strategies to play against an action-visible defender and an action-invisible defender, respectively. The synthesized attack strategy not only ensures the attack objective is satisfied almost surely but also deceives the defender into believing that the observed behavior is generated by a normal/legitimate user and thus failing to detect the presence of an attack. We show the proposed algorithms are correct and complete and illustrate the deceptive planning methods with examples."

Despite these benefits, some common concerns and criticisms are associated with learnersourcing (e.g., the quality of resources created by students, challenges in incentivising engagement and lack of availability of reliable learnersourcing systems), which have limited its adoption. This paper presents a framework that considers the existing learnersourcing literature, the latest insights from the learning sciences and advances in AI to offer promising future directions for developing learnersourcing systems. The framework is designed around important questions and human-AI partnerships relating to four key aspects: (1) creating novel content, (2) evaluating the quality of the created content, (3) utilising learnersourced contributions of students and (4) enabling instructors to support students in the learnersourcing process. We then present two comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of the proposed framework in relation to two existing popular learnersourcing systems."

Existing personalized conversation tasks typically require models to extract speaker preferences from user descriptions or their conversation histories, which are scarce for newcomers and inactive users. In this paper, we propose a few-shot personalized conversation task with an auxiliary social network. The task requires models to generate personalized responses for a speaker given a few conversations from the speaker and a social network. Existing methods are mainly designed to incorporate descriptions or conversation histories. Those methods can hardly model speakers with so few conversations or connections between speakers. To better cater for newcomers with few resources, we propose a personalized conversation model (PCM) that learns to adapt to new speakers as well as enabling new speakers to learn from resource-rich speakers. Particularly, based on a meta-learning based PCM, we propose a task aggregator (TA) to collect other speakers' information from the social network. The TA provides prior knowledge of the new speaker in its meta-learning. Experimental results show our methods outperform all baselines in appropriateness, diversity, and consistency with speakers."

In contrast to other differentiable physics approaches that use explicit forward models to define state transitions, we focus on implicit state transitions defined via function minimization. Implicit state transitions appear in implicit numerical integration methods, which offer the benefits of large time steps and excellent numerical stability, but require a special treatment to achieve differentiability due to the absence of an explicit differentiable forward pass. In contrast to other implicit differentiation approaches that require explicit formulas for the force function and the force Jacobian matrix, we present an energy-based approach that allows us to compute these derivatives automatically and in a matrix-free fashion via reverse-mode automatic differentiation. This allows for more flexibility and productivity when defining physical models and is particularly important in the context of neural network training, which often relies on reverse-mode automatic differentiation (backpropagation). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our differentiable simulator in policy optimization for locomotion tasks and show that it achieves better sample efficiency than model-free reinforcement learning."

While extensive efforts have been made to detect and remove backdoors from backdoored DNNs, it is still not clear whether a backdoor-free clean model can be directly obtained from poisoned datasets. In this paper, we first construct a causal graph to model the generation process of poisoned data and find that the backdoor attack acts as the confounder, which brings spurious associations between the input images and target labels, making the model predictions less reliable. Inspired by the causal understanding, we propose the Causality-inspired Backdoor Defense (CBD), to learn deconfounded representations for reliable classification. Specifically, a backdoored model is intentionally trained to capture the confounding effects. The other clean model dedicates to capturing the desired causal effects by minimizing the mutual information with the confounding representations from the backdoored model and employing a sample-wise re-weighting scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets against 6 state-of-the-art attacks verify that our proposed defense method is effective in reducing backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in predicting benign samples. Further analysis shows that CBD can also resist potential adaptive attacks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/zaixizhang/CBD}."

However, conventional decentralized federated algorithm sharing whole parameters of networks among clients suffers from privacy leakage in face recognition scene. In this work, we introduce a framework, FedGC, to tackle federated learning for face recognition and guarantees higher privacy. We explore a novel idea of correcting gradients from the perspective of backward propagation and propose a softmax-based regularizer to correct gradients of class embeddings by precisely injecting a cross-client gradient term. Theoretically, we show that FedGC constitutes a valid loss function similar to standard softmax. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of FedGC which can match the performance of conventional centralized methods utilizing full training dataset on several popular benchmark datasets."

We lay out a mathematical framework to formalize the optimization process. The method and implementation of the optimization is explained, and the results are then analyzed. We extend our model to control for asset allocation and show how the purchase policy changes when one is allowed to vary asset allocation. Our results indicate that (i.) refundable DIAs are less appealing than non-refundable DIAs because of the loss of mortality credits; (ii.) the DIA allocation region is larger under the fixed asset allocation strategy due to it becoming a proxy for fixed-income allocation; and (iii.) when the investor is allowed to change asset-allocation, DIA allocation becomes less appealing. However, a case for higher DIA allocation can be made for those individuals who perceive their longevity to be higher than the population."

In this paper, we propose GRAPHENE, which is a deep learning based framework for precise BLR. GRAPHENE consists of three main different modules 1) graph-augmented document representation learning; 2) query expansion and representation learning and 3) learning to rank biomedical articles. The graph-augmented document representation learning module constructs a document-concept graph containing biomedical concept nodes and document nodes so that global biomedical related concept from external knowledge source can be captured, which is further connected to a BiLSTM so both local and global topics can be explored. Query expansion and representation learning module expands the query with abbreviations and different names, and then builds a CNN-based model to convolve the expanded query and obtain a vector representation for each query. Learning to rank minimizes a ranking loss between biomedical articles with the query to learn the retrieval function.

1000,aaai,2022,Improving Evidential Deep Learning via Multi-Task Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20759,"Evidential deep learning, built upon belief theory and subjective logic, offers a principled and computationally efficient way to turn a deterministic neural network uncertainty-aware. The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions. A deeper analysis of evidential activation functions based on our theoretical underpinning inspires the design of a novel regularizer that effectively alleviates this fundamental limitation. Extensive experiments over many challenging real-world datasets and settings confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."
