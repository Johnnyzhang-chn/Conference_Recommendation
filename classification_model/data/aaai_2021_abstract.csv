1,aaai,2021,Unified Tensor Framework for Incomplete Multi-view Clustering and Missing-view Inferring,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i11.17231,"Conventional multi-view clustering seeks to partition data into respective groups based on the assumption that all views are fully observed. However, in practical applications, such as disease diagnosis, multimedia analysis, and recommendation system, it is common to observe that not all views of samples are available in many cases, which leads to the failure of the conventional multi-view clustering methods. Clustering on such incomplete multi-view data is referred to as incomplete multi-view clustering. In view of the promising application prospects, the research of incomplete multi-view clustering has noticeable advances in recent years. However, there is no survey to summarize the current progresses and point out the future research directions. To this end, we review the recent studies of incomplete multi-view clustering. Importantly, we provide some frameworks to unify the corresponding incomplete multi-view clustering methods, and make an in-depth comparative analysis for some representative methods from theoretical and experimental perspectives. Finally, some open problems in the incomplete multi-view clustering field are offered for researchers."
2,aaai,2021,Computing Ex Ante Coordinated Team-Maxmin Equilibria in Zero-Sum Multiplayer Extensive-Form Games,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16728,"Computational game theory has many applications in the modern world in both adversarial situations and the optimization of social good. While there exist many algorithms for computing solutions in two-player interactions, finding optimal strategies in multiplayer interactions efficiently remains an open challenge. This paper focuses on computing the multiplayer Team-Maxmin Equilibrium with Coordination device (TMECor) in zero-sum extensive-form games. TMECor models scenarios when a team of players coordinates ex ante against an adversary. Such situations can be found in card games (e.g., in Bridge and Poker), when a team works together to beat a target player but communication is prohibited; and also in real world, e.g., in forest-protection operations, when coordinated groups have limited contact during interdicting illegal loggers. The existing algorithms struggle to find a TMECor efficiently because of their high computational costs. To compute a TMECor in larger games, we make the following key contributions: (1) we propose a hybrid-form strategy representation for the team, which preserves the set of equilibria; (2) we introduce a column-generation algorithm with a guaranteed finite-time convergence in the infinite strategy space based on a novel best-response oracle; (3) we develop an associated-representation technique for the exact representation of the multilinear terms in the best-response oracle; and (4) we experimentally show that our algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than prior state-of-the-art algorithms in large games."
3,aaai,2021,Submodel Decomposition Bounds for Influence Diagrams,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17442,"Using the concept of strong necessary conditions (CSNC), we derive a complete decomposition of the minimal Skyrme model into a sum of three coupled BPS submodels with the same topological bound. The bounds are saturated if corresponding Bogomolny equations, different for each submodel, are obeyed."
4,aaai,2021,Data-Driven Multimodal Patrol Planning for Anti-poaching,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17792,"Patrolling Games were introduced by Alpern, Morton and Papadaki (2011) to model the adversarial problem where a mobile Patroller can thwart an attack at some location only by visiting it during the attack period, which has a prescribed integer duration m. Here, we modify the problem by allowing the Attacker to go to his planned attack location early and observe the presence or the absence there of the Patroller (who wears a uniform). To avoid being too predictable, the Patroller may sometimes remain at her base when she could have been visiting a possible attack location. The Attacker can then choose to delay attacking for some number of periods d after the Patroller leaves his planned attack location. As shown here, this extra information for the Attacker can reduce thwarted attacks by as much as a factor of four in specific models. Our main finding, is that the attack should begin in the second period the Patroller is away (d = 2) and that the Patroller should never attack the same location in consecutive periods."
5,aaai,2021,PointINet: Point Cloud Frame Interpolation Network,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i3.16324,"LiDAR point cloud frame interpolation, which synthesizes the intermediate frame between the captured frames, has emerged as an important issue for many applications. Especially for reducing the amounts of point cloud transmission, it is by predicting the intermediate frame based on the reference frames to upsample data to high frame rate ones. However, due to high-dimensional and sparse characteristics of point clouds, it is more difficult to predict the intermediate frame for LiDAR point clouds than videos. In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR point cloud frame interpolation method, which exploits range images (RIs) as an intermediate representation with CNNs to conduct the frame interpolation process. Considering the inherited characteristics of RIs differ from that of color images, we introduce spatially adaptive convolutions to extract range features adaptively, while a high-efficient flow estimation method is presented to generate optical flows. The proposed model then warps the input frames and range features, based on the optical flows to synthesize the interpolated frame. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset have clearly demonstrated that our method consistently achieves superior frame interpolation results with better perceptual quality to that of using state-of-the-art video frame interpolation methods. The proposed method could be integrated into any LiDAR point cloud compression systems for inter prediction."
6,aaai,2021,Achieving Envy-freeness and Equitability with Monetary Transfers,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16645,"When allocating indivisible resources or tasks, an envy-free allocation or equitable allocation may not exist. We present a sufficient condition and an algorithm to achieve envy-freeness and equitability when monetary transfers are allowed. The approach works for any agent valuation functions (positive or negative) as long as they satisfy superadditivity. For the case of additive utilities, we present a characterization of allocations that can simultaneously be made equitable and envy-free via payments."
7,aaai,2021,A Model of Winners Allocation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16722,"Random allocation models used in clinical trials aid researchers in determining which of a particular treatment provides the best results by reducing bias between groups. Often however, this determination leaves researchers battling ethical issues of providing patients with unfavorable treatments. Many methods such as Play the Winner and Randomized Play the Winner Rule have historically been utilized to determine patient allocation, however, these methods are prone to the increased assignment of unfavorable treatments. Recently a new Bayesian Method using Decreasingly Informative Priors has been proposed by \citep{sabo2014adaptive}, and later \citep{donahue2020allocation}. Yet this method can be time consuming if MCMC methods are required. We propose the use of a new method which uses Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) \citep{harrison1999bayesian} to increase allocation speed while also decreasing patient allocation samples necessary to identify the more favorable treatment. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on multiple parameters. Finally, a Bayes Factor is calculated to determine the proportion of unused patient budget remaining at a specified cut off and this will be used to determine decisive evidence in favor of the better treatment."
8,aaai,2021,Reaching Individually Stable Coalition Structures in Hedonic Games,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16658,"The formal study of coalition formation in multi-agent systems is typically realized in the framework of hedonic games, which originate from economic theory. The main focus of this branch of research has been on the existence and the computational complexity of deciding the existence of coalition structures that satisfy various stability criteria. The actual process of forming coalitions based on individual behavior has received little attention. In this paper, we study the convergence of simple dynamics leading to stable partitions in a variety of established classes of hedonic games including anonymous, dichotomous, fractional, and hedonic diversity games. The dynamics we consider is based on individual stability: an agent will join another coalition if she is better off and no member of the welcoming coalition is worse off.   Our results are threefold. First, we identify conditions for the (fast) convergence of our dynamics. To this end, we develop new techniques based on the simultaneous usage of multiple intertwined potential functions and establish a reduction uncovering a close relationship between anonymous hedonic games and hedonic diversity games. Second, we provide elaborate counterexamples determining tight boundaries for the existence of individually stable partitions. Third, we study the computational complexity of problems related to the coalition formation dynamics. In particular, we settle open problems suggested by Bogomolnaia and Jackson (2002), Brandl et al. (2005), and Boehmer and Elkind (2020)."
9,aaai,2021,Optimal Kidney Exchange with Immunosuppressants,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16073,"Algorithms for exchange of kidneys is one of the key successful applications in market design, artificial intelligence, and operations research. Potent immunosuppressant drugs suppress the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ up to the point that a transplant across blood- or tissue-type incompatibility becomes possible. In contrast to the standard kidney exchange problem, we consider a setting that also involves the decision about which recipients receive from the limited supply of immunosuppressants that make them compatible with originally incompatible kidneys. We firstly present a general computational framework to model this problem. Our main contribution is a range of efficient algorithms that provide flexibility in terms of meeting meaningful objectives. Motivated by the current reality of kidney exchanges using sophisticated mathematical-programming-based clearing algorithms, we then present a general but scalable approach to optimal clearing with immunosuppression; we validate our approach on realistic data from a large fielded exchange."
10,aaai,2021,Distribution Matching for Rationalization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17547,"The task of rationalization aims to extract pieces of input text as rationales to justify neural network predictions on text classification tasks. By definition, rationales represent key text pieces used for prediction and thus should have similar classification feature distribution compared to the original input text. However, previous methods mainly focused on maximizing the mutual information between rationales and labels while neglecting the relationship between rationales and input text. To address this issue, we propose a novel rationalization method that matches the distributions of rationales and input text in both the feature space and output space. Empirically, the proposed distribution matching approach consistently outperforms previous methods by a large margin. Our data and code are available."
11,aaai,2021,EasyASR: A Distributed Machine Learning Platform for End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.18028,"We present EasyASR, a distributed machine learning platform for training and serving large-scale Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, as well as collecting and processing audio data at scale. Our platform is built upon the Machine Learning Platform for AI of Alibaba Cloud. Its main functionality is to support efficient learning and inference for end-to-end ASR models on distributed GPU clusters. It allows users to learn ASR models with either pre-defined or user-customized network architectures via simple user interface. On EasyASR, we have produced state-of-the-art results over several public datasets for Mandarin speech recognition."
12,aaai,2021,Visual Pivoting for (Unsupervised) Entity Alignment,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16550,"This work studies the use of visual semantic representations to align entities in heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs). Images are natural components of many existing KGs. By combining visual knowledge with other auxiliary information, we show that the proposed new approach, EVA, creates a holistic entity representation that provides strong signals for cross-graph entity alignment. Besides, previous entity alignment methods require human labelled seed alignment, restricting availability. EVA provides a completely unsupervised solution by leveraging the visual similarity of entities to create an initial seed dictionary (visual pivots). Experiments on benchmark data sets DBP15k and DWY15k show that EVA offers state-of-the-art performance on both monolingual and cross-lingual entity alignment tasks. Furthermore, we discover that images are particularly useful to align long-tail KG entities, which inherently lack the structural contexts necessary for capturing the correspondences."
13,aaai,2021,SA-BNN: State-Aware Binary Neural Network,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i3.16306,"Binary neural networks have attracted tremendous attention due to the efficiency for deploying them on mobile devices. Since the weak expression ability of binary weights and features, their accuracy is usually much lower than that of full-precision (i.e. 32-bit) models. Here we present a new frame work for automatically searching for compact but accurate binary neural networks. In practice, number of channels in each layer will be encoded into the search space and optimized using the evolutionary algorithm. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets and neural architectures demonstrate that our searched binary networks can achieve the performance of full-precision models with acceptable increments on model sizes and calculations."
14,aaai,2021,Argument Mining Driven Analysis of Peer-Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16607,"Peer reviewing is a central process in modern research and essential for ensuring high quality and reliability of published work. At the same time, it is a time-consuming process and increasing interest in emerging fields often results in a high review workload, especially for senior researchers in this area. How to cope with this problem is an open question and it is vividly discussed across all major conferences. In this work, we propose an Argument Mining based approach for the assistance of editors, meta-reviewers, and reviewers. We demonstrate that the decision process in the field of scientific publications is driven by arguments and automatic argument identification is helpful in various use-cases. One of our findings is that arguments used in the peer-review process differ from arguments in other domains making the transfer of pre-trained models difficult. Therefore, we provide the community with a new peer-review dataset from different computer science conferences with annotated arguments. In our extensive empirical evaluation, we show that Argument Mining can be used to efficiently extract the most relevant parts from reviews, which are paramount for the publication decision. The process remains interpretable since the extracted arguments can be highlighted in a review without detaching them from their context."
15,aaai,2021,The Maximin Support Method: An Extension of the D&apos;Hondt Method to Approval-Based Multiwinner Elections,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16714,"We propose the maximin support method, a novel extension of the D'Hondt apportionment method to approval-based multiwinner elections. The maximin support method is based on maximizing the support of the least supported elected candidate. It can be computed efficiently and satisfies (adjusted versions of) the main properties of the original D'Hondt method: house monotonicity, population monotonicity, and proportional representation. We also establish a close relationship between the maximin support method and Phragm\'{e}n's voting rules."
16,aaai,2021,StatEcoNet: Statistical Ecology Neural Networks for Species Distribution Modeling,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16129,"This paper focuses on a core task in computational sustainability and statistical ecology: species distribution modeling (SDM). In SDM, the occurrence pattern of a species on a landscape is predicted by environmental features based on observations at a set of locations. At first, SDM may appear to be a binary classification problem, and one might be inclined to employ classic tools (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks) to tackle it. However, wildlife surveys introduce structured noise (especially under-counting) in the species observations. If unaccounted for, these observation errors systematically bias SDMs. To address the unique challenges of SDM, this paper proposes a framework called StatEcoNet. Specifically, this work employs a graphical generative model in statistical ecology to serve as the skeleton of the proposed computational framework and carefully integrates neural networks under the framework. The advantages of StatEcoNet over related approaches are demonstrated on simulated datasets as well as bird species data. Since SDMs are critical tools for ecological science and natural resource management, StatEcoNet may offer boosted computational and analytical powers to a wide range of applications that have significant social impacts, e.g., the study and conservation of threatened species."
17,aaai,2021,"Almost Envy-freeness, Envy-rank, and Nash Social Welfare Matchings",https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16675,"Envy-free up to one good (EF1) and envy-free up to any good (EFX) are two well-known extensions of envy-freeness for the case of indivisible items. It is shown that EF1 can always be guaranteed for agents with subadditive valuations. In sharp contrast, it is unknown whether or not an EFX allocation always exists, even for four agents and additive valuations. In addition, the best approximation guarantee for EFX is $(\phi -1) \simeq 0.61$ by Amanitidis et al..   In order to find a middle ground to bridge this gap, in this paper we suggest another fairness criterion, namely envy-freeness up to a random good or EFR, which is weaker than EFX, yet stronger than EF1. For this notion, we provide a polynomial-time $0.73$-approximation allocation algorithm. For our algorithm, we introduce Nash Social Welfare Matching which makes a connection between Nash Social Welfare and envy freeness. We believe Nash Social Welfare Matching will find its applications in future work."
18,aaai,2021,ExGAN: Adversarial Generation of Extreme Samples,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16834,"Mitigating the risk arising from extreme events is a fundamental goal with many applications, such as the modelling of natural disasters, financial crashes, epidemics, and many others. To manage this risk, a vital step is to be able to understand or generate a wide range of extreme scenarios. Existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at generating realistic samples, but seek to generate typical samples, rather than extreme samples. Hence, in this work, we propose ExGAN, a GAN-based approach to generate realistic and extreme samples. To model the extremes of the training distribution in a principled way, our work draws from Extreme Value Theory (EVT), a probabilistic approach for modelling the extreme tails of distributions. For practical utility, our framework allows the user to specify both the desired extremeness measure, as well as the desired extremeness probability they wish to sample at. Experiments on real US Precipitation data show that our method generates realistic samples, based on visual inspection and quantitative measures, in an efficient manner. Moreover, generating increasingly extreme examples using ExGAN can be done in constant time (with respect to the extremeness probability $\tau$), as opposed to the $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\tau})$ time required by the baseline approach."
19,aaai,2021,Rethinking Boundaries: End-To-End Recognition of Discontinuous Mentions with Pointer Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17513,"One of the most complex syntactic representations used in computational linguistics and NLP are discontinuous constituent trees, crucial for representing all grammatical phenomena of languages such as German. Recent advances in dependency parsing have shown that Pointer Networks excel in efficiently parsing syntactic relations between words in a sentence. This kind of sequence-to-sequence models achieve outstanding accuracies in building non-projective dependency trees, but its potential has not been proved yet on a more difficult task. We propose a novel neural network architecture that, by means of Pointer Networks, is able to generate the most accurate discontinuous constituent representations to date, even without the need of Part-of-Speech tagging information. To do so, we internally model discontinuous constituent structures as augmented non-projective dependency structures. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the two widely-used NEGRA and TIGER benchmarks, outperforming previous work by a wide margin."
20,aaai,2021,Contract Scheduling With Predictions,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17394,"Contract scheduling is a general technique that allows to design a system with interruptible capabilities, given an algorithm that is not necessarily interruptible. Previous work on this topic has largely assumed that the interruption is a worst-case deadline that is unknown to the scheduler. In this work, we study the setting in which there is a potentially erroneous prediction concerning the interruption. Specifically, we consider the setting in which the prediction describes the time that the interruption occurs, as well as the setting in which the prediction is obtained as a response to a single or multiple binary queries. For both settings, we investigate tradeoffs between the robustness (i.e., the worst-case performance assuming adversarial prediction) and the consistency (i.e, the performance assuming that the prediction is error-free), both from the side of positive and negative results."
21,aaai,2021,Symbolic Search for Oversubscription Planning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17422,"In classical planning, the goal is to derive a course of actions that allows an intelligent agent to move from any situation it finds itself in to one that satisfies its goals. Classical planning is considered domain-independent, i.e., it is not limited to a particular application and can be used to solve different types of reasoning problems. In practice, however, some properties of a planning problem at hand require an expressive extension of the standard classical planning formalism to capture and model them. Although the importance of many of these extensions is well known, most planners, especially optimal planners, do not support these extended planning formalisms. The lack of support not only limits the use of these planners for certain problems, but even if it is possible to model the problems without these extensions, it often leads to increased effort in modeling or makes modeling practically impossible as the required problem encoding size increases exponentially.   In this thesis, we propose to use symbolic search for cost-optimal planning for different expressive extensions of classical planning, all capturing different aspects of the problem. In particular, we study planning with axioms, planning with state-dependent action costs, oversubscription planning, and top-k planning. For all formalisms, we present complexity and compilability results, highlighting that it is desirable and even necessary to natively support the corresponding features. We analyze symbolic heuristic search and show that the search performance does not always benefit from the use of a heuristic and that the search performance can exponentially deteriorate even under the best possible circumstances, namely the perfect heuristic. This reinforces that symbolic blind search is the dominant symbolic search strategy nowadays, on par with other state-of-the-art cost-optimal planning strategies..."
22,aaai,2021,Learned Extragradient ISTA with Interpretable Residual Structures for Sparse Coding,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17032,"Recently, the study on learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (LISTA) has attracted increasing attentions. A large number of experiments as well as some theories have proved the high efficiency of LISTA for solving sparse coding problems. However, existing LISTA methods are all serial connection. To address this issue, we propose a novel extragradient based LISTA (ELISTA), which has a residual structure and theoretical guarantees. In particular, our algorithm can also provide the interpretability for Res-Net to a certain extent. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that our method attains linear convergence. In practice, extensive empirical results verify the advantages of our method."
23,aaai,2021,Enabling Fast and Universal Audio Adversarial Attack Using Generative Model,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i16.17663,"Recently, the vulnerability of DNN-based audio systems to adversarial attacks has obtained the increasing attention. However, the existing audio adversarial attacks allow the adversary to possess the entire user's audio input as well as granting sufficient time budget to generate the adversarial perturbations. These idealized assumptions, however, makes the existing audio adversarial attacks mostly impossible to be launched in a timely fashion in practice (e.g., playing unnoticeable adversarial perturbations along with user's streaming input). To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose fast audio adversarial perturbation generator (FAPG), which uses generative model to generate adversarial perturbations for the audio input in a single forward pass, thereby drastically improving the perturbation generation speed. Built on the top of FAPG, we further propose universal audio adversarial perturbation generator (UAPG), a scheme crafting universal adversarial perturbation that can be imposed on arbitrary benign audio input to cause misclassification. Extensive experiments show that our proposed FAPG can achieve up to 167X speedup over the state-of-the-art audio adversarial attack methods. Also our proposed UAPG can generate universal adversarial perturbation that achieves much better attack performance than the state-of-the-art solutions."
24,aaai,2021,Proportionally Representative Participatory Budgeting with Ordinal Preferences,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16646,"Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic paradigm whereby voters decide on a set of projects to fund with a limited budget. We consider PB in a setting where voters report ordinal preferences over projects and have (possibly) asymmetric weights. We propose proportional representation axioms and clarify how they fit into other preference aggregation settings, such as multi-winner voting and approval-based multi-winner voting. As a result of our study, we also discover a new solution concept for approval-based multi-winner voting, which we call Inclusion PSC (IPSC). IPSC is stronger than proportional justified representation (PJR), incomparable to extended justified representation (EJR), and yet compatible with EJR. The well-studied Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule produces a committee that satisfies both EJR and IPSC; however, both these axioms can also be satisfied by an algorithm that runs in polynomial-time."
25,aaai,2021,Camera-Aware Proxies for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i4.16381,"Person re-identification (Re-ID) has been a significant research topic in the past decade due to its real-world applications and research significance. While supervised person Re-ID methods achieve superior performance over unsupervised counterparts, they can not scale to large unlabelled datasets and new domains due to the prohibitive labelling cost. Therefore, unsupervised person Re-ID has drawn increasing attention for its potential to address the scalability issue in person Re-ID. Unsupervised person Re-ID is challenging primarily due to lacking identity labels to supervise person feature learning. The corresponding solutions are diverse and complex, with various merits and limitations. Therefore, comprehensive surveys on this topic are essential to summarise challenges and solutions to foster future research. Existing person Re-ID surveys have focused on supervised methods from classifications and applications but lack detailed discussion on how the person Re-ID solutions address the underlying challenges. This survey review recent works on unsupervised person Re-ID from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of highly influential methods considering the four significant challenges in unsupervised person Re-ID: 1) lacking ground-truth identity labels to supervise person feature learning; 2) learning discriminative person features with pseudo-supervision; 3) learning cross-camera invariant person feature, and 4) the domain shift between datasets. We summarise and analyse evaluation results and provide insights on the effectiveness of the solutions. Finally, we discuss open issues and suggest some promising future research directions."
26,aaai,2021,Encoder-Decoder Based Unified Semantic Role Labeling with Label-Aware Syntax,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17514,"Semantic role labeling (SRL) aims to identify the predicate-argument structure of a sentence. Inspired by the strong correlation between syntax and semantics, previous works pay much attention to improve SRL performance on exploiting syntactic knowledge, achieving significant results. Pipeline methods based on automatic syntactic trees and multi-task learning (MTL) approaches using standard syntactic trees are two common research orientations. In this paper, we adopt a simple unified span-based model for both span-based and word-based Chinese SRL as a strong baseline. Besides, we present a MTL framework that includes the basic SRL module and a dependency parser module. Different from the commonly used hard parameter sharing strategy in MTL, the main idea is to extract implicit syntactic representations from the dependency parser as external inputs for the basic SRL model. Experiments on the benchmarks of Chinese Proposition Bank 1.0 and CoNLL-2009 Chinese datasets show that our proposed framework can effectively improve the performance over the strong baselines. With the external BERT representations, our framework achieves new state-of-the-art 87.54 and 88.5 F1 scores on the two test data of the two benchmarks, respectively. In-depth analysis are conducted to gain more insights on the proposed framework and the effectiveness of syntax."
27,aaai,2021,Lifelong and Continual Learning Dialogue Systems: Learning during Conversation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17768,"Dialogue systems, commonly known as chatbots, have gained escalating popularity in recent times due to their wide-spread applications in carrying out chit-chat conversations with users and task-oriented dialogues to accomplish various user tasks. Existing chatbots are usually trained from pre-collected and manually-labeled data and/or written with handcrafted rules. Many also use manually-compiled knowledge bases (KBs). Their ability to understand natural language is still limited, and they tend to produce many errors resulting in poor user satisfaction. Typically, they need to be constantly improved by engineers with more labeled data and more manually compiled knowledge. This book introduces the new paradigm of lifelong learning dialogue systems to endow chatbots the ability to learn continually by themselves through their own self-initiated interactions with their users and working environments to improve themselves. As the systems chat more and more with users or learn more and more from external sources, they become more and more knowledgeable and better and better at conversing. The book presents the latest developments and techniques for building such continual learning dialogue systems that continuously learn new language expressions and lexical and factual knowledge during conversation from users and off conversation from external sources, acquire new training examples during conversation, and learn conversational skills. Apart from these general topics, existing works on continual learning of some specific aspects of dialogue systems are also surveyed. The book concludes with a discussion of open challenges for future research."
28,aaai,2021,Asking the Right Questions: Learning Interpretable Action Models Through Query Answering,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17428,"This paper develops a new approach for estimating an interpretable, relational model of a black-box autonomous agent that can plan and act. Our main contributions are a new paradigm for estimating such models using a minimal query interface with the agent, and a hierarchical querying algorithm that generates an interrogation policy for estimating the agent's internal model in a vocabulary provided by the user. Empirical evaluation of our approach shows that despite the intractable search space of possible agent models, our approach allows correct and scalable estimation of interpretable agent models for a wide class of black-box autonomous agents. Our results also show that this approach can use predicate classifiers to learn interpretable models of planning agents that represent states as images."
29,aaai,2021,KEML: A Knowledge-Enriched Meta-Learning Framework for Lexical Relation Classification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i15.17640,"Lexical relations describe how concepts are semantically related, in the form of relation triples. The accurate prediction of lexical relations between concepts is challenging, due to the sparsity of patterns indicating the existence of such relations. We propose the Knowledge-Enriched Meta-Learning (KEML) framework to address the task of lexical relation classification. In KEML, the LKB-BERT (Lexical Knowledge Base-BERT) model is presented to learn concept representations from massive text corpora, with rich lexical knowledge injected by distant supervision. A probabilistic distribution of auxiliary tasks is defined to increase the model's ability to recognize different types of lexical relations. We further combine a meta-learning process over the auxiliary task distribution and supervised learning to train the neural lexical relation classifier. Experiments over multiple datasets show that KEML outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
30,aaai,2021,EECBS: A Bounded-Suboptimal Search for Multi-Agent Path Finding,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17466,"Navigational queries for graph-structured data, such as the regular path queries and the context-free path queries, are usually evaluated to a relation of node-pairs $(m, n)$ such that there is a path from $m$ to $n$ satisfying the conditions of the query. Although this relational query semantics has practical value, we believe that the relational query semantics can only provide limited insight in the structure of the graph data. To address the limits of the relational query semantics, we introduce the all-path query semantics and the single-path query semantics. Under these path-based query semantics, a query is evaluated to all paths satisfying the conditions of the query, or, respectively, to a single such path.   While focusing on context-free path queries, we provide a formal framework for evaluating queries on graphs using both path-based query semantics. For the all-path query semantics, we show that the result of a query can be represented by a finite context-free grammar annotated with node-information relevant for deriving each path in the query result. For the single-path query semantics, we propose to search for a path of minimum length. We reduce the problem of finding such a path of minimum length to finding a string of minimum length in a context-free language, and for deriving such a string we propose a novel algorithm.   Our initial results show that the path-based query semantics have added practical value and that query evaluation for both path-based query semantics is feasible, even when query results grow very large. For the single-path query semantics, determining strict worst-case upper bounds on the size of the query result remains the focus of future work."
31,aaai,2021,Debiasing Evaluations That Are Biased by Evaluations,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i11.17214,"Pre-trained language models trained on large-scale data have learned serious levels of social biases. Consequently, various methods have been proposed to debias pre-trained models. Debiasing methods need to mitigate only discriminatory bias information from the pre-trained models, while retaining information that is useful for the downstream tasks. In previous research, whether useful information is retained has been confirmed by the performance of downstream tasks in debiased pre-trained models. On the other hand, it is not clear whether these benchmarks consist of data pertaining to social biases and are appropriate for investigating the impact of debiasing. For example in gender-related social biases, data containing female words (e.g. ``she, female, woman''), male words (e.g. ``he, male, man''), and stereotypical words (e.g. ``nurse, doctor, professor'') are considered to be the most affected by debiasing. If there is not much data containing these words in a benchmark dataset for a target task, there is the possibility of erroneously evaluating the effects of debiasing. In this study, we compare the impact of debiasing on performance across multiple downstream tasks using a wide-range of benchmark datasets that containing female, male, and stereotypical words. Experiments show that the effects of debiasing are consistently \emph{underestimated} across all tasks. Moreover, the effects of debiasing could be reliably evaluated by separately considering instances containing female, male, and stereotypical words than all of the instances in a benchmark dataset."

With large volumes of available questions, it is important to have an automated way to quantify their properties and intelligently select them for students, enabling effective and personalized learning experiences. In this work, we propose a framework for mining insights from educational questions at scale. We utilize the state-of-the-art Bayesian deep learning method, in particular partial variational auto-encoders (p-VAE), to analyze real students' answers to a large collection of questions. Based on p-VAE, we propose two novel metrics that quantify question quality and difficulty, respectively, and a personalized strategy to adaptively select questions for students. We apply our proposed framework to a real-world dataset with tens of thousands of questions and tens of millions of answers from an online education platform. Our framework not only demonstrates promising results in terms of statistical metrics but also obtains highly consistent results with domain experts' evaluation."

In this paper, we study the lifelong variant of MAPF, where agents are constantly engaged with new goal locations, such as in large-scale automated warehouses. We propose a new framework Rolling-Horizon Collision Resolution (RHCR) for solving lifelong MAPF by decomposing the problem into a sequence of Windowed MAPF instances, where a Windowed MAPF solver resolves collisions among the paths of the agents only within a bounded time horizon and ignores collisions beyond it. RHCR is particularly well suited to generating pliable plans that adapt to continually arriving new goal locations. We empirically evaluate RHCR with a variety of MAPF solvers and show that it can produce high-quality solutions for up to 1,000 agents (= 38.9\% of the empty cells on the map) for simulated warehouse instances, significantly outperforming existing work."
34,aaai,2021,Role of Optimizer on Network Fine-tuning for Adversarial Robustness (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17869,"Adversarial examples for neural network image classifiers are known to be transferable: examples optimized to be misclassified by a source classifier are often misclassified as well by classifiers with different architectures. However, targeted adversarial examples -- optimized to be classified as a chosen target class -- tend to be less transferable between architectures. While prior research on constructing transferable targeted attacks has focused on improving the optimization procedure, in this work we examine the role of the source classifier. Here, we show that training the source classifier to be ""slightly robust"" -- that is, robust to small-magnitude adversarial examples -- substantially improves the transferability of class-targeted and representation-targeted adversarial attacks, even between architectures as different as convolutional neural networks and transformers. The results we present provide insight into the nature of adversarial examples as well as the mechanisms underlying so-called ""robust"" classifiers."

In particular, we consider online search, in which the performance of the search strategy is evaluated by its worst case competitive ratio. We introduce a multi-criteria search problem in which the searcher has a budget on its allotted search time, and the objective is to design strategies that are competitively efficient, respect the budget, and maximize the total searched ground. We give analytically optimal strategies for the line and the star environments, and efficient heuristics for general networks."

Exploiting our algorithms, we propagate the lower and upper probability bounds associated with the conditional assertions of a given knowledge base, automatically obtaining the precise probability bounds for the derived conclusions of the inference rules. This allows a more flexible and realistic use of System P in default reasoning and provides an exact illustration of the degradation of the inference rules when interpreted in probabilistic terms. We also examine the disjunctive Weak Rational Monotony of System P+ proposed by Adams in his extended probability logic."

Preferences are combined to define a preferential interpretation in which defeasible inclusions can be evaluated. The construction of the concept-aware multipreference semantics is related to Brewka's framework for qualitative preferences.

The recent work on explanations for argumentation-based conclusions has mostly focused on providing minimal explanations for the (non-)acceptance of arguments. What is still lacking, however, is a proper argumentation-based interpretation of contrastive explanations. We show under which conditions contrastive explanations in abstract and structured argumentation are meaningful, and how argumentation allows us to make implicit foils explicit."

The main ingredients to construct a function measuring fairness in this problem are the use of: (1) ordered weighted averaging operators, a family of aggregation criteria very popular to solve multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems; and (2) $\alpha$-fairness operators which allow to generalize most of the equity measures. A general mathematical optimization model is derived which captures the notion of fairness in maximal covering location problems. The models are firstly formulated as mixed integer non-linear optimization problems for both the discrete and the continuous location spaces. Suitable mixed integer second order cone optimization reformulations are derived using geometric properties of the problem. Finally, the paper concludes with the results obtained on an extensive battery of computational experiments on real datasets. The obtained results support the convenience of the proposed approach."
40,aaai,2021,How Do We Move: Modeling Human Movement with System Dynamics,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16571,"Modeling how human moves in the space is useful for policy-making in transportation, public safety, and public health. Human movements can be viewed as a dynamic process that human transits between states (\eg, locations) over time. In the human world where intelligent agents like humans or vehicles with human drivers play an important role, the states of agents mostly describe human activities, and the state transition is influenced by both the human decisions and physical constraints from the real-world system (\eg, agents need to spend time to move over a certain distance). Therefore, the modeling of state transition should include the modeling of the agent's decision process and the physical system dynamics. In this paper, we propose \ours to model state transition in human movement from a novel perspective, by learning the decision model and integrating the system dynamics. \ours learns the human movement with Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning and integrates the stochastic constraints from system dynamics in the learning process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn to model the state transition of moving agents with system dynamics. In extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method can generate trajectories similar to real-world ones, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods in predicting the next location and generating long-term future trajectories."
41,aaai,2021,Retrospective Reader for Machine Reading Comprehension,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i16.17705,"Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is an AI challenge that requires machine to determine the correct answers to questions based on a given passage. MRC systems must not only answer question when necessary but also distinguish when no answer is available according to the given passage and then tactfully abstain from answering. When unanswerable questions are involved in the MRC task, an essential verification module called verifier is especially required in addition to the encoder, though the latest practice on MRC modeling still most benefits from adopting well pre-trained language models as the encoder block by only focusing on the ""reading"". This paper devotes itself to exploring better verifier design for the MRC task with unanswerable questions. Inspired by how humans solve reading comprehension questions, we proposed a retrospective reader (Retro-Reader) that integrates two stages of reading and verification strategies: 1) sketchy reading that briefly investigates the overall interactions of passage and question, and yield an initial judgment; 2) intensive reading that verifies the answer and gives the final prediction. The proposed reader is evaluated on two benchmark MRC challenge datasets SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Significance tests show that our model is significantly better than the strong ELECTRA and ALBERT baselines. A series of analysis is also conducted to interpret the effectiveness of the proposed reader."

We thus try to evaluate the generation faithfulness with two entity-centric metrics: table record coverage and the ratio of hallucinated entities in text, both of which are shown to have strong agreement with human judgements. Then based on these metrics, we quantitatively analyze the correlation between training data quality and generation fidelity which indicates the potential usage of entity information in faithful generation. Motivated by these findings, we propose two methods for faithful generation: 1) augmented training by incorporating the auxiliary entity information, including both an augmented plan-based model and an unsupervised model and 2) training instance selection based on faithfulness ranking. We show these approaches improve generation fidelity in both full dataset setting and few shot learning settings by both automatic and human evaluations."

Our approach is motivated by the observation that complex syntactic structures and related phenomena, such as nested subordinations and nominal predicates, are not handled well by existing models. Our model treats such instances as sub-sequences of lexicalized dependency paths and learns suitable embedding representations. We experimentally demonstrate that such embeddings can improve results over previous state-of-the-art semantic role labelers, and showcase qualitative improvements obtained by our method."

In this work, we propose an indicator to measure the robustness of neural network parameters by exploiting their vulnerability via parameter corruption. The proposed indicator describes the maximum loss variation in the non-trivial worst-case scenario under parameter corruption. For practical purposes, we give a gradient-based estimation, which is far more effective than random corruption trials that can hardly induce the worst accuracy degradation. Equipped with theoretical support and empirical validation, we are able to systematically investigate the robustness of different model parameters and reveal vulnerability of deep neural networks that has been rarely paid attention to before. Moreover, we can enhance the models accordingly with the proposed adversarial corruption-resistant training, which not only improves the parameter robustness but also translates into accuracy elevation."

In this work, we propose the first unsupervised abstractive dialogue summarization model for tete-a-tetes (SuTaT). Unlike standard text summarization, a dialogue summarization method should consider the multi-speaker scenario where the speakers have different roles, goals, and language styles. In a tete-a-tete, such as a customer-agent conversation, SuTaT aims to summarize for each speaker by modeling the customer utterances and the agent utterances separately while retaining their correlations. SuTaT consists of a conditional generative module and two unsupervised summarization modules. The conditional generative module contains two encoders and two decoders in a variational autoencoder framework where the dependencies between two latent spaces are captured. With the same encoders and decoders, two unsupervised summarization modules equipped with sentence-level self-attention mechanisms generate summaries without using any annotations. Experimental results show that SuTaT is superior on unsupervised dialogue summarization for both automatic and human evaluations, and is capable of dialogue classification and single-turn conversation generation."

Unfortunately, most of the problems described by influence diagrams are hard to solve. In this paper we discuss the complexity of approximately solving influence diagrams.

Remarkably, we show that when both the tree-width and the cardinality of the variables are bounded the problem admits a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme."
47,aaai,2021,Relation-Aware Neighborhood Matching Model for Entity Alignment,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16606,"Entity alignment which aims at linking entities with the same meaning from different knowledge graphs (KGs) is a vital step for knowledge fusion. Existing research focused on learning embeddings of entities by utilizing structural information of KGs for entity alignment. These methods can aggregate information from neighboring nodes but may also bring noise from neighbors. Most recently, several researchers attempted to compare neighboring nodes in pairs to enhance the entity alignment. However, they ignored the relations between entities which are also important for neighborhood matching. In addition, existing methods paid less attention to the positive interactions between the entity alignment and the relation alignment. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel Relation-aware Neighborhood Matching model named RNM for entity alignment. Specifically, we propose to utilize the neighborhood matching to enhance the entity alignment. Besides comparing neighbor nodes when matching neighborhood, we also try to explore useful information from the connected relations. Moreover, an iterative framework is designed to leverage the positive interactions between the entity alignment and the relation alignment in a semi-supervised manner. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model RNM performs better than state-of-the-art methods."
48,aaai,2021,Power up! Robust Graph Convolutional Network via Graph Powering,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16976,"Graph neural networks have emerged as a powerful model for graph representation learning to undertake graph-level prediction tasks. Various graph pooling methods have been developed to coarsen an input graph into a succinct graph-level representation through aggregating node embeddings obtained via graph convolution. However, most graph pooling methods are heavily node-centric and are unable to fully leverage the crucial information contained in global graph structure. This paper presents a cross-view graph pooling (Co-Pooling) method to better exploit crucial graph structure information. The proposed Co-Pooling fuses pooled representations learnt from both node view and edge view. Through cross-view interaction, edge-view pooling and node-view pooling seamlessly reinforce each other to learn more informative graph-level representations. Co-Pooling has the advantage of handling various graphs with different types of node attributes. Extensive experiments on a total of 15 graph benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its superior performance over state-of-the-art pooling methods on both graph classification and graph regression tasks."

Most of the current works focus on either static or dynamic graph settings, addressing a single particular task, e.g., node/graph classification, link prediction. In this work, we investigate the question: can GNNs be applied to continuously learning a sequence of tasks? Towards that, we explore the Continual Graph Learning (CGL) paradigm and present the Experience Replay based framework ER-GNN for CGL to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem in existing GNNs. ER-GNN stores knowledge from previous tasks as experiences and replays them when learning new tasks to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting issue. We propose three experience node selection strategies: mean of feature, coverage maximization, and influence maximization, to guide the process of selecting experience nodes. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our ER-GNN and shed light on the incremental graph (non-Euclidean) structure learning."

While some tasks deal with identifying the presence of sentiment in the text (Subjectivity analysis), other tasks aim at determining the polarity of the text categorizing them as positive, negative and neutral. Whenever there is a presence of sentiment in the text, it has a source (people, group of people or any entity) and the sentiment is directed towards some entity, object, event or person. Sentiment analysis tasks aim to determine the subject, the target and the polarity or valence of the sentiment. In our work, we try to automatically extract sentiment (positive or negative) from Facebook posts using a machine learning approach.While some works have been done in code-mixed social media data and in sentiment analysis separately, our work is the first attempt (as of now) which aims at performing sentiment analysis of code-mixed social media text. We have used extensive pre-processing to remove noise from raw text. Multilayer Perceptron model has been used to determine the polarity of the sentiment. We have also developed the corpus for this task by manually labeling Facebook posts with their associated sentiments."
51,aaai,2021,Adaptive Verifiable Training Using Pairwise Class Similarity,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i11.17223,"Verifiable training has shown success in creating neural networks that are provably robust to a given amount of noise. However, despite only enforcing a single robustness criterion, its performance scales poorly with dataset complexity. On CIFAR10, a non-robust LeNet model has a 21.63% error rate, while a model created using verifiable training and a L-infinity robustness criterion of 8/255, has an error rate of 57.10%. Upon examination, we find that when labeling visually similar classes, the model's error rate is as high as 61.65%. We attribute the loss in performance to inter-class similarity. Similar classes (i.e., close in the feature space) increase the difficulty of learning a robust model. While it's desirable to train a robust model for a large robustness region, pairwise class similarities limit the potential gains. Also, consideration must be made regarding the relative cost of mistaking similar classes. In security or safety critical tasks, similar classes are likely to belong to the same group, and thus are equally sensitive.   In this work, we propose a new approach that utilizes inter-class similarity to improve the performance of verifiable training and create robust models with respect to multiple adversarial criteria. First, we use agglomerate clustering to group similar classes and assign robustness criteria based on the similarity between clusters. Next, we propose two methods to apply our approach: (1) Inter-Group Robustness Prioritization, which uses a custom loss term to create a single model with multiple robustness guarantees and (2) neural decision trees, which trains multiple sub-classifiers with different robustness guarantees and combines them in a decision tree architecture. On Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10, our approach improves clean performance by 9.63% and 30.89% respectively. On CIFAR100, our approach improves clean performance by 26.32%."

This settles positively the 3-dimensional Propeller Conjecture of Khot and Naor (FOCS 2008). The proof of reduces the problem to a finite set of numerical inequalities which are then verified with full rigor in a computer-assisted fashion.

Therefore, Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) is usually considered as the first step for Chinese NER. However, models based on word-level embeddings and lexicon features often suffer from segmentation errors and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In this paper, we investigate a Convolutional Attention Network called CAN for Chinese NER, which consists of a character-based convolutional neural network (CNN) with local-attention layer and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with global self-attention layer to capture the information from adjacent characters and sentence contexts. Also, compared to other models, not depending on any external resources like lexicons and employing small size of char embeddings make our model more practical. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods without word embedding and external lexicon resources on different domain datasets including Weibo, MSRA and Chinese Resume NER dataset."

The main problem of UDA for semantic segmentation relies on reducing the domain gap between the real image and synthetic image. To solve this problem, we focused on separating information in an image into content and style. Here, only the content has cues for semantic segmentation, and the style makes the domain gap. Thus, precise separation of content and style in an image leads to effect as supervision of real data even when learning with synthetic data. To make the best of this effect, we propose a zero-style loss. Even though we perfectly extract content for semantic segmentation in the real domain, another main challenge, the class imbalance problem, still exists in UDA for semantic segmentation. We address this problem by transferring the contents of tail classes from synthetic to real domain. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation on the major two UDA settings."

Specifically, we revisit the benchmark problem of discrete-time linear quadratic regulation (LQR) and study the long-standing open question: Under what conditions is the policy iteration method robustly stable from a dynamical systems perspective? Using advanced stability results in control theory, it is shown that policy iteration for LQR is inherently robust to small errors in the learning process and enjoys small-disturbance input-to-state stability: whenever the error in each iteration is bounded and small, the solutions of the policy iteration algorithm are also bounded, and, moreover, enter and stay in a small neighbourhood of the optimal LQR solution. As an application, a novel off-policy optimistic least-squares policy iteration for the LQR problem is proposed, when the system dynamics are subjected to additive stochastic disturbances. The proposed new results in robust reinforcement learning are validated by a numerical example."

Such models learn to generate data from a given training distribution such that generated images can not be easily distinguished from real images by the human eye. Yet, recent work on the detection of such fake images pointed out that they are actually easily distinguishable by artifacts in their frequency spectra. In this paper, we propose to generate images according to the frequency distribution of the real data by employing a spectral discriminator. The proposed discriminator is lightweight, modular and works stably with different commonly used GAN losses. We show that the resulting models can better generate images with realistic frequency spectra, which are thus harder to detect by this cue."

A central goal for conservation planning and monitoring is the ability to accurately predict the occurrence of species communities and how these communities change over space and time. This in turn leads to a challenging and long-standing problem in the field of computer science - how to perform ac-curate multi-label classification with hundreds of labels? The key challenge of this problem is its exponential-sized output space with regards to the number of labels to be predicted.Therefore, it is essential to facilitate the learning process by exploiting correlations (or dependency) among labels. Previous methods mostly focus on modelling the correlation on label pairs; however, complex relations between real-world objects often go beyond second order. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel framework for multi-label classification, High-order Tie-in Variational Autoencoder (HOT-VAE), which per-forms adaptive high-order label correlation learning. We experimentally verify that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on a bird distribution dataset on both conventional F1 scores and a variety of ecological metrics. To show our method is general, we also perform empirical analysis on seven other public real-world datasets in several application domains, and Hot-VAE exhibits superior performance to previous methods."

One way to reach a consensus is by aggregating individual information, such as decisions, beliefs, preferences and constraints. Judgment aggregation is a social choice method, which generalises voting, that studies the aggregation of individual judgments regarding the truth-value of logically related propositions. As such, judgment aggregation is applicable for consensus reaching problems in multi agent systems. As other social choice theory, judgment aggregation research is abundant with impossibility results. However, the aim of this tutorial is to give an introduction to the methods of judgment aggregation, not the impossibility results. In particular, the tutorial will introduce the basic frameworks that model judgment aggregation problems and give an overview of the judgment aggregation functions so far developed as well as their social theoretic and computational complexity properties. The focus of the tutorial are consensus reaching problems in multi agent systems that can be modelled as judgment aggregation problems. The desirable properties of a judgment aggregation method applied to these problems are not necessarily the same as properties desirable in legal or political contexts, which is considered to be the native domain of judgment aggregation. After this tutorial the participants are expected to be able to read and understand judgment aggregation literature and have a grasp on the state-of-the-art and open questions in judgment aggregation research of interest to multi agent systems."

Deterministic grammars, such as context-free grammars, have been used to limit the search spaces in equation discovery by providing hard constraints that specify which equations to consider and which not. In this paper, we propose the use of probabilistic context-free grammars in equation discovery. Such grammars encode soft constraints, specifying a prior probability distribution on the space of possible equations. We show that probabilistic grammars can be used to elegantly and flexibly formulate the parsimony principle, that favors simpler equations, through probabilities attached to the rules in the grammars. We demonstrate that the use of probabilistic, rather than deterministic grammars, in the context of a Monte-Carlo algorithm for grammar-based equation discovery, leads to more efficient equation discovery. Finally, by specifying prior probability distributions over equation spaces, the foundations are laid for Bayesian approaches to equation discovery."

Self-training addresses the data scarcity issue of metaphor datasets. That is, instead of solely relying on labelled metaphor datasets which are usually small in size, self-training helps identify potential metaphors from a large-scale unlabelled corpus for metaphor generation. The metaphor weighting mechanism enables our model to focus on the metaphor-related parts of the input (e.g., the comparison of the metaphor and comparator) during model learning and thus improves the metaphoricity of the generated metaphors. Our model is trained on an annotated corpus consisting of 6.3k sentences that contain diverse metaphorical expressions. Experimental results show that our model is able to generate metaphors with better readability and creativity compared to the baseline models, even in the situation where training data is insufficient."

Spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies, inter-station correlations driven by other latent factors, and exogenous factors bring challenges to the short-term forecasts of passenger flow of urban rail transit networks. An innovative deep learning approach, Multi-Graph Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network (MGC-RNN) is proposed to forecast passenger flow in urban rail transit systems to incorporate these complex factors. We propose to use multiple graphs to encode the spatial and other heterogenous inter-station correlations. The temporal dynamics of the inter-station correlations are also modeled via the proposed multi-graph convolutional-recurrent neural network structure. Inflow and outflow of all stations can be collectively predicted with multiple time steps ahead via a sequence to sequence(seq2seq) architecture. The proposed method is applied to the short-term forecasts of passenger flow in Shenzhen Metro, China. The experimental results show that MGC-RNN outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of forecasting accuracy. Besides, it is found that the inter-station driven by network distance, network structure, and recent flow patterns are significant factors for passenger flow forecasting. Moreover, the architecture of LSTM-encoder-decoder can capture the temporal dependencies well. In general, the proposed framework could provide multiple views of passenger flow dynamics for fine prediction and exhibit a possibility for multi-source heterogeneous data fusion in the spatiotemporal forecast tasks."
62,aaai,2021,Land Deformation Prediction via Slope-Aware Graph Neural Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17764,"We introduce Neural Deformation Graphs for globally-consistent deformation tracking and 3D reconstruction of non-rigid objects. Specifically, we implicitly model a deformation graph via a deep neural network. This neural deformation graph does not rely on any object-specific structure and, thus, can be applied to general non-rigid deformation tracking. Our method globally optimizes this neural graph on a given sequence of depth camera observations of a non-rigidly moving object. Based on explicit viewpoint consistency as well as inter-frame graph and surface consistency constraints, the underlying network is trained in a self-supervised fashion. We additionally optimize for the geometry of the object with an implicit deformable multi-MLP shape representation. Our approach does not assume sequential input data, thus enabling robust tracking of fast motions or even temporally disconnected recordings. Our experiments demonstrate that our Neural Deformation Graphs outperform state-of-the-art non-rigid reconstruction approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively, with 64% improved reconstruction and 62% improved deformation tracking performance."

Many different description logics have been developed, and numerous computational problems for these logics have been studied for their computational complexity. However, essentially all complexity analyses of reasoning problems for description logics use the one-dimensional framework of classical complexity theory. The multi-dimensional framework of parameterized complexity theory is able to provide a much more detailed image of the complexity of reasoning problems.   In this paper we argue that the framework of parameterized complexity has a lot to offer for the complexity analysis of description logic reasoning problems---when one takes a progressive and forward-looking view on parameterized complexity tools. We substantiate our argument by means of three case studies. The first case study is about the problem of concept satisfiability for the logic ALC with respect to nearly acyclic TBoxes. The second case study concerns concept satisfiability for ALC concepts parameterized by the number of occurrences of union operators and the number of occurrences of full existential quantification. The third case study offers a critical look at data complexity results from a parameterized complexity point of view. These three case studies are representative for the wide range of uses for parameterized complexity methods for description logic problems."
64,aaai,2021,Rethinking Graph Regularization for Graph Neural Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16586,"The graph Laplacian regularization term is usually used in semi-supervised representation learning to provide graph structure information for a model $f(X)$. However, with the recent popularity of graph neural networks (GNNs), directly encoding graph structure $A$ into a model, i.e., $f(A, X)$, has become the more common approach. While we show that graph Laplacian regularization brings little-to-no benefit to existing GNNs, and propose a simple but non-trivial variant of graph Laplacian regularization, called Propagation-regularization (P-reg), to boost the performance of existing GNN models. We provide formal analyses to show that P-reg not only infuses extra information (that is not captured by the traditional graph Laplacian regularization) into GNNs, but also has the capacity equivalent to an infinite-depth graph convolutional network. We demonstrate that P-reg can effectively boost the performance of existing GNN models on both node-level and graph-level tasks across many different datasets."
65,aaai,2021,A Hybrid Probabilistic Approach for Table Understanding,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16562,"The accurate prediction of short-term electricity prices is vital for effective trading strategies, power plant scheduling, profit maximisation and efficient system operation. However, uncertainties in supply and demand make such predictions challenging. We propose a hybrid model that combines a techno-economic energy system model with stochastic models to address this challenge. The techno-economic model in our hybrid approach provides a deep understanding of the market. It captures the underlying factors and their impacts on electricity prices, which is impossible with statistical models alone. The statistical models incorporate non-techno-economic aspects, such as the expectations and speculative behaviour of market participants, through the interpretation of prices. The hybrid model generates both conventional point predictions and probabilistic forecasts, providing a comprehensive understanding of the market landscape. Probabilistic forecasts are particularly valuable because they account for market uncertainty, facilitating informed decision-making and risk management. Our model delivers state-of-the-art results, helping market participants to make informed decisions and operate their systems more efficiently."
66,aaai,2021,A Reciprocal Embedding Framework For Modelling Mutual Preferences,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17807,"Recently, the reciprocal recommendation, especially for online dating applications, has attracted more and more research attention. Different from conventional recommendation problems, the reciprocal recommendation aims to simultaneously best match users' mutual preferences. Intuitively, the mutual preferences might be affected by a few key attributes that users like or dislike. Meanwhile, the interactions between users' attributes and their key attributes are also important for key attributes selection. Motivated by these observations, in this paper we propose a novel reinforced random convolutional network (RRCN) approach for the reciprocal recommendation task. In particular, we technically propose a novel random CNN component that can randomly convolute non-adjacent features to capture their interaction information and learn feature embeddings of key attributes to make the final recommendation. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning based strategy to integrate with the random CNN component to select salient attributes to form the candidate set of key attributes. We evaluate the proposed RRCN against a number of both baselines and the state-of-the-art approaches on two real-world datasets, and the promising results have demonstrated the superiority of RRCN against the compared approaches in terms of a number of evaluation criteria."

An ideal NLU system should process a language in a way that is not exclusive to a single task or a dataset. Keeping this in mind, we have introduced a novel knowledge driven semantic representation approach for English text. By leveraging the VerbNet lexicon, we are able to map syntax tree of the text to its commonsense meaning represented using basic knowledge primitives. The general purpose knowledge represented from our approach can be used to build any reasoning based NLU system that can also provide justification. We applied this approach to construct two NLU applications that we present here: SQuARE (Semantic-based Question Answering and Reasoning Engine) and StaCACK (Stateful Conversational Agent using Commonsense Knowledge). Both these systems work by ""truly understanding"" the natural language text they process and both provide natural language explanations for their responses while maintaining high accuracy."

Two standard algorithms -- label propagation and graph neural networks -- both operate by repeatedly passing information along edges, the former by passing labels and the latter by passing node features, modulated by neural networks. These two types of algorithms have largely developed separately, and there is little understanding about the structure of network data that would make one of these approaches work particularly well compared to the other or when the approaches can be meaningfully combined. Here, we develop a Markov random field model for the data generation process of node attributes, based on correlations of attributes on and between vertices, that motivates and unifies these algorithmic approaches. We show that label propagation, a linearized graph convolutional network, and their combination can all be derived as conditional expectations under our model, when conditioning on different attributes. In addition, the data model highlights deficiencies in existing graph neural networks (while producing new algorithmic solutions), serves as a rigorous statistical framework for understanding graph learning issues such as over-smoothing, creates a testbed for evaluating inductive learning performance, and provides a way to sample graphs attributes that resemble empirical data. We also find that a new algorithm derived from our data generation model, which we call a Linear Graph Convolution, performs extremely well in practice on empirical data, and provide theoretical justification for why this is the case."

However, the underlying neural network polices have not been widely deployed in real-world applications, especially in these safety-critical tasks (e.g., autonomous driving). One of the reasons is that the learned policy cannot perform flexible and resilient behaviors as traditional methods to adapt to diverse environments. In this paper, we consider the problem that a mobile robot learns adaptive and resilient behaviors for navigating in unseen uncertain environments while avoiding collisions. We present a novel approach for uncertainty-aware navigation by introducing an uncertainty-aware predictor to model the environmental uncertainty, and we propose a novel uncertainty-aware navigation network to learn resilient behaviors in the prior unknown environments. To train the proposed uncertainty-aware network more stably and efficiently, we present the temperature decay training paradigm, which balances exploration and exploitation during the training process. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can learn resilient behaviors in diverse environments and generate adaptive trajectories according to environmental uncertainties."

In this scenario, the input image serves as an intuitive context and background for the search, while the corresponding language expressly requests new traits on how specific characteristics of the query image should be modified in order to get the intended target image. This task is challenging since it necessitates learning and understanding the composite image-text representation by incorporating cross-granular semantic updates. In this paper, we tackle this task by a novel \underline{\textbf{B}}ottom-up cr\underline{\textbf{O}}ss-modal \underline{\textbf{S}}emantic compo\underline{\textbf{S}}ition (\textbf{BOSS}) with Hybrid Counterfactual Training framework, which sheds new light on the CIR task by studying it from two previously overlooked perspectives: \emph{implicitly bottom-up composition of visiolinguistic representation} and \emph{explicitly fine-grained correspondence of query-target construction}. On the one hand, we leverage the implicit interaction and composition of cross-modal embeddings from the bottom local characteristics to the top global semantics, preserving and transforming the visual representation conditioned on language semantics in several continuous steps for effective target image search. On the other hand, we devise a hybrid counterfactual training strategy that can reduce the model's ambiguity for similar queries."
71,aaai,2021,Visual Tracking via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i4.16443,"In this paper, we propose an approach to learn hierarchical features for visual object tracking. First, we offline learn features robust to diverse motion patterns from auxiliary video sequences. The hierarchical features are learned via a two-layer convolutional neural network. Embedding the temporal slowness constraint in the stacked architecture makes the learned features robust to complicated motion transformations, which is important for visual object tracking. Then, given a target video sequence, we propose a domain adaptation module to online adapt the pre-learned features according to the specific target object. The adaptation is conducted in both layers of the deep feature learning module so as to include appearance information of the specific target object. As a result, the learned hierarchical features can be robust to both complicated motion transformations and appearance changes of target objects. We integrate our feature learning algorithm into three tracking methods. Experimental results demonstrate that significant improvement can be achieved using our learned hierarchical features, especially on video sequences with complicated motion transformations."

Compared with unsupervised hashing, supervised hashing methods for labeled data have usually better performance by utilizing semantic label information. Intuitively, for unlabeled data, it will improve the performance of unsupervised hashing methods if we can first mine some supervised semantic 'label information' from unlabeled data and then incorporate the 'label information' into the training process. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel Object Detection based Deep Unsupervised Hashing method (ODDUH). Specifically, a pre-trained object detection model is utilized to mining supervised 'label information', which is used to guide the learning process to generate high-quality hash codes.Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods in the image retrieval task."

However, directly targeting such metrics by off-policy bandit learning objectives often increases the risk of making abrupt policy changes that break the current user experience. In this study, we introduce a scalable framework for supporting fine-grained exploration targets for individual domains via user-defined constraints. For example, we may want to ensure fewer policy deviations in business-critical domains such as shopping, while allocating more exploration budget to domains such as music. Furthermore, we present a novel meta-gradient learning approach that is scalable and practical to address this problem. The proposed method adjusts constraint violation penalty terms adaptively through a meta objective that encourages balanced constraint satisfaction across domains. We conduct extensive experiments using data from a real-world conversational AI on a set of realistic constraint benchmarks. Based on the experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of achieving the best balance between the policy value and constraint satisfaction rate."

This technique has been applied to machine translation, and dialog response generation. Previous work usually used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to generate lexically constrained sentences, but they randomly determined the position to be edited and the action to be taken, resulting in many invalid refinements. To overcome this challenge, we used a classifier to instruct the MCMC-based models where and how to refine the candidate sentences. First, we developed two methods to create synthetic data on which the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to obtain a reliable classifier. Next, we proposed a two-step approach, ""Predict and Revise"", for constrained sentence generation. During the predict step, we leveraged the classifier to compute the learned prior for the candidate sentence. During the revise step, we resorted to MCMC sampling to revise the candidate sentence by conducting a sampled action at a sampled position drawn from the learned prior. We compared our proposed models with many strong baselines on two tasks, generating sentences with lexical constraints and text infilling. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed model performs much better than the previous work in terms of sentence fluency and diversity. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/NLPCode/MCMCXLNet."

However, little research has studied data augmentation on graph neural networks, particularly using augmentation at both train- and test-time. Inspired by the success of augmentation in other domains, we have designed a method for social influence prediction using graph neural networks with train- and test-time augmentation, which can effectively generate multiple augmented graphs for social networks by utilising a variational graph autoencoder in both scenarios. We have evaluated the performance of our method on predicting user influence on multiple social network datasets. Our experimental results show that our end-to-end approach, which jointly trains a graph autoencoder and social influence behaviour classification network, can outperform state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of train- and test-time augmentation on graph neural networks for social influence prediction. We observe that this is particularly effective on smaller graphs."

To deal with image variation (i.e., non-stationary noise), in this paper, we propose multi-kernel filter (MKF) which adapts filtering kernels to specific image characteristics automatically. The design of MKF takes inspiration from adaptive mechanisms of human vision that make full use of information in a visual context. More specifically, for simulating the visual context and its adaptive function, we construct the image context based on which we simulate the contextual impact on filtering kernels. We first design a hierarchically clustering algorithm to generate a hierarchy of large to small coherent image patches, organized as a cluster tree, so that obtain multi-scale image representation. The leaf cluster and corresponding predecessor clusters are used to generate one of multiple range kernels that are capable of catering to image variation. At first, we design a hierarchically clustering framework to generate a hierarchy of large to small coherent image patches that organized as a cluster tree, so that obtain multi-scale image representation, i.e., the image context. Next, a leaf cluster is used to generate one of the multiple kernels, and two corresponding predecessor clusters are used to fine-tune the adopted kernel. Ultimately, the single spatially-invariant kernel in BF becomes multiple spatially-varying ones. We evaluate MKF on two public datasets, BSD300 and BrainWeb which are added integrally-varying noise and spatially-varying noise, respectively. Extensive experiments show that MKF outperforms state-of-the-art filters w.r.t. both mean absolute error and structural similarity."

This notion can be adapted to the context of Description Logic, where the base consists of a set of concept inclusions instead of implications. In this setting, concept expressions can be arbitrarily large. Thus, it is not clear whether a finite base exists and, if so, how large concept expressions may need to be. We first revisit results in the literature for mining EL bases from finite interpretations. Those mainly focus on finding a finite base or on fixing the role depth but potentially losing some of the valid concept inclusions with higher role depth. We then present a new strategy for mining EL bases which is adaptable in the sense that it can bound the role depth of concepts depending on the local structure of the interpretation. Our strategy guarantees to capture all EL concept inclusions holding in the interpretation, not only the ones up to a fixed role depth."

Existing works mostly handle with the problem in consideration of the shape distortion, including perspective distortions, line curvature or other style variations. Therefore, methods based on spatial transformers are extensively studied. However, chromatic difficulties in complex scenes have not been paid much attention on. In this work, we introduce a new learnable geometric-unrelated module, the Structure-Preserving Inner Offset Network (SPIN), which allows the color manipulation of source data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted before any recognition architecture to ease the downstream tasks, giving neural networks the ability to actively transform input intensity rather than the existing spatial rectification. It can also serve as a complementary module to known spatial transformations and work in both independent and collaborative ways with them. Extensive experiments show that the use of SPIN results in a significant improvement on multiple text recognition benchmarks compared to the state-of-the-arts."

We use a fully randomized experiment of 427 trials, where Q-learning bidders participate in up to 250,000 auctions for a commonly valued item. The findings reveal that the first price auction, where winners pay the winning bid, is susceptible to coordinated bid suppression, with winning bids averaging roughly 20% below the true values. In contrast, the second price auction, where winners pay the second highest bid, aligns winning bids with actual values, reduces the volatility during learning and speeds up convergence. Regression analysis, incorporating design elements such as payment rules, number of participants, algorithmic factors including the discount and learning rate, asynchronous/synchronous updating, feedback, and exploration strategies, discovers the critical role of payment rules on efficiency. Furthermore, machine learning estimators find that payment rules matter even more with few bidders, high discount factors, asynchronous learning, and coarse bid spaces. This paper underscores the importance of auction design in algorithmic bidding. It suggests that computerized auctions like Google AdSense, which rely on the first price auction, can mitigate the risk of algorithmic collusion by adopting the second price auction."

It is often challenging for existing machine learning approaches to jointly model genetic pathways (higher-order features) and variants (atomic features), and present to clinicians interpretable models. In order to build more accurate and better interpretable machine learning models for genetic medicine, we introduce Pathway Augmented Nonnegative Tensor factorization for HighER-order feature learning (PANTHER). PANTHER selects informative genetic pathways that directly encode molecular mechanisms. We apply genetically motivated constrained tensor factorization to group pathways in a way that reflects molecular mechanism interactions. We then train a softmax classifier for disease types using the identified pathway groups. We evaluated PANTHER against multiple state-of-the-art constrained tensor/matrix factorization models, as well as group guided and Bayesian hierarchical models. PANTHER outperforms all state-of-the-art comparison models significantly (p<0.05). Our experiments on large scale Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and whole-genome genotyping datasets also demonstrated wide applicability of PANTHER. We performed feature analysis in predicting disease types, which suggested insights and benefits of the identified pathway groups."

We investigate machine teaching for temporal logic formulas -- a novel and expressive hypothesis class amenable to time-related task specifications. In the context of teaching temporal logic formulas, an exhaustive search even for a myopic solution takes exponential time (with respect to the time span of the task). We propose an efficient approach for teaching parametric linear temporal logic formulas. Concretely, we derive a necessary condition for the minimal time length of a demonstration to eliminate a set of hypotheses. Utilizing this condition, we propose a myopic teaching algorithm by solving a sequence of integer programming problems. We further show that, under two notions of teaching complexity, the proposed algorithm has near-optimal performance. The results strictly generalize the previous results on teaching preference-based version space learners. We evaluate our algorithm extensively under a variety of learner types (i.e., learners with different preference models) and interactive protocols (e.g., batched and adaptive). The results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently teach a given target temporal logic formula under various settings, and that there are significant gains of teaching efficacy when the teacher adapts to the learner's current hypotheses or uses oracles."

Many existing trojan attacks have their triggers being input space patches/objects (e.g., a polygon with solid color) or simple input transformations such as Instagram filters. These simple triggers are susceptible to recent backdoor detection algorithms. We propose a novel deep feature space trojan attack with five characteristics: effectiveness, stealthiness, controllability, robustness and reliance on deep features. We conduct extensive experiments on 9 image classifiers on various datasets including ImageNet to demonstrate these properties and show that our attack can evade state-of-the-art defense."

Ideally, natural language should also be usable for communicating goals to autonomous machines (e.g., robots) to minimize friction in task specification. However, understanding and mapping natural language goals to sequences of states and actions is challenging. Specifically, existing work along these lines has encountered difficulty in generalizing learned policies to new natural language goals and environments. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a language-conditioned policy and reward function. To improve generalization of the learned policy and reward function, we use a variational goal generator to relabel trajectories and sample diverse goals during training. Our algorithm outperforms multiple baselines by a large margin on a vision-based natural language instruction following dataset (Room-2-Room), demonstrating a promising advance in enabling the use of natural language instructions in specifying agent goals."

However, most of the multimodal methods use attention mechanisms to extract visual clues regardless of whether the text and image are relevant. Practically, the irrelevant text-image pairs account for a large proportion in tweets. The visual clues that are unrelated to the texts will exert uncertain or even negative effects on multimodal model learning. In this paper, we introduce a method of text-image relation propagation into the multimodal BERT model. We integrate soft or hard gates to select visual clues and propose a multitask algorithm to train on the MNER datasets. In the experiments, we deeply analyze the changes in visual attention before and after the use of text-image relation propagation.

In this paper, we study a new problem setting in which there are unknown classes in the training dataset misperceived as other labels, and thus their existence appears unknown from the given supervision. We attribute the unknown unknowns to the fact that the training dataset is badly advised by the incompletely perceived label space due to the insufficient feature information. To this end, we propose the exploratory machine learning, which examines and investigates the training dataset by actively augmenting the feature space to discover potentially unknown labels. Our approach consists of three ingredients including rejection model, feature acquisition, and model cascade. The effectiveness is validated on both synthetic and real datasets."

To ensure non-discrimination in learning tasks, knowledge of the sensitive attributes is essential, while, in practice, these attributes may not be available due to legal and ethical requirements. To address this challenge, this paper studies a model that protects the privacy of the individuals sensitive information while also allowing it to learn non-discriminatory predictors. The method relies on the notion of differential privacy and the use of Lagrangian duality to design neural networks that can accommodate fairness constraints while guaranteeing the privacy of sensitive attributes. The paper analyses the tension between accuracy, privacy, and fairness and the experimental evaluation illustrates the benefits of the proposed model on several prediction tasks."

(Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17943,"To provide an explanation of the evolution of scientific knowledge, I start from the assumption that knowledge is based on concepts, and propose that each concept about reality is affected by vagueness. This entails a paradox, which I term Knowledge Paradox (KP): i.e. we need concepts to acquire knowledge about the real world but each concept is a step away from reality. The KP provides a unifying context for the sorites and the liar paradoxes. Any concept is viewed as a sorites, i.e. it is impossible to set a boundary between what is, and what is not, the entity to which the concept refers. Hence, any statement about reality can be reduced to a liar, wherefrom the KP follows in its most general form: -If I know, then I do not know-. The KP is self-referential but not contradictory, as it can be referred to two levels of knowledge: -if I know(epistemic), then I do not know(ontic)-, where the ontic level is made unachievable by concept vagueness. Such an interpretation of scientific knowledge provides an understanding of its dynamics. Concept proliferation within theories produces periods of knowledge decay that are episodically reversed by the formulation of new theories based on a smaller number of synthetic concepts."
88,aaai,2021,Online Learning in Variable Feature Spaces under Incomplete Supervision,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16532,"There are threefold challenges in emotion recognition. First, it is difficult to recognize human's emotional states only considering a single modality. Second, it is expensive to manually annotate the emotional data. Third, emotional data often suffers from missing modalities due to unforeseeable sensor malfunction or configuration issues. In this paper, we address all these problems under a novel multi-view deep generative framework. Specifically, we propose to model the statistical relationships of multi-modality emotional data using multiple modality-specific generative networks with a shared latent space. By imposing a Gaussian mixture assumption on the posterior approximation of the shared latent variables, our framework can learn the joint deep representation from multiple modalities and evaluate the importance of each modality simultaneously. To solve the labeled-data-scarcity problem, we extend our multi-view model to semi-supervised learning scenario by casting the semi-supervised classification problem as a specialized missing data imputation task. To address the missing-modality problem, we further extend our semi-supervised multi-view model to deal with incomplete data, where a missing view is treated as a latent variable and integrated out during inference. This way, the proposed overall framework can utilize all available (both labeled and unlabeled, as well as both complete and incomplete) data to improve its generalization ability. The experiments conducted on two real multi-modal emotion datasets demonstrated the superiority of our framework."

ERNIE-ViL tries to build the detailed semantic connections (objects, attributes of objects and relationships between objects) across vision and language, which are essential to vision-language cross-modal tasks. Utilizing scene graphs of visual scenes, ERNIE-ViL constructs Scene Graph Prediction tasks, i.e., Object Prediction, Attribute Prediction and Relationship Prediction tasks in the pre-training phase. Specifically, these prediction tasks are implemented by predicting nodes of different types in the scene graph parsed from the sentence. Thus, ERNIE-ViL can learn the joint representations characterizing the alignments of the detailed semantics across vision and language. After pre-training on large scale image-text aligned datasets, we validate the effectiveness of ERNIE-ViL on 5 cross-modal downstream tasks. ERNIE-ViL achieves state-of-the-art performances on all these tasks and ranks the first place on the VCR leaderboard with an absolute improvement of 3.7%."

However, the large size of 3D volume images poses a great computational challenge to traditional attention methods. In this paper, we propose a folded attention (FA) approach to improve the computational efficiency of traditional attention methods on 3D medical images. The main idea is that we apply tensor folding and unfolding operations with four permutations to build four small sub-affinity matrices to approximate the original affinity matrix. Through four consecutive sub-attention modules of FA, each element in the feature tensor can aggregate spatial-channel information from all other elements. Compared to traditional attention methods, with moderate improvement of accuracy, FA can substantially reduce the computational complexity and GPU memory consumption. We demonstrate the superiority of our method on two challenging tasks for 3D MIR and MIS, which are quantitative susceptibility mapping and multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation."
91,aaai,2021,Self-Supervised Hypergraph Convolutional Networks for Session-based Recommendation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16578,"Session-based recommendation (SBR) focuses on next-item prediction at a certain time point. As user profiles are generally not available in this scenario, capturing the user intent lying in the item transitions plays a pivotal role. Recent graph neural networks (GNNs) based SBR methods regard the item transitions as pairwise relations, which neglect the complex high-order information among items. Hypergraph provides a natural way to capture beyond-pairwise relations, while its potential for SBR has remained unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by modeling session-based data as a hypergraph and then propose a hypergraph convolutional network to improve SBR. Moreover, to enhance hypergraph modeling, we devise another graph convolutional network which is based on the line graph of the hypergraph and then integrate self-supervised learning into the training of the networks by maximizing mutual information between the session representations learned via the two networks, serving as an auxiliary task to improve the recommendation task. Since the two types of networks both are based on hypergraph, which can be seen as two channels for hypergraph modeling, we name our model \textbf{DHCN} (Dual Channel Hypergraph Convolutional Networks). Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the SOTA methods, and the results validate the effectiveness of hypergraph modeling and self-supervised task. The implementation of our model is available at https://github.com/xiaxin1998/DHCN"

We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based model that treats immunohistochemical (IHC) scoring of HER2 as a sequential learning task. For a given image tile sampled from multi-resolution giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI), the model learns to sequentially identify some of the diagnostically relevant regions of interest (ROIs) by following a parameterized policy. The selected ROIs are processed by recurrent and residual convolution networks to learn the discriminative features for different HER2 scores and predict the next location, without requiring to process all the sub-image patches of a given tile for predicting the HER2 score, mimicking the histopathologist who would not usually analyze every part of the slide at the highest magnification. The proposed model incorporates a task-specific regularization term and inhibition of return mechanism to prevent the model from revisiting the previously attended locations. We evaluated our model on two IHC datasets: a publicly available dataset from the HER2 scoring challenge contest and another dataset consisting of WSIs of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor sections stained with Glo1 marker. We demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other methods based on state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using DRL for IHC scoring and could potentially lead to wider use of DRL in the domain of computational pathology reducing the computational burden of the analysis of large multigigapixel histology images."

Existing defense mechanisms rely on model-specific heuristics or noise injection. While being able to mitigate attacks, existing methods significantly hinder model performance. There remains a question of how to design a defense mechanism that is applicable to a variety of models and achieves better utility-privacy tradeoff. In this paper, we propose the Mutual Information Regularization based Defense (MID) against MI attacks. The key idea is to limit the information about the model input contained in the prediction, thereby limiting the ability of an adversary to infer the private training attributes from the model prediction. Our defense principle is model-agnostic and we present tractable approximations to the regularizer for linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, which have been successfully attacked by prior work if not attached with any defenses. We present a formal study of MI attacks by devising a rigorous game-based definition and quantifying the associated information leakage. Our theoretical analysis sheds light on the inefficacy of DP in defending against MI attacks, which has been empirically observed in several prior works. Our experiments demonstrate that MID leads to state-of-the-art performance for a variety of MI attacks, target models and datasets."
94,aaai,2021,Subverting Privacy-Preserving GANs: Hiding Secrets in Sanitized Images,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17743,"Unprecedented data collection and sharing have exacerbated privacy concerns and led to increasing interest in privacy-preserving tools that remove sensitive attributes from images while maintaining useful information for other tasks. Currently, state-of-the-art approaches use privacy-preserving generative adversarial networks (PP-GANs) for this purpose, for instance, to enable reliable facial expression recognition without leaking users' identity. However, PP-GANs do not offer formal proofs of privacy and instead rely on experimentally measuring information leakage using classification accuracy on the sensitive attributes of deep learning (DL)-based discriminators. In this work, we question the rigor of such checks by subverting existing privacy-preserving GANs for facial expression recognition. We show that it is possible to hide the sensitive identification data in the sanitized output images of such PP-GANs for later extraction, which can even allow for reconstruction of the entire input images, while satisfying privacy checks. We demonstrate our approach via a PP-GAN-based architecture and provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations using two public datasets. Our experimental results raise fundamental questions about the need for more rigorous privacy checks of PP-GANs, and we provide insights into the social impact of these."

In reality, token-level annotations (slot labels) are time-consuming and difficult to acquire. In this work, we study the Slot Induction (SI) task whose objective is to induce slot boundaries without explicit knowledge of token-level slot annotations. We propose leveraging Unsupervised Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) Probing and Contrastive Learning mechanism to exploit (1) unsupervised semantic knowledge extracted from PLM, and (2) additional sentence-level intent label signals available from TOD. Our approach is shown to be effective in SI task and capable of bridging the gaps with token-level supervised models on two NLU benchmark datasets. When generalized to emerging intents, our SI objectives also provide enhanced slot label representations, leading to improved performance on the Slot Filling tasks."

Recent works adopt a predict-and-refine strategy which converts an initial prediction to action segments for global context modeling. However, the generated segment representations are often noisy and exhibit inaccurate segment boundaries, over-segmentation and other problems. To deal with these issues, we propose an attention based approach which we call \textit{temporal segment transformer}, for joint segment relation modeling and denoising. The main idea is to denoise segment representations using attention between segment and frame representations, and also use inter-segment attention to capture temporal correlations between segments. The refined segment representations are used to predict action labels and adjust segment boundaries, and a final action segmentation is produced based on voting from segment masks. We show that this novel architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the popular 50Salads, GTEA and Breakfast benchmarks. We also conduct extensive ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of different components of our design."

As training every child model from scratch is very time-consuming, recent works leverage weight-sharing to speed up the model evaluation procedure. These approaches greatly reduce computation by maintaining a single copy of weights on the super-net and share the weights among every child model. However, weight-sharing has no theoretical guarantee and its impact has not been well studied before. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive experiments to reveal the impact of weight-sharing: (1) The best-performing models from different runs or even from consecutive epochs within the same run have significant variance; (2) Even with high variance, we can extract valuable information from training the super-net with shared weights; (3) The interference between child models is a main factor that induces high variance; (4) Properly reducing the degree of weight sharing could effectively reduce variance and improve performance."

Agents whose objectives are aligned, and where one agent can help another achieve greater reward by sacrificing some of its own reward, should choose a cooperative commitment to maximize their joint reward. We present a solution to the problem of how cooperative agents can efficiently find an (approximately) optimal commitment by querying about carefully-selected commitment choices. We prove structural properties of the agents' values as functions of the parameters of the commitment specification, and develop a greedy method for composing a query with provable approximation bounds, which we empirically show can find nearly optimal commitments in a fraction of the time methods that lack our insights require."

However, automatic cervical dysplasia diagnosis via visual inspection, which is more appropriate in low-resource settings, remains a challenging problem. Though promising results have been obtained by recent deep learning models, their performance is significantly hindered by the limited scale of the available cervix datasets. Distinct from previous methods that learn from a single dataset, we propose to leverage cross-domain cervical images that were collected in different but related clinical studies to improve the model's performance on the targeted cervix dataset. To robustly learn the transferable information across datasets, we propose a novel prototype-based knowledge filtering method to estimate the transferability of cross-domain samples. We further optimize the shared feature space by aligning the cross-domain image representations simultaneously on domain level with early alignment and class level with supervised contrastive learning, which endows model training and knowledge transfer with stronger robustness. The empirical results on three real-world benchmark cervical image datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art cervical dysplasia visual inspection by an absolute improvement of 4.7% in top-1 accuracy, 7.0% in precision, 1.4% in recall, 4.6% in F1 score, and 0.05 in ROC-AUC."

However, the redundancy and lengthiness issues of crowdsourced answers limit the performance of answer selection and lead to reading difficulties and misunderstandings for community users. To solve these problems, we tackle the tasks of answer selection and answer summary generation in CQA with a novel joint learning model. Specifically, we design a question-driven pointer-generator network, which exploits the correlation information between question-answer pairs to aid in attending the essential information when generating answer summaries. Meanwhile, we leverage the answer summaries to alleviate noise in original lengthy answers when ranking the relevancy degrees of question-answer pairs. In addition, we construct a new large-scale CQA corpus, WikiHowQA, which contains long answers for answer selection as well as reference summaries for answer summarization. The experimental results show that the joint learning method can effectively address the answer redundancy issue in CQA and achieves state-of-the-art results on both answer selection and text summarization tasks. Furthermore, the proposed model is shown to be of great transferring ability and applicability for resource-poor CQA tasks, which lack of reference answer summaries."

In this paper, we define and quantify the significance of interactions among multiple input variables of the DNN. Input variables with strong interactions usually form a coalition and reflect prototype features, which are memorized and used by the DNN for inference. We define the significance of interactions based on the Shapley value, which is designed to assign the attribution value of each input variable to the inference. We have conducted experiments with various DNNs. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In this paper, we might want to present the Collaborative Neural Network Group (CNNG). CNNG is a progression of neural systems that work cooperatively to deal with various errands independently in a similar learning framework. It is advanced from a solitary neural system by reflection. Along these lines, in light of various circumstances removed by the calculation, the CNNG can perform diverse techniques when handling the information. The examples of chose methodology can be seen by human to make profound adapting more reasonable. In our execution, the CNNG is joined by a few moderately little neural systems. We give a progression of examinations to assess the execution of CNNG contrasted with other learning strategies. The CNNG is able to get a higher accuracy with a much lower training cost. We can reduce the error rate by 74.5% and reached the accuracy of 99.45% in MNIST with three feedforward networks (4 layers) in one training epoch."

However, recent studies demonstrate that these models are vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial samples and suffer from a significant performance drop when predicting them. Many methods have been proposed to improve adversarial robustness (e.g., adversarial training and new loss functions to learn adversarially robust feature representations). Here we offer a unique insight into the predictive behavior of CNNs that they tend to misclassify adversarial samples into the most probable false classes. This inspires us to propose a new Probabilistically Compact (PC) loss with logit constraints which can be used as a drop-in replacement for cross-entropy (CE) loss to improve CNN's adversarial robustness. Specifically, PC loss enlarges the probability gaps between true class and false classes meanwhile the logit constraints prevent the gaps from being melted by a small perturbation. We extensively compare our method with the state-of-the-art using large scale datasets under both white-box and black-box attacks to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Comments not only convey salient and interesting information in news articles, but also imply various and different reader characteristics which we treat as the essential clues for diversity. However, most of the comment generation approaches only focus on saliency information extraction, while the reader-aware factors implied by comments are neglected. To address this issue, we propose a unified reader-aware topic modeling and saliency information detection framework to enhance the quality of generated comments. For reader-aware topic modeling, we design a variational generative clustering algorithm for latent semantic learning and topic mining from reader comments. For saliency information detection, we introduce Bernoulli distribution estimating on news content to select saliency information. The obtained topic representations as well as the selected saliency information are incorporated into the decoder to generate diversified and informative comments. Experimental results on three datasets show that our framework outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The potential ethical issues are also discussed in detail."

In this paper, we address the problem of learning vector representations for complex semantic parses that consist of multiple entities and relations. Previous work largely focused on selecting the correct semantic relations for a question and disregarded the structure of the semantic parse: the connections between entities and the directions of the relations. We propose to use Gated Graph Neural Networks to encode the graph structure of the semantic parse. We show on two data sets that the graph networks outperform all baseline models that do not explicitly model the structure. The error analysis confirms that our approach can successfully process complex semantic parses."

Due to various challenges, a localization method is prone to spatial semantic errors, i.e., predicting multiple dots within a same person or collapsing multiple dots in a cluttered region. We propose a topological approach targeting these semantic errors. We introduce a topological constraint that teaches the model to reason about the spatial arrangement of dots. To enforce this constraint, we define a persistence loss based on the theory of persistent homology. The loss compares the topographic landscape of the likelihood map and the topology of the ground truth. Topological reasoning improves the quality of the localization algorithm especially near cluttered regions. On multiple public benchmarks, our method outperforms previous localization methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of our method in improving the performance in the crowd counting task."

We classify these cyber attacks as undetectable in the sense that their impact cannot be observed in the generated residuals. It is shown if an agent that is the root of a rooted spanning tree in the MAS graph is under a cyber attack, the attack is undetectable by the entire network. Next we investigate if a non-root agent is compromised, then under certain conditions cyber attacks can become detectable. Moreover, a novel cyber attack that is designated as quasi-covert cyber attack is introduced that can be used to eliminate detectable impacts of cyber attacks to the entire network and maintain these attacks as undetected. Finally, an event-triggered based detector is proposed that can be used to detect the quasi-covert cyber attacks.

Special classes of continuous games with infinite strategy spaces, such as polynomial games, can be solved by semidefinite programming. In general, however, continuous games are not directly amenable to computational procedures. In this contribution, we develop an iterative strategy generation technique for finding a Nash equilibrium in a whole class of continuous two-person zero-sum games with compact strategy sets. The procedure, which is called the double oracle algorithm, has been successfully applied to large finite games in the past. We prove the convergence of the double oracle algorithm to a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the algorithm is guaranteed to recover an approximate equilibrium in finitely-many steps. Our numerical experiments show that it outperforms fictitious play on several examples of games appearing in the literature. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of experiments with a version of the continuous Colonel Blotto game."

Due to a very low number of some predicate classes in the test sets, no reliable metrics can be retrieved for the rarest classes. We construct a new panoptic scene graph dataset and a set of metrics that are designed as a benchmark for the predictive performance especially on rare predicate classes. To construct the new dataset, we propose a model-assisted annotation pipeline that efficiently finds rare predicate classes that are hidden in a large set of images like needles in a haystack.   Contrary to prior scene graph datasets, Haystack contains explicit negative annotations, i.e. annotations that a given relation does not have a certain predicate class. Negative annotations are helpful especially in the field of scene graph generation and open up a whole new set of possibilities to improve current scene graph generation models.   Haystack is 100% compatible with existing panoptic scene graph datasets and can easily be integrated with existing evaluation pipelines.

However, it suffers from several drawbacks: 1) In reality, the underlying distributions are complicated and unknown, making it infeasible to be approximated by a simple distribution. 2) The correlation across dimensions of the input tensor is not well utilized, leading to sub-optimal performance. Although heuristics were proposed to incorporate such correlation as side information under Gaussian distribution, they can not easily be generalized to other distributions. Thus, a more principled way of utilizing the correlation in tensor factorization models is still an open challenge. Without assuming any explicit distribution, we formulate the tensor factorization as an optimal transport problem with Wasserstein distance, which can handle non-negative inputs.   We introduce SWIFT, which minimizes the Wasserstein distance that measures the distance between the input tensor and that of the reconstruction. In particular, we define the N-th order tensor Wasserstein loss for the widely used tensor CP factorization and derive the optimization algorithm that minimizes it. By leveraging sparsity structure and different equivalent formulations for optimizing computational efficiency, SWIFT is as scalable as other well-known CP algorithms. Using the factor matrices as features, SWIFT achieves up to 9.65% and 11.31% relative improvement over baselines for downstream prediction tasks. Under the noisy conditions, SWIFT achieves up to 15% and 17% relative improvements over the best competitors for the prediction tasks."

We address the full-bandit feedback, in which the agent observes only the sum of rewards, in contrast to the semi-bandit feedback, in which the agent observes also the individual arms' rewards. We present the Combinatorial Successive Accepts and Rejects (CSAR) algorithm, which generalizes SAR (Bubeck et al, 2013) for top-k combinatorial bandits. Our main contribution is an efficient sampling scheme that uses Hadamard matrices in order to estimate accurately the individual arms' expected rewards.

A fundamental challenge involves learning effective classifiers for such sequential data. While deep learning has led to impressive performance gains in recent years in domains such as speech, this has relied on the availability of large datasets of sequences with high-quality labels. In many applications, however, the associated class labels are often extremely limited, with precise labelling/segmentation being too expensive to perform at a high volume. However, large amounts of unlabeled data may still be available. In this paper we propose a novel framework for semi-supervised learning in such contexts. In an unsupervised manner, change point detection methods can be used to identify points within a sequence corresponding to likely class changes. We show that change points provide examples of similar/dissimilar pairs of sequences which, when coupled with labeled, can be used in a semi-supervised classification setting. Leveraging the change points and labeled data, we form examples of similar/dissimilar sequences to train a neural network to learn improved representations for classification. We provide extensive synthetic simulations and show that the learned representations are superior to those learned through an autoencoder and obtain improved results on both simulated and real-world human activity recognition datasets."

We extend Q-learning to solve Markov-Bandit games and show that our new Q-learning algorithms converge to the optimal solutions of the zero-sum Markov-Bandit games, and hence converge to the optimal solutions of the constrained and multi-objective Markov decision problems. We provide a numerical example where we calculate the optimal policies and show by simulations that the algorithm converges to the calculated optimal policies.

The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a standard procedure to generate bounds on paths resources in a general setting which covers most resource constrained shortest path problems, among which stochastic versions.   In that purpose, we introduce a generalization of the resource constrained shortest path problem where the resources are taken in a monoid. The resource of a path is the monoid sum of the resources of its arcs. The problem consists in finding a path whose resource minimizes a non-decreasing cost function of the path resource among the paths that respect a given constraint. Enumeration algorithms are generalized to this framework. We use lattice theory to provide polynomial procedures to find good quality bounds. These procedures solve a generalization of the algebraic path problem, where arc resources belong to a lattice ordered monoid. The practical efficiency of the approach is proved through an extensive numerical study on some deterministic and stochastic resource constrained shortest path problems."

While existing stereo vision systems make trade-offs between accuracy, performance and energy-efficiency, we describe ASV, an accelerated stereo vision system that simultaneously improves both performance and energy-efficiency while achieving high accuracy. The key to ASV is to exploit unique characteristics inherent to stereo vision, and apply stereo-specific optimizations, both algorithmically and computationally. We make two contributions. Firstly, we propose a new stereo algorithm, invariant-based stereo matching (ISM), that achieves significant speedup while retaining high accuracy. The algorithm combines classic ""hand-crafted"" stereo algorithms with recent developments in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), by leveraging the correspondence invariant unique to stereo vision systems. Secondly, we observe that the bottleneck of the ISM algorithm is the DNN inference, and in particular the deconvolution operations that introduce massive compute-inefficiencies. We propose a set of software optimizations that mitigate these inefficiencies. We show that with less than 0.5% hardware area overhead, these algorithmic and computational optimizations can be effectively integrated within a conventional DNN accelerator. Overall, ASV achieves 5x speedup and 85% energy saving with 0.02% accuracy loss compared to today DNN-based stereo vision systems."

The initial implementation assessed the local blood oxygenation saturation (SO 2), blood volume fraction (BVf) and vessel averaged radius (R) in humans and rodent brains using simple 2D representations of the vascular network during dictionary generation. In order to improve the results and possibly extend the approach to pathological environments and other biomarkers, we propose in this study to use 3D realistic vascular geometries in the numerical simulations. 28,000 different synthetic voxels containing vascular networks segmented from whole brain healthy mice microscopy images were created. A Bayesian-based regression model was used for map reconstruction. We show on 8 healthy and 9 tumor bearing rats that realistic vascular representations yield microvascular estimates in better agreement with the literature than 2D or 3D cylindrical models. Furthermore, tumoral blood oxygenation estimates obtained with the proposed approach are the only ones correlating with in vivo optic-fiber measurements performed in the same animals."
121,aaai,2021,Ontology-Enriched Query Answering on Relational Databases,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17789,"Query containment and query answering are two important computational tasks in databases. While query answering amounts to compute the result of a query over a database, query containment is the problem of checking whether for every database, the result of one query is a subset of the result of another query.   In this paper, we deal with unions of conjunctive queries, and we address query containment and query answering under Description Logic constraints. Every such constraint is essentially an inclusion dependencies between concepts and relations, and their expressive power is due to the possibility of using complex expressions, e.g., intersection and difference of relations, special forms of quantification, regular expressions over binary relations, in the specification of the dependencies. These types of constraints capture a great variety of data models, including the relational, the entity-relationship, and the object-oriented model, all extended with various forms of constraints, and also the basic features of the ontology languages used in the context of the Semantic Web.   We present the following results on both query containment and query answering. We provide a method for query containment under Description Logic constraints, thus showing that the problem is decidable, and analyze its computational complexity. We prove that query containment is undecidable in the case where we allow inequalities in the right-hand side query, even for very simple constraints and queries. We show that query answering under Description Logic constraints can be reduced to query containment, and illustrate how such a reduction provides upper bound results with respect to both combined and data complexity."
122,aaai,2021,Persistence of Anti-vaccine Sentiment in Social Networks Through Strategic Interactions,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16613,"We propose an equilibrium interaction model of occupational segregation and labor market inequality between two social groups, generated exclusively through the documented tendency to refer informal job seekers of identical ""social color"". The expected social color homophily in job referrals strategically induces distinct career choices for individuals from different social groups, which further translates into stable partial occupational segregation equilibria with sustained wage and employment inequality -- in line with observed patterns of racial or gender labor market disparities. Supporting the qualitative analysis with a calibration and simulation exercise, we furthermore show that both first and second best utilitarian social optima entail segregation, any integration policy requiring explicit distributional concerns. Our framework highlights that the mere social interaction through homophilous contact networks can be a pivotal channel for the propagation and persistence of gender and racial labor market gaps, complementary to long studied mechanisms such as taste or statistical discrimination."
123,aaai,2021,A Serverless Approach to Federated Learning Infrastructure Oriented for IoT/Edge Data Sources (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17870,"Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables the training of a shared global model across distributed clients while keeping the training data local. While most prior work on designing systems for FL has focused on using stateful always running components, recent work has shown that components in an FL system can greatly benefit from the usage of serverless computing and Function-as-a-Service technologies. To this end, distributed training of models with serverless FL systems can be more resource-efficient and cheaper than conventional FL systems. However, serverless FL systems still suffer from the presence of stragglers, i.e., slow clients due to their resource and statistical heterogeneity. While several strategies have been proposed for mitigating stragglers in FL, most methodologies do not account for the particular characteristics of serverless environments, i.e., cold-starts, performance variations, and the ephemeral stateless nature of the function instances. Towards this, we propose FedLesScan, a novel clustering-based semi-asynchronous training strategy, specifically tailored for serverless FL. FedLesScan dynamically adapts to the behaviour of clients and minimizes the effect of stragglers on the overall system. We implement our strategy by extending an open-source serverless FL system called FedLess. Moreover, we comprehensively evaluate our strategy using the 2nd generation Google Cloud Functions with four datasets and varying percentages of stragglers. Results from our experiments show that compared to other approaches FedLesScan reduces training time and cost by an average of 8% and 20% respectively while utilizing clients better with an average increase in the effective update ratio of 17.75%."
124,aaai,2021,Empirical Regularization for Synthetic Sentence Pairs in Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17479,"The overreliance on large parallel corpora significantly limits the applicability of machine translation systems to the majority of language pairs. Back-translation has been dominantly used in previous approaches for unsupervised neural machine translation, where pseudo sentence pairs are generated to train the models with a reconstruction loss. However, the pseudo sentences are usually of low quality as translation errors accumulate during training. To avoid this fundamental issue, we propose an alternative but more effective approach, extract-edit, to extract and then edit real sentences from the target monolingual corpora. Furthermore, we introduce a comparative translation loss to evaluate the translated target sentences and thus train the unsupervised translation systems. Experiments show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art unsupervised machine translation systems across two benchmarks (English-French and English-German) and two low-resource language pairs (English-Romanian and English-Russian) by more than 2 (up to 3.63) BLEU points."
125,aaai,2021,Learning Invariant Representations using Inverse Contrastive Loss,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16815,"Learning invariant representations is a critical first step in a number of machine learning tasks. A common approach corresponds to the so-called information bottleneck principle in which an application dependent function of mutual information is carefully chosen and optimized. Unfortunately, in practice, these functions are not suitable for optimization purposes since these losses are agnostic of the metric structure of the parameters of the model. We introduce a class of losses for learning representations that are invariant to some extraneous variable of interest by inverting the class of contrastive losses, i.e., inverse contrastive loss (ICL). We show that if the extraneous variable is binary, then optimizing ICL is equivalent to optimizing a regularized MMD divergence. More generally, we also show that if we are provided a metric on the sample space, our formulation of ICL can be decomposed into a sum of convex functions of the given distance metric. Our experimental results indicate that models obtained by optimizing ICL achieve significantly better invariance to the extraneous variable for a fixed desired level of accuracy. In a variety of experimental settings, we show applicability of ICL for learning invariant representations for both continuous and discrete extraneous variables."
126,aaai,2021,Learned Bi-Resolution Image Coding using Generalized Octave Convolutions,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16816,"In this proposal, we design a learned multi-frequency image compression approach that uses generalized octave convolutions to factorize the latent representations into high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components, and the LF components have lower resolution than HF components, which can improve the rate-distortion performance, similar to wavelet transform. Moreover, compared to the original octave convolution, the proposed generalized octave convolution (GoConv) and octave transposed-convolution (GoTConv) with internal activation layers preserve more spatial structure of the information, and enable more effective filtering between the HF and LF components, which further improve the performance. In addition, we develop a variable-rate scheme using the Lagrangian parameter to modulate all the internal feature maps in the auto-encoder, which allows the scheme to achieve the large bitrate range of the JPEG AI with only three models. Experiments show that the proposed scheme achieves much better Y MS-SSIM than VVC. In terms of YUV PSNR, our scheme is very similar to HEVC."
127,aaai,2021,Deep Bayesian Quadrature Policy Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16817,"We study the problem of obtaining accurate policy gradient estimates using a finite number of samples. Monte-Carlo methods have been the default choice for policy gradient estimation, despite suffering from high variance in the gradient estimates. On the other hand, more sample efficient alternatives like Bayesian quadrature methods have received little attention due to their high computational complexity. In this work, we propose deep Bayesian quadrature policy gradient (DBQPG), a computationally efficient high-dimensional generalization of Bayesian quadrature, for policy gradient estimation. We show that DBQPG can substitute Monte-Carlo estimation in policy gradient methods, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a set of continuous control benchmarks. In comparison to Monte-Carlo estimation, DBQPG provides (i) more accurate gradient estimates with a significantly lower variance, (ii) a consistent improvement in the sample complexity and average return for several deep policy gradient algorithms, and, (iii) the uncertainty in gradient estimation that can be incorporated to further improve the performance."
128,aaai,2021,Reward based Hebbian Learning in Direct Feedback Alignment (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17871,"Several recent studies attempt to address the biological implausibility of the well-known backpropagation (BP) method. While promising methods such as feedback alignment, direct feedback alignment, and their variants like sign-concordant feedback alignment tackle BP's weight transport problem, their validity remains controversial owing to a set of other unsolved issues. In this work, we answer the question of whether it is possible to realize random backpropagation solely based on mechanisms observed in neuroscience. We propose a hypothetical framework consisting of a new microcircuit architecture and its supporting Hebbian learning rules. Comprising three types of cells and two types of synaptic connectivity, the proposed microcircuit architecture computes and propagates error signals through local feedback connections and supports the training of multi-layered spiking neural networks with a globally defined spiking error function. We employ the Hebbian rule operating in local compartments to update synaptic weights and achieve supervised learning in a biologically plausible manner. Finally, we interpret the proposed framework from an optimization point of view and show its equivalence to sign-concordant feedback alignment. The proposed framework is benchmarked on several datasets including MNIST and CIFAR10, demonstrating promising BP-comparable accuracy."
129,aaai,2021,Argumentation Frameworks with Strong and Weak Constraints: Semantics and Complexity,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16768,"Recently, Strength-based Argumentation Frameworks (StrAFs) have been proposed to model situations where some quantitative strength is associated with arguments. In this setting, the notion of accrual corresponds to sets of arguments that collectively attack an argument. Some semantics have already been defined, which are sensitive to the existence of accruals that collectively defeat their target, while their individual elements cannot. However, until now, only the surface of this framework and semantics have been studied. Indeed, the existing literature focuses on the adaptation of the stable semantics to StrAFs. In this paper, we push forward the study and investigate the adaptation of admissibility-based semantics. Especially, we show that the strong admissibility defined in the literature does not satisfy a desirable property, namely Dung's fundamental lemma. We therefore propose an alternative definition that induces semantics that behave as expected. We then study computational issues for these new semantics, in particular we show that complexity of reasoning is similar to the complexity of the corresponding decision problems for standard argumentation frameworks in almost all cases. We then propose a translation in pseudo-Boolean constraints for computing (strong and weak) extensions. We conclude with an experimental evaluation of our approach which shows in particular that it scales up well for solving the problem of providing one extension as well as enumerating them all."
130,aaai,2021,New Length Dependent Algorithm for Maximum Satisfiability Problem,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16479,"Generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences are sequences that avoid a forbidden subsequence and have a sparsity requirement on their letters. Upper bounds on the lengths of generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences have been applied to a number of problems in discrete geometry and extremal combinatorics. Sharp bounds on the maximum lengths of generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences are known for some families of forbidden subsequences, but in general there are only rough bounds on the maximum lengths of most generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences. One method that was developed for finding upper bounds on the lengths of generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences uses a family of sequences called formations.   An $(r, s)$-formation is a concatenation of $s$ permutations of $r$ distinct letters. The formation width function $fw(u)$ is defined as the minimum $s$ for which there exists $r$ such that every $(r, s)$-formation contains $u$. The function $fw(u)$ has been used with upper bounds on extremal functions of $(r, s)$-formations to find tight bounds on the maximum possible lengths of many families of generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences. Algorithms have been found for computing $fw(u)$ for sequences $u$ of length $n$, but they have worst-case run time exponential in $n$, even for sequences $u$ with only three distinct letters.   We present an algorithm for computing $fw(u)$ with run time $O(n^{\alpha_r})$, where $r$ is the number of distinct letters in $u$ and $\alpha_r$ is a constant that only depends on $r$. We implement the new algorithm in Python and compare its run time to the next fastest algorithm for computing formation width. We also apply the new algorithm to find sharp upper bounds on the lengths of several families of generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences with $3$-letter forbidden patterns."

We propose a framework for bots to deploy probabilistic programming tools for interacting with intuitive physics environments. The framework employs a physics simulation in a probabilistic way to infer about moves performed by an agent in a setting governed by Newtonian laws of motion. However, methods of probabilistic programs can be slow in such setting due to their need to generate many samples. We complement the model with a model-free approach to aid the sampling procedures in becoming more efficient through learning from experience during game playing. We present an approach where combining model-free approaches (a convolutional neural network in our model) and model-based approaches (probabilistic physics simulation) is able to achieve what neither could alone. This way the model outperforms an all model-free or all model-based approach. We discuss a case study showing empirical results of the performance of the model on the game of Flappy Bird."

Knowing people's opinion is crucial for several purposes starting from gathering knowledge about customer base, e-governance, campaigning and many more. In this report, we aim to develop a system to detect the sentiment from tweets. We employ several linguistic features along with some other external sources of information to detect the sentiment of a tweet. We show that augmenting the 140 character-long tweet with information harvested from external urls shared in the tweet as well as Social Media features enhances the sentiment prediction accuracy significantly."

In many settings, only a set of selected alternatives during past interactions is available to the learner. Fargier et al. [2018] propose an approach to learn, in such a setting, a model of the users' preferences that ranks previously chosen alternatives as high as possible; and an algorithm to learn, in this setting, a particular model of preferences: lexicographic preferences trees (LP-trees). In this paper, we study complexity-theoretical problems related to this approach. We give an upper bound on the sample complexity of learning an LP-tree, which is logarithmic in the number of attributes. We also prove that computing the LP tree that minimises the empirical risk can be done in polynomial time when restricted to the class of linear LP-trees."

The primary hurdles to widening participation in and use of these new research tools are, first, a lack of coding skills in students across K-16, and in the population at large, and second, a lack of knowledge of how NLP-methods can be used to answer questions of disciplinary interest outside of linguistics and/or computer science. To broaden participation in NLP and improve NLP-literacy, we introduced a new tool web-based tool called Natural Language Processing 4 All (NLP4All). The intended purpose of NLP4All is to help teachers facilitate learning with and about NLP, by providing easy-to-use interfaces to NLP-methods, data, and analyses, making it possible for non- and novice-programmers to learn NLP concepts interactively."

However, different embedding sets vary greatly in quality and characteristics of the captured semantics. Instead of relying on a more advanced algorithm for embedding learning, this paper proposes an ensemble approach of combining different public embedding sets with the aim of learning meta-embeddings. Experiments on word similarity and analogy tasks and on part-of-speech tagging show better performance of meta-embeddings compared to individual embedding sets. One advantage of meta-embeddings is the increased vocabulary coverage. We will release our meta-embeddings publicly."

The most common symptoms include problems with communicating and abstract thinking, as well as disorientation. It is important to detect Alzheimer's disease in early stages so that cognitive functioning would be improved by medication and training. In this paper, we propose two attention model networks for detecting Alzheimer's disease from MRI images to help early detection efforts at the preclinical stage. We also compare the performance of these two attention network models with a baseline model. Recently available OASIS-3 Longitudinal Neuroimaging, Clinical, and Cognitive Dataset is used to train, evaluate and compare our models. The novelty of this research resides in the fact that we aim to detect Alzheimer's disease when all the parameters, physical assessments, and clinical data state that the patient is healthy and showing no symptoms"

However, prior studies observed improvements from explanations only when the AI, alone, outperformed both the human and the best team. Can explanations help lead to complementary performance, where team accuracy is higher than either the human or the AI working solo? We conduct mixed-method user studies on three datasets, where an AI with accuracy comparable to humans helps participants solve a task (explaining itself in some conditions). While we observed complementary improvements from AI augmentation, they were not increased by explanations. Rather, explanations increased the chance that humans will accept the AI's recommendation, regardless of its correctness. Our result poses new challenges for human-centered AI: Can we develop explanatory approaches that encourage appropriate trust in AI, and therefore help generate (or improve) complementary performance?"

The goal is to match every agent to a single item so as to maximize the social welfare. Most of the related literature, however, assumes that the values of the agents are not a priori known, and only access to the ordinal preferences of the agents over the items is provided. Consequently, this incomplete information leads to loss of efficiency, which is measured by the notion of distortion. In this paper, we further assume that the agents can answer a small number of queries, allowing us partial access to their values. We study the interplay between elicited cardinal information (measured by the number of queries per agent) and distortion for one-sided matching, as well as a wide range of well-studied related problems. Qualitatively, our results show that with a limited number of queries, it is possible to obtain significant improvements over the classic setting, where only access to ordinal information is given."

For this problem, we propose DLUCB: a fully decentralized algorithm that minimizes the cumulative regret over the entire network. At each round of the algorithm each agent chooses its actions following an upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy and agents share information with their immediate neighbors through a carefully designed consensus procedure that repeats over cycles. Our analysis adjusts the duration of these communication cycles ensuring near-optimal regret performance $\mathcal{O}(d\log{NT}\sqrt{NT})$ at a communication rate of $\mathcal{O}(dN^2)$ per round. The structure of the network affects the regret performance via a small additive term - coined the regret of delay - that depends on the spectral gap of the underlying graph. Notably, our results apply to arbitrary network topologies without a requirement for a dedicated agent acting as a server. In consideration of situations with high communication cost, we propose RC-DLUCB: a modification of DLUCB with rare communication among agents. The new algorithm trades off regret performance for a significantly reduced total communication cost of $\mathcal{O}(d^3N^{2.5})$ over all $T$ rounds. Finally, we show that our ideas extend naturally to the emerging, albeit more challenging, setting of safe bandits. For the recently studied problem of linear bandits with unknown linear safety constraints, we propose the first safe decentralized algorithm. Our study contributes towards applying bandit techniques in safety-critical distributed systems that repeatedly deal with unknown stochastic environments. We present numerical simulations for various network topologies that corroborate our theoretical findings."

The approach allows for conditional reasoning over arguments and boolean combination of arguments, with respect to a class of gradual semantics, through the verification of graded (strict or defeasible) implications over a preferential interpretation. As a proof of concept, in the finitely-valued case, an Answer set Programming approach is proposed for conditional reasoning in a many-valued argumentation semantics of weighted argumentation graphs. The paper also develops and discusses a probabilistic semantics for gradual argumentation, which builds on the many-valued conditional semantics."

Recently, deep learning has been leveraged to automatically generate layouts via image generation, showing a huge potential to free designers from laborious routines. While automatic generation can greatly boost productivity, designer input is undoubtedly crucial. An ideal AI-aided design tool should automate repetitive routines, and meanwhile accept human guidance and provide smart/proactive suggestions. However, the capability of involving humans into the loop has been largely ignored in existing methods which are mostly end-to-end approaches. To this end, we propose a new human-in-the-loop generative model, iPLAN, which is capable of automatically generating layouts, but also interacting with designers throughout the whole procedure, enabling humans and AI to co-evolve a sketchy idea gradually into the final design. iPLAN is evaluated on diverse datasets and compared with existing methods. The results show that iPLAN has high fidelity in producing similar layouts to those from human designers, great flexibility in accepting designer inputs and providing design suggestions accordingly, and strong generalizability when facing unseen design tasks and limited training data."

Using human-participant protocols, we evaluate our system against baseline systems with different commonsense reasoning reasoning and inductive biases to determine the role of soft causal relations in perceived story quality. Through these studies we also probe the interplay of how changes in commonsense norms across storytelling genres affect perceptions of story quality."

When summarizing reviews (e.g., for products or movies), such training data is neither available nor can be easily sourced, motivating the development of methods which rely on synthetic datasets for supervised training. We show that explicitly incorporating content planning in a summarization model not only yields output of higher quality, but also allows the creation of synthetic datasets which are more natural, resembling real world document-summary pairs. Our content plans take the form of aspect and sentiment distributions which we induce from data without access to expensive annotations. Synthetic datasets are created by sampling pseudo-reviews from a Dirichlet distribution parametrized by our content planner, while our model generates summaries based on input reviews and induced content plans. Experimental results on three domains show that our approach outperforms competitive models in generating informative, coherent, and fluent summaries that capture opinion consensus."

Unfortunately, annotation of multimodal data is challenging and expensive. Recently, self-supervised multimodal methods that combine vision and language were proposed to learn multimodal representations without annotation. However, these methods often choose to ignore the presence of high levels of noise and thus yield sub-optimal results. In this work, we show that the problem of noise estimation for multimodal data can be reduced to a multimodal density estimation task. Using multimodal density estimation, we propose a noise estimation building block for multimodal representation learning that is based strictly on the inherent correlation between different modalities. We demonstrate how our noise estimation can be broadly integrated and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art performance on five different benchmark datasets for two challenging multimodal tasks: Video Question Answering and Text-To-Video Retrieval. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical probabilistic error bound substantiating our empirical results and analyze failure cases. Code: https://github.com/elad-amrani/ssml."

In this paper, we redefine the task of scientific papers summarization by utilizing their citation graph and propose a citation graph-based summarization model CGSum which can incorporate the information of both the source paper and its references. In addition, we construct a novel scientific papers summarization dataset Semantic Scholar Network (SSN) which contains 141K research papers in different domains and 661K citation relationships. The entire dataset constitutes a large connected citation graph.

This paper introduces ADVISE, a new explainability method that quantifies and leverages the relevance of each unit of the feature map to provide better visual explanations. To this end, we propose using adaptive bandwidth kernel density estimation to assign a relevance score to each unit of the feature map with respect to the predicted class. We also propose an evaluation protocol to quantitatively assess the visual explainability of CNN models. We extensively evaluate our idea in the image classification task using AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception pretrained on ImageNet. We compare ADVISE with the state-of-the-art visual explainable methods and show that the proposed method outperforms competing approaches in quantifying feature-relevance and visual explainability while maintaining competitive time complexity. Our experiments further show that ADVISE fulfils the sensitivity and implementation independence axioms while passing the sanity checks. The implementation is accessible for reproducibility purposes on https://github.com/dehshibi/ADVISE."
149,aaai,2021,A Computational Approach to Sign Language Understanding,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17851,"Sign Languages are rich multi-channel languages, requiring articulation of both manual (hands) and non-manual (face and body) features in a precise, intricate manner. Sign Language Production (SLP), the automatic translation from spoken to sign languages, must embody this full sign morphology to be truly understandable by the Deaf community. Previous work has mainly focused on manual feature production, with an under-articulated output caused by regression to the mean.   In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Multi-Channel approach to SLP. We frame sign production as a minimax game between a transformer-based Generator and a conditional Discriminator. Our adversarial discriminator evaluates the realism of sign production conditioned on the source text, pushing the generator towards a realistic and articulate output. Additionally, we fully encapsulate sign articulators with the inclusion of non-manual features, producing facial features and mouthing patterns.   We evaluate on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) dataset, and report state-of-the art SLP back-translation performance for manual production. We set new benchmarks for the production of multi-channel sign to underpin future research into realistic SLP."

How can ambiguity be consciously designed in virtual worlds? What are the design principles for game designers? Ambiguity arises from discontinuity and decontextualization, from the deliberate omission of facts, and from the skillful superimposition of contradictory codes. An ontology of interactive media explains the elusive visual poetry and image perception. The five basic elements of media are presented. The model shows the key correlations of user, content, and technology in image perception. An overview of utopian representation as a cross-media phenomenon places game design in an interdisciplinary context. Six selected computer-generated illustrations show how the above design criteria can be successfully applied to the design of virtual worlds. The ambiguous utopia of an image exists only in a brief, irretrievable moment of our own perception. But this moment is valuable for designing real visions for a better future."

Some of the conflicts incur a foreseeable conflict in one or both of the children nodes when splitting on them. This paper introduces a new technique, namely the head-on technique that finds out such conflicts, so they can be processed more efficiently by resolving the conflict with the potential conflict all together in one split. The proposed technique applies to all CBS-based solvers. Experimental results show that the head-on technique improves the state-of-the-art MAPF solver CBSH."

The goal is to find a set of proxies that is $\theta$-representative, which entails that for any voter located anywhere on the line, its favorite candidate is within a distance $\theta$ of the favorite candidate of its closest proxy. This property guarantees a strong form of representation as the set of voters is not required to be fixed in advance, or even be finite. We show that for candidates located on a line, an optimal proxy arrangement can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, we provide upper and lower bounds on the number of proxies required to form a $\theta$-representative set, thus showing that a relatively small number of proxies is enough to capture the preferences of any set of voters. An additional beneficial property of a $\theta$-representative proxy arrangement is that for strict-Condorcet voting rules, the outcome of proxy voting is similarly close to the outcome of direct voting."
153,aaai,2021,Forming Better Stable Solutions in Group Formation Games Inspired by Internet Exchange Points (IXPs),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16644,"We study a coordination game motivated by the formation of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), in which agents choose which facilities to join. Joining the same facility as other agents you communicate with has benefits, but different facilities have different costs for each agent. Thus, the players wish to join the same facilities as their ""friends"", but this is balanced by them not wanting to pay the cost of joining a facility. We first show that the Price of Stability ($PoS$) of this game is at most 2, and more generally there always exists an $\alpha$-approximate equilibrium with cost at most $\frac{2}{\alpha}$ of optimum. We then focus on how better stable solutions can be formed. If we allow agents to pay their neighbors to prevent them from deviating (i.e., a player $i$ voluntarily pays another player $j$ so that $j$ joins the same facility), then we provide a payment scheme which stabilizes the solution with minimum social cost $s^*$, i.e. PoS is 1. In our main technical result, we consider how much a central coordinator would have to pay the players in order to form good stable solutions. Let $\Delta$ denote the total amount of payments needed to be paid to the players in order to stabilize $s^*$, i.e., these are payments that a player would lose if they changed their strategy from the one in $s^*$. We prove that there is a tradeoff between $\Delta$ and the Price of Stability: $\frac{\Delta}{cost(s^*)} \le 1 - \frac{2}{5} PoS$. Thus when there are no good stable solutions, only a small amount of extra payment is needed to stabilize $s^*$; and when good stable solutions already exist (i.e., $PoS$ is small), then we should be happy with those solutions instead. Finally, we consider the computational complexity of finding the optimum solution $s^*$, and design a polynomial time $O(\log n)$ approximation algorithm for this problem."
154,aaai,2021,Multi-Dimensional Explanation of Target Variables from Documents,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17483,"Automated predictions require explanations to be interpretable by humans. Past work used attention and rationale mechanisms to find words that predict the target variable of a document. Often though, they result in a tradeoff between noisy explanations or a drop in accuracy. Furthermore, rationale methods cannot capture the multi-faceted nature of justifications for multiple targets, because of the non-probabilistic nature of the mask. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Target Masker (MTM) to address these shortcomings. The novelty lies in the soft multi-dimensional mask that models a relevance probability distribution over the set of target variables to handle ambiguities. Additionally, two regularizers guide MTM to induce long, meaningful explanations. We evaluate MTM on two datasets and show, using standard metrics and human annotations, that the resulting masks are more accurate and coherent than those generated by the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, MTM is the first to also achieve the highest F1 scores for all the target variables simultaneously."

However, existing recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) are often constructed by random connections without optimization. While RSNNs can produce rich dynamics that are critical for memory formation and learning, systemic architectural optimization of RSNNs is still an open challenge. We aim to enable systematic design of large RSNNs via a new scalable RSNN architecture and automated architectural optimization. We compose RSNNs based on a layer architecture called Sparsely-Connected Recurrent Motif Layer (SC-ML) that consists of multiple small recurrent motifs wired together by sparse lateral connections. The small size of the motifs and sparse inter-motif connectivity leads to an RSNN architecture scalable to large network sizes. We further propose a method called Hybrid Risk-Mitigating Architectural Search (HRMAS) to systematically optimize the topology of the proposed recurrent motifs and SC-ML layer architecture. HRMAS is an alternating two-step optimization process by which we mitigate the risk of network instability and performance degradation caused by architectural change by introducing a novel biologically-inspired ""self-repairing"" mechanism through intrinsic plasticity. The intrinsic plasticity is introduced to the second step of each HRMAS iteration and acts as unsupervised fast self-adaptation to structural and synaptic weight modifications introduced by the first step during the RSNN architectural ""evolution"". To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that performs systematic architectural optimization of RSNNs. Using one speech and three neuromorphic datasets, we demonstrate the significant performance improvement brought by the proposed automated architecture optimization over existing manually-designed RSNNs."

Their success has enabled significant advances in conversational AI, including the development of open-dialogue systems capable of coherent, salient conversations which can answer questions, chat casually, and complete tasks. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle with tasks that involve higher levels of reasoning - including commonsense reasoning that humans find trivial. This paper presents a survey of recent conversational AI research focused on commonsense reasoning. The paper lists relevant training datasets and describes the primary approaches to include commonsense in conversational AI. The paper also discusses benchmarks used for evaluating commonsense in conversational AI problems. Finally, the paper presents preliminary observations of the limited commonsense capabilities of two state-of-the-art open dialogue models, BlenderBot3 and LaMDA, and its negative effect on natural interactions. These observations further motivate research on commonsense reasoning in conversational AI."

However, they are often closely interdependent, and both generally necessitate natural language understanding. Do they form a coherent abstract representation of documents? We present a neural network architecture for joint coreference resolution and semantic role labeling for English, and train graph neural networks to model the 'coherence' of the combined shallow semantic graph. Using the resulting coherence score as a reward for our joint semantic analyzer, we use reinforcement learning to encourage global coherence over the document and between semantic annotations. This leads to improvements on both tasks in multiple datasets from different domains, and across a range of encoders of different expressivity, calling, we believe, for a more holistic approach to semantics in NLP."

Lipschitz regularity is now established as a key property of modern deep learning with implications in training stability, generalization, robustness against adversarial examples, etc. However, computing the exact value of the Lipschitz constant of a neural network is known to be NP-hard. Recent attempts from the literature introduce upper bounds to approximate this constant that are either efficient but loose or accurate but computationally expensive. In this work, by leveraging the theory of Toeplitz matrices, we introduce a new upper bound for convolutional layers that is both tight and easy to compute. Based on this result we devise an algorithm to train Lipschitz regularized Convolutional Neural Networks."

A prime example of this is the influential SHAP-score, a version of the Shapley value that can help explain the result of a learned model on a specific entity by assigning a score to every feature. While in general computing Shapley values is a computationally intractable problem, it has recently been claimed that the SHAP-score can be computed in polynomial time over the class of decision trees. In this paper, we provide a proof of a stronger result over Boolean models: the SHAP-score can be computed in polynomial time over deterministic and decomposable Boolean circuits. Such circuits, also known as tractable Boolean circuits, generalize a wide range of Boolean circuits and binary decision diagrams classes, including binary decision trees, Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) and Free Binary Decision Diagrams (FBDDs). We also establish the computational limits of the notion of SHAP-score by observing that, under a mild condition, computing it over a class of Boolean models is always polynomially as hard as the model counting problem for that class. This implies that both determinism and decomposability are essential properties for the circuits that we consider, as removing one or the other renders the problem of computing the SHAP-score intractable (namely, #P-hard)."

We have witnessed the tremendous advancement of video frame interpolation, but the general video prediction in the wild is still an open question. Inspired by the photo-realistic results of video frame interpolation, we present a new optimization framework for video prediction via video frame interpolation, in which we solve an extrapolation problem based on an interpolation model. Our video prediction framework is based on optimization with a pretrained differentiable video frame interpolation module without the need for a training dataset, and thus there is no domain gap issue between training and test data. Also, our approach does not need any additional information such as semantic or instance maps, which makes our framework applicable to any video. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes, KITTI, DAVIS, Middlebury, and Vimeo90K datasets show that our video prediction results are robust in general scenarios, and our approach outperforms other video prediction methods that require a large amount of training data or extra semantic information."

To obtain the corresponding full image resolution,interpolation and variational approach are the most common options, which do not effectively improve the results. With the motivation of various convolutional neural network(CNN) structures succeeded in single image super-resolution(SISR) task, an end-to-end convolutional neural network is proposed to reconstruct the high resolution(HR) optical flow field from initial LR optical flow with the guidence of the first frame used in optical flow estimation. Our optical flow super-resolution(OFSR) problem differs from the general SISR problem in two main aspects. Firstly, the optical flow includes less texture information than image so that the SISR CNN structures can't be directly used in our OFSR problem. Secondly, the initial LR optical flow data contains estimation error, while the LR image data for SISR is generally a bicubic downsampled, blurred, and noisy version of HR ground truth. We evaluate the proposed approach on two different optical flow estimation mehods and show that it can not only obtain the full image resolution, but generate more accurate optical flow field (Accuracy improve 15% on FlyingChairs, 13% on MPI Sintel) with sharper edges than the estimation result of original method."

Recent studies show that neural-based models are effective in learning contextual representation for tabular data. The learning of an effective contextual representation requires meaningful features and a large amount of data. However, current methods often fail to properly learn a contextual representation from the features without semantic information. In addition, it's intractable to enlarge the training set through mixed tabular datasets due to the difference between datasets. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework PTab, using the Pre-trained language model to model Tabular data. PTab learns a contextual representation of tabular data through a three-stage processing: Modality Transformation(MT), Masked-Language Fine-tuning(MF), and Classification Fine-tuning(CF). We initialize our model with a pre-trained Model (PTM) which contains semantic information learned from the large-scale language data. Consequently, contextual representation can be learned effectively during the fine-tuning stages. In addition, we can naturally mix the textualized tabular data to enlarge the training set to further improve representation learning. We evaluate PTab on eight popular tabular classification datasets. Experimental results show that our method has achieved a better average AUC score in supervised settings compared to the state-of-the-art baselines(e.g. XGBoost), and outperforms counterpart methods under semi-supervised settings. We present visualization results that show PTab has well instance-based interpretability."
163,aaai,2021,Robust Model Compression Using Deep Hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16827,"Machine Learning models should ideally be compact and robust. Compactness provides efficiency and comprehensibility whereas robustness provides resilience. Both topics have been studied in recent years but in isolation. Here we present a robust model compression scheme which is independent of model types: it can compress ensembles, neural networks and other types of models into diverse types of small models. The main building block is the notion of depth derived from robust statistics. Originally, depth was introduced as a measure of the centrality of a point in a sample such that the median is the deepest point. This concept was extended to classification functions which makes it possible to define the depth of a hypothesis and the median hypothesis. Algorithms have been suggested to approximate the median but they have been limited to binary classification. In this study, we present a new algorithm, the Multiclass Empirical Median Optimization (MEMO) algorithm that finds a deep hypothesis in multi-class tasks, and prove its correctness. This leads to our Compact Robust Estimated Median Belief Optimization (CREMBO) algorithm for robust model compression. We demonstrate the success of this algorithm empirically by compressing neural networks and random forests into small decision trees, which are interpretable models, and show that they are more accurate and robust than other comparable methods. In addition, our empirical study shows that our method outperforms Knowledge Distillation on DNN to DNN compression."

However, free-text rationales' unconstrained nature makes them prone to hallucination, so it is important to have metrics for free-text rationale quality. Existing free-text rationale metrics measure how consistent the rationale is with the LM's predicted label, but there is no protocol for assessing such metrics' reliability. Thus, we propose FRAME, a framework for evaluating rationale-label consistency (RLC) metrics for free-text rationales. FRAME is based on three axioms: (1) good metrics should yield highest scores for reference rationales, which maximize RLC by construction; (2) good metrics should be appropriately sensitive to semantic perturbation of rationales; and (3) good metrics should be robust to variation in the LM's task performance. Across three text classification datasets, we show that existing RLC metrics cannot satisfy all three FRAME axioms, since they are implemented via model pretraining which muddles the metric's signal. Then, we introduce a non-pretraining RLC metric that greatly outperforms baselines on (1) and (3), while performing competitively on (2). Finally, we discuss the limitations of using RLC to evaluate free-text rationales."

The projective Beth definability property (PBDP) states that an explicit definition exists iff a formula stating implicit definability is valid. Thus, the CIP and PBDP reduce potentially hard existence problems to entailment in the underlying logic. Description (and modal) logics with nominals and/or role inclusions do not enjoy the CIP nor the PBDP, but interpolants and explicit definitions have many applications, in particular in concept learning, ontology engineering, and ontology-based data management. In this article we show that, even without Beth and Craig, the existence of interpolants and explicit definitions is decidable in description logics with nominals and/or role inclusions such as ALCO, ALCH and ALCHOI and corresponding hybrid modal logics. However, living without Beth and Craig makes this problem harder than entailment: the existence problems become 2ExpTime-complete in the presence of an ontology or the universal modality, and coNExpTime-complete otherwise. We also analyze explicit definition existence if all symbols (except the one that is defined) are admitted in the definition. In this case the complexity depends on whether one considers individual or concept names. Finally, we consider the problem of computing interpolants and explicit definitions if they exist and turn the complexity upper bound proof into an algorithm computing them, at least for description logics with role inclusions."

This operation is often challenging when the learned value function takes continuous actions as input. We introduce deep radial-basis value functions (RBVFs): value functions learned using a deep network with a radial-basis function (RBF) output layer. We show that the maximum action-value with respect to a deep RBVF can be approximated easily and accurately. Moreover, deep RBVFs can represent any true value function owing to their support for universal function approximation. We extend the standard DQN algorithm to continuous control by endowing the agent with a deep RBVF. We show that the resultant agent, called RBF-DQN, significantly outperforms value-function-only baselines, and is competitive with state-of-the-art actor-critic algorithms."

Our method, logic-guided genetic algorithm (LGGA), takes as input a set of labelled data points and auxiliary truths (ATs) (mathematical facts known a priori about the unknown function the regressor aims to learn) and outputs a specially generated and curated dataset that can be used with any SR method. Three key insights underpin our method: first, SR users often know simple ATs about the function they are trying to learn. Second, whenever an SR system produces a candidate equation inconsistent with these ATs, we can compute a counterexample to prove the inconsistency, and further, this counterexample may be used to augment the dataset and fed back to the SR system in a corrective feedback loop. Third, the value addition of these ATs is that their use in both the loss function and the data augmentation process leads to better rates of convergence, accuracy, and data efficiency. We evaluate LGGA against state-of-the-art SR tools, namely, Eureqa and TuringBot on 16 physics equations from ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"" book. We find that using these SR tools in conjunction with LGGA results in them solving up to 30.0% more equations, needing only a fraction of the amount of data compared to the same tool without LGGA, i.e., resulting in up to a 61.9% improvement in data efficiency."
168,aaai,2021,Efficient Poverty Mapping from High Resolution Remote Sensing Images,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16072,"In many developing nations, a lack of poverty data prevents critical humanitarian organizations from responding to large-scale crises. Currently, socioeconomic surveys are the only method implemented on a large scale for organizations and researchers to measure and track poverty. However, the inability to collect survey data efficiently and inexpensively leads to significant temporal gaps in poverty data; these gaps severely limit the ability of organizational entities to address poverty at its root cause. We propose a transfer learning model based on surface temperature change and remote sensing data to extract features useful for predicting poverty rates. Machine learning, supported by data sources of poverty indicators, has the potential to estimate poverty rates accurately and within strict time constraints. Higher temperatures, as a result of climate change, have caused numerous agricultural obstacles, socioeconomic issues, and environmental disruptions, trapping families in developing countries in cycles of poverty. To find patterns of poverty relating to temperature that have the highest influence on spatial poverty rates, we use remote sensing data. The two-step transfer model predicts the temperature delta from high resolution satellite imagery and then extracts image features useful for predicting poverty. The resulting model achieved 80% accuracy on temperature prediction. This method takes advantage of abundant satellite and temperature data to measure poverty in a manner comparable to the existing survey methods and exceeds similar models of poverty prediction."

We focus on valuations that have dichotomous marginals, in which the added value of any item to a set is either 0 or 1, and aim to design truthful allocation mechanisms (without money) that maximize welfare and are fair. For the case that players have submodular valuations with dichotomous marginals, we design such a deterministic truthful allocation mechanism. The allocation output by our mechanism is Lorenz dominating, and consequently satisfies many desired fairness properties, such as being envy-free up to any item (EFX), and maximizing the Nash Social Welfare (NSW). We then show that our mechanism with random priorities is envy-free ex-ante, while having all the above properties ex-post. Furthermore, we present several impossibility results precluding similar results for the larger class of XOS valuations.   To gauge the robustness of our positive results, we also study $\epsilon$-dichotomous valuations, in which the added value of any item to a set is either non-positive, or in the range $[1, 1 + \epsilon]$. We show several impossibility results in this setting, and also a positive result: for players that have additive $\epsilon$-dichotomous valuations with sufficiently small $\epsilon$, we design a randomized truthful mechanism with strong ex-post guarantees. For $\rho = \frac{1}{1 + \epsilon}$, the allocations that it produces generate at least a $\rho$-fraction of the maximum welfare, and enjoy $\rho$-approximations for various fairness properties, such as being envy-free up to one item (EF1), and giving each player at least her maximin share."
170,aaai,2021,Bayesian Persuasion under Ex Ante and Ex Post Constraints,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16648,"Bayesian persuasion is the study of information sharing policies among strategic agents. A prime example is signaling in online ad auctions: what information should a platform signal to an advertiser regarding a user when selling the opportunity to advertise to her? Practical considerations such as preventing discrimination, protecting privacy or acknowledging limited attention of the information receiver impose constraints on information sharing. In this work, we propose and analyze a simple way to mathematically model such constraints as restrictions on Receiver's admissible posterior beliefs.   We consider two families of constraints - ex ante and ex post, where the latter limits each instance of Sender-Receiver communication, while the former more general family can also pose restrictions in expectation. For the ex ante family, Doval and Skreta establish the existence of an optimal signaling scheme with a small number of signals - at most the number of constraints plus the number of states of nature; we show this result is tight and provide an alternative proof for it. For the ex post family, we tighten a bound of V{\o}lund, showing that the required number of signals is at most the number of states of nature, as in the original Kamenica-Gentzkow setting. As our main algorithmic result, we provide an additive bi-criteria FPTAS for an optimal constrained signaling scheme assuming a constant number of states; we improve the approximation to single-criteria under a Slater-like regularity condition. The FPTAS holds under standard assumptions; relaxed assumptions yield a PTAS. Finally, we bound the ratio between Sender's optimal utility under convex ex ante constraints and the corresponding ex post constraints. This bound applies to finding an approximately welfare-maximizing constrained signaling scheme in ad auctions."

However, previous works based on dense undirected interaction suffer from modeling superfluous interactions and neglect of trajectory motion tendency, and thus inevitably result in a considerable deviance from the reality. To cope with these issues, we present a Sparse Graph Convolution Network~(SGCN) for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Specifically, the SGCN explicitly models the sparse directed interaction with a sparse directed spatial graph to capture adaptive interaction pedestrians. Meanwhile, we use a sparse directed temporal graph to model the motion tendency, thus to facilitate the prediction based on the observed direction. Finally, parameters of a bi-Gaussian distribution for trajectory prediction are estimated by fusing the above two sparse graphs. We evaluate our proposed method on the ETH and UCY datasets, and the experimental results show our method outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods by 9% in Average Displacement Error(ADE) and 13% in Final Displacement Error(FDE). Notably, visualizations indicate that our method can capture adaptive interactions between pedestrians and their effective motion tendencies."
172,aaai,2021,Defending against Contagious Attacks on a Network with Resource Reallocation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16649,"In classic network security games, the defender distributes defending resources to the nodes of the network, and the attacker attacks a node, with the objective to maximize the damage caused. Existing models assume that the attack at node u causes damage only at u. However, in many real-world security scenarios, the attack at a node u spreads to the neighbors of u and can cause damage at multiple nodes, e.g., for the outbreak of a virus. In this paper, we consider the network defending problem against contagious attacks.   Existing works that study shared resources assume that the resource allocated to a node can be shared or duplicated between neighboring nodes. However, in real world, sharing resource naturally leads to a decrease in defending power of the source node, especially when defending against contagious attacks. To this end, we study the model in which resources allocated to a node can only be transferred to its neighboring nodes, which we refer to as a reallocation process.   We show that this more general model is difficult in two aspects: (1) even for a fixed allocation of resources, we show that computing the optimal reallocation is NP-hard; (2) for the case when reallocation is not allowed, we show that computing the optimal allocation (against contagious attack) is also NP-hard. For positive results, we give a mixed integer linear program formulation for the problem and a bi-criteria approximation algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that the allocation and reallocation strategies our algorithm computes perform well in terms of minimizing the damage due to contagious attacks."
173,aaai,2021,DecAug: Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Decomposed Feature Representation and Semantic Augmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16829,"While deep learning demonstrates its strong ability to handle independent and identically distributed (IID) data, it often suffers from out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization, where the test data come from another distribution (w.r.t. the training one). Designing a general OoD generalization framework to a wide range of applications is challenging, mainly due to possible correlation shift and diversity shift in the real world. Most of the previous approaches can only solve one specific distribution shift, such as shift across domains or the extrapolation of correlation. To address that, we propose DecAug, a novel decomposed feature representation and semantic augmentation approach for OoD generalization. DecAug disentangles the category-related and context-related features. Category-related features contain causal information of the target object, while context-related features describe the attributes, styles, backgrounds, or scenes, causing distribution shifts between training and test data. The decomposition is achieved by orthogonalizing the two gradients (w.r.t. intermediate features) of losses for predicting category and context labels. Furthermore, we perform gradient-based augmentation on context-related features to improve the robustness of the learned representations. Experimental results show that DecAug outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on various OoD datasets, which is among the very few methods that can deal with different types of OoD generalization challenges."

While language models have proven transformational for the natural language processing community, these models have proven expensive, energy-intensive, and challenging to train. In this work, we explore the effect of curriculum learning on language model pretraining using various linguistically motivated curricula and evaluate transfer performance on the GLUE Benchmark. Despite a broad variety of training methodologies and experiments we do not find compelling evidence that curriculum learning methods improve language model training."
175,aaai,2021,Correlative Channel-Aware Fusion for Multi-View Time Series Classification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16830,"Multi-view time series classification (MVTSC) aims to improve the performance by fusing the distinctive temporal information from multiple views. Existing methods mainly focus on fusing multi-view information at an early stage, e.g., by learning a common feature subspace among multiple views. However, these early fusion methods may not fully exploit the unique temporal patterns of each view in complicated time series. Moreover, the label correlations of multiple views, which are critical to boost-ing, are usually under-explored for the MVTSC problem. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Correlative Channel-Aware Fusion (C2AF) network. First, C2AF extracts comprehensive and robust temporal patterns by a two-stream structured encoder for each view, and captures the intra-view and inter-view label correlations with a graph-based correlation matrix. Second, a channel-aware learnable fusion mechanism is implemented through convolutional neural networks to further explore the global correlative patterns. These two steps are trained end-to-end in the proposed C2AF network. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods. A detailed ablation study is also provided to show the effectiveness of each model component."

This challenge can be separated into three subtasks, (1) knowledge-seeking turn detection, (2) knowledge selection, and (3) knowledge-grounded response generation. We use pre-trained language models, ELECTRA and RoBERTa, as our base encoder for different subtasks. For subtask 1 and 2, the coarse-grained information like domain and entity are used to enhance knowledge usage. For subtask 3, we use a latent variable to encode dialog history and selected knowledge better and generate responses combined with copy mechanism. Meanwhile, some useful post-processing strategies are performed on the model's final output to make further knowledge usage in the generation task. As shown in released evaluation results, our proposed system ranks second under objective metrics and ranks fourth under human metrics."

The indivisibility of the goods is long known to pose highly non-trivial obstacles to achieving fairness, and a very vibrant line of research has aimed to circumvent them using appropriate notions of approximate fairness. Recent work has established that even approximate versions of proportionality (PROPx) may be impossible to achieve even for small instances, while the best known achievable approximations (PROP1) are much weaker. We introduce the notion of proportionality up to the maximin item (PROPm) and show how to reach an allocation satisfying this notion for any instance involving up to five agents with additive valuations. PROPm provides a well-motivated middle-ground between PROP1 and PROPx, while also capturing some elements of the well-studied maximin share (MMS) benchmark: another relaxation of proportionality that has attracted a lot of attention."

Cancer drugs ideally kill cancer cells while limiting harm to healthy cells. However, the inherent variance among cells in both cancer and healthy cell populations increases the difficulty of selective drug action. Here we propose a classification framework based on the idea that an ideal cancer drug should maximally discriminate between cancer and healthy cells. We first explore how molecular markers can be used to discriminate cancer cells from healthy cells on a single cell basis, and then how the effects of drugs are statistically predicted by these molecular markers. We then combine these two ideas to show how to optimally match drugs to tumor cells. We find that expression levels of a handful of genes suffice to discriminate well between individual cells in cancer and healthy tissue. We also find that gene expression predicts the efficacy of cancer drugs, suggesting that the cancer drugs act as classifiers using gene profiles. In agreement with our first finding, a small number of genes predict drug efficacy well. Finally, we formulate a framework that defines an optimal drug, and predicts drug cocktails that may target cancer more accurately than the individual drugs alone. Conceptualizing cancer drugs as solving a discrimination problem in the high-dimensional space of molecular markers promises to inform the design of new cancer drugs and drug cocktails."

However, the usability of those tools remains moderate due to the problems in understanding rich language variations in human commands, along with efficiency and comprehensibility issues. Therefore, we introduce Voicify, an Android virtual assistant that allows users to interact with on-screen elements in mobile apps through voice commands. Using a novel deep learning command parser, Voicify interprets human verbal input and performs matching with UI elements. In addition, the tool can directly open a specific feature from installed applications by fetching application code information to explore the set of in-app components. Our command parser achieved 90\% accuracy on the human command dataset. Furthermore, the direct feature invocation module achieves better feature coverage in comparison to Google Assistant. The user study demonstrates the usefulness of Voicify in real-world scenarios."
182,aaai,2021,Deterministic Mini-batch Sequencing for Training Deep Neural Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16831,"Deep learning with noisy labels is practically challenging, as the capacity of deep models is so high that they can totally memorize these noisy labels sooner or later during training. Nonetheless, recent studies on the memorization effects of deep neural networks show that they would first memorize training data of clean labels and then those of noisy labels. Therefore in this paper, we propose a new deep learning paradigm called Co-teaching for combating with noisy labels. Namely, we train two deep neural networks simultaneously, and let them teach each other given every mini-batch: firstly, each network feeds forward all data and selects some data of possibly clean labels; secondly, two networks communicate with each other what data in this mini-batch should be used for training; finally, each network back propagates the data selected by its peer network and updates itself. Empirical results on noisy versions of MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that Co-teaching is much superior to the state-of-the-art methods in the robustness of trained deep models."
183,aaai,2021,Attr2Style: A Transfer Learning Approach for Inferring Fashion Styles via Apparel Attributes,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17790,"Popular fashion e-commerce platforms mostly provide details about low-level attributes of an apparel (eg, neck type, dress length, collar type) on their product detail pages. However, customers usually prefer to buy apparel based on their style information, or simply put, occasion (eg, party/ sports/ casual wear). Application of a supervised image-captioning model to generate style-based image captions is limited because obtaining ground-truth annotations in the form of style-based captions is difficult. This is because annotating style-based captions requires a certain amount of fashion domain expertise, and also adds to the costs and manual effort. On the contrary, low-level attribute based annotations are much more easily available. To address this issue, we propose a transfer-learning based image captioning model that is trained on a source dataset with sufficient attribute-based ground-truth captions, and used to predict style-based captions on a target dataset. The target dataset has only a limited amount of images with style-based ground-truth captions. The main motivation of our approach comes from the fact that most often there are correlations among the low-level attributes and the higher-level styles for an apparel. We leverage this fact and train our model in an encoder-decoder based framework using attention mechanism. In particular, the encoder of the model is first trained on the source dataset to obtain latent representations capturing the low-level attributes. The trained model is fine-tuned to generate style-based captions for the target dataset. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the captions generated by our approach are close to the actual style information for the evaluated apparel. A Proof Of Concept for our model is under pilot at Myntra where it is exposed to some internal users for feedback."

Briefness and comprehensiveness are necessary in order to provide a large amount of information concisely when explaining a black-box decision system. However, existing interpretable machine learning methods fail to consider briefness and comprehensiveness simultaneously, leading to redundant explanations. We propose the variational information bottleneck for interpretation, VIBI, a system-agnostic interpretable method that provides a brief but comprehensive explanation. VIBI adopts an information theoretic principle, information bottleneck principle, as a criterion for finding such explanations. For each instance, VIBI selects key features that are maximally compressed about an input (briefness), and informative about a decision made by a black-box system on that input (comprehensive). We evaluate VIBI on three datasets and compare with state-of-the-art interpretable machine learning methods in terms of both interpretability and fidelity evaluated by human and quantitative metrics"

Lack of vaccine and therapeutic has rendered social exclusion through lockdown as the singular mode of containment. Harnessing the predictive powers of Machine Learning within a 6 dimensional infection kinetic model, depicting interactive evolution of 6 infection stages - healthy susceptible ($H$), predisposed comorbid susceptible ($P$), infected ($I$), recovered ($R$), herd immunized ($V$) and mortality ($D$) - the model, PHIRVD, provides the first accurate mortality prediction of 18 countries at varying stages of strategic lockdown, up to 30 days beyond last data training. PHIRVD establishes mortality-to-infection ratio as the correct pandemic descriptor, substituting reproduction number, and highlights the importance of early and prolonged but strategic lockdown to contain secondary relapse.   Significance Statement:   1. Accurate prediction of the day-by-day mortality profiles of 18 countries, 30 days beyond the last data of data training.   2. Precise quantification of the impact of early-vs-later lockdown impositions.   3. Accurate prediction of secondary relapse timelines/   4. Establishment of mortality-to-infected ratio as the correct pandemic descriptor substituting the popular choice of reproduction number, a proven failure in predicting future infection kinetics and secondary surge.   The outcomes have potential to redefine healthy policy landscape, particularly in light of secondary relapse and possible future SARS-COV/Ebola group incursion."
186,aaai,2021,Is the Most Accurate AI the Best Teammate? Optimizing AI for Teamwork,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17359,"AI practitioners typically strive to develop the most accurate systems, making an implicit assumption that the AI system will function autonomously. However, in practice, AI systems often are used to provide advice to people in domains ranging from criminal justice and finance to healthcare. In such AI-advised decision making, humans and machines form a team, where the human is responsible for making final decisions. But is the most accurate AI the best teammate? We argue ""No"" -- predictable performance may be worth a slight sacrifice in AI accuracy. Instead, we argue that AI systems should be trained in a human-centered manner, directly optimized for team performance. We study this proposal for a specific type of human-AI teaming, where the human overseer chooses to either accept the AI recommendation or solve the task themselves. To optimize the team performance for this setting we maximize the team's expected utility, expressed in terms of the quality of the final decision, cost of verifying, and individual accuracies of people and machines. Our experiments with linear and non-linear models on real-world, high-stakes datasets show that the most accuracy AI may not lead to highest team performance and show the benefit of modeling teamwork during training through improvements in expected team utility across datasets, considering parameters such as human skill and the cost of mistakes. We discuss the shortcoming of current optimization approaches beyond well-studied loss functions such as log-loss, and encourage future work on AI optimization problems motivated by human-AI collaboration."

Existing work shows that abstractive rewriting for extractive summaries can improve the conciseness and readability. These rewriting systems consider extracted summaries as the only input, which is relatively focused but can lose important background knowledge. In this paper, we investigate contextualized rewriting, which ingests the entire original document. We formalize contextualized rewriting as a seq2seq problem with group alignments, introducing group tag as a solution to model the alignments, identifying extracted summaries through content-based addressing. Results show that our approach significantly outperforms non-contextualized rewriting systems without requiring reinforcement learning, achieving strong improvements on ROUGE scores upon multiple extractive summarizers."
188,aaai,2021,Dense Events Grounding in Video,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16175,"Joint video-language learning has received increasing attention in recent years. However, existing works mainly focus on single or multiple trimmed video clips (events), which makes human-annotated event boundaries necessary during inference. To break away from the ties, we propose a grounded vision-language learning framework for untrimmed videos, which automatically detects informative events and effectively excavates the alignments between multi-sentence descriptions and corresponding event segments. Instead of coarse-level video-language alignments, we present two dual pretext tasks to encourage fine-grained segment-level alignments, i.e., text-to-event grounding (TEG) and event-to-text generation (ETG). TEG learns to adaptively ground the possible event proposals given a set of sentences by estimating the cross-modal distance in a joint semantic space. Meanwhile, ETG aims to reconstruct (generate) the matched texts given event proposals, encouraging the event representation to retain meaningful semantic information. To encourage accurate label assignment between the event set and the text set, we propose a novel semantic-aware cost to mitigate the sub-optimal matching results caused by ambiguous boundary annotations. Our framework is easily extensible to tasks covering visually-grounded language understanding and generation. We achieve state-of-the-art dense video captioning performance on ActivityNet Captions, YouCook2 and YouMakeup, and competitive performance on several other language generation and understanding tasks. Our method also achieved 1st place in both the MTVG and MDVC tasks of the PIC 4th Challenge. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zjr2000/GVL."

Sampling-based approaches, like rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) or probabilistic roadmaps, are prominent algorithmic solutions for path planning problems. Despite its exponential convergence rate, RRT can only find suboptimal paths. On the other hand, $\textrm{RRT}^*$, a widely-used extension to RRT, guarantees probabilistic completeness for finding optimal paths but suffers in practice from slow convergence in complex environments. Furthermore, real-world robotic environments are often partially observable or with poorly described dynamics, casting the application of $\textrm{RRT}^*$ in complex tasks suboptimal. This paper studies a novel algorithmic formulation of the popular Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm for robot path planning. Notably, we study Monte-Carlo Path Planning (MCPP) by analyzing and proving, on the one part, its exponential convergence rate to the optimal path in fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), and on the other part, its probabilistic completeness for finding feasible paths in partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) assuming limited distance observability (proof sketch). Our algorithmic contribution allows us to employ recently proposed variants of MCTS with different exploration strategies for robot path planning. Our experimental evaluations in simulated 2D and 3D environments with a 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulator, as well as in a real-world robot path planning task, demonstrate the superiority of MCPP in POMDP tasks."

For contemporary massive data sets, RAM-based algorithms become impractical. And although there exist good sequential algorithms for k-center, they are not easily parallelizable.   In this paper, we design and implement parallel approximation algorithms for this problem. We observe that Gonzalez's greedy algorithm can be efficiently parallelized in several MapReduce rounds; in practice, we find that two rounds are sufficient, leading to a 4-approximation. We contrast this with an existing parallel algorithm for k-center that runs in a constant number of rounds, and offers a 10-approximation. In depth runtime analysis reveals that this scheme is often slow, and that its sampling procedure only runs if k is sufficiently small, relative to the input size. To trade off runtime for approximation guarantee, we parameterize this sampling algorithm, and find in our experiments that the algorithm is not only faster, but sometimes more effective. Yet the parallel version of Gonzalez is about 100 times faster than both its sequential version and the parallel sampling algorithm, barely compromising solution quality."

Existing skill learning methods use mutual information objectives to incentivize each skill to be diverse and distinguishable from the rest. However, if care is not taken to constrain the ways in which the skills are diverse, trivially diverse skill sets can arise. To ensure useful skill diversity, we propose a novel skill learning objective, Relative Variational Intrinsic Control (RVIC), which incentivizes learning skills that are distinguishable in how they change the agent's relationship to its environment. The resulting set of skills tiles the space of affordances available to the agent. We qualitatively analyze skill behaviors on multiple environments and show how RVIC skills are more useful than skills discovered by existing methods when used in hierarchical reinforcement learning."

While previously the attention was mostly on efficiency, more recently fairness issues have been taken into account in this scope. In this paper, we propose to use randomization as a mean for achieving fairness. Similar to previous works like Fish et al. (WWW '19) and Tsang et al. (IJCAI '19), we study the maximin criterion for (group) fairness. In contrast to their work however, we model the problem in such a way that, when choosing the seed sets, probabilistic strategies are possible rather than only deterministic ones. We introduce two different variants of this probabilistic problem, one that entails probabilistic strategies over nodes (node-based problem) and a second one that entails probabilistic strategies over sets of nodes (set-based problem). While the original deterministic problem involving the maximin criterion has been shown to be inapproximable, interestingly, we show that both probabilistic variants permit approximation algorithms that achieve a constant multiplicative factor of 1-1/e plus an additive arbitrarily small error that is due to the simulation of the information spread. For an experimental study, we provide implementations of multiplicative-weight routines for both problems and compare the achieved fairness values to existing methods. Maybe non-surprisingly, we show that the ex-ante values of the computed probabilistic strategies are significantly larger than the (ex-post) fairness values of previous methods. This indicates that studying fairness via randomization is a worthwhile path to follow. Interestingly and maybe more surprisingly, we observe that even the ex-post fairness values computed by our routines, dominate over the fairness achieved by previous methods on most of the instances tested."

Quantum correlations violating Bell inequalities defy satisfactory causal explanations within the framework of classical causal models. What is more, a theory encompassing quantum systems and gravity is expected to allow causally nonseparable processes featuring operations in indefinite causal order, defying that events be causally ordered at all. The first challenge has been addressed through the recent development of intrinsically quantum causal models, allowing causal explanations of quantum processes -- provided they admit a definite causal order, i.e. have an acyclic causal structure. This work addresses causally nonseparable processes and offers a causal perspective on them through extending quantum causal models to cyclic causal structures. Among other applications of the approach, it is shown that all unitarily extendible bipartite processes are causally separable and that for unitary processes, causal nonseparability and cyclicity of their causal structure are equivalent."

This paper contributes to that analysis in two ways. First, I show that our definition is in fact a formalization of Wright's famous NESS definition of causation combined with a counterfactual difference-making condition. This means that our definition integrates two highly influential approaches to causation that are claimed to stand in opposition to each other. Second, I modify our definition to offer a substantial improvement: I weaken the difference-making condition in such a way that it avoids the problematic analysis of cases of preemption. The resulting Counterfactual NESS definition of causation forms a natural compromise between counterfactual approaches and the NESS approach."

However, these parts often exhibit dramatic visual variations such as occlusions, viewpoints, and spatial transformations, making it hard to detect. In this paper, we present a novel attention-based model to automatically, selectively and accurately focus on critical object regions with higher importance against appearance variations. Given an image, two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are constructed, where the outputs of two CNNs are correlated through bilinear pooling to simultaneously focus on discriminative regions and extract relevant features. To capture spatial distributions among the local regions with visual attention, soft attention based spatial Long-Short Term Memory units (LSTMs) are incorporated to realize spatially recurrent yet visually selective over local input patterns. All the above intuitions equip our network with the following novel model: two-stream CNN layers, bilinear pooling layer, spatial recurrent layer with location attention are jointly trained via an end-to-end fashion to serve as the part detector and feature extractor, whereby relevant features are localized and extracted attentively. We show the significance of our network against two well-known visual recognition tasks: fine-grained image classification and person re-identification."

The outcome of our work is a language for specifyin user preferences, tailored to HTN planning, together with a provably optimal preference-based planner, HTNPLAN, that is implemented as an extension of SHOP2. To compute preferred plans, we propose an approach based on forward-chaining heuristic search. Our heuristic uses an admissible evaluation function measuring the satisfaction of preferences over partial plans. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our HTNPLAN heuristics. We prove our approach sound and optimal with respect to the plans it generates by appealing to a situation calculus semantics of our preference language and of HTN planning. While our implementation builds on SHOP2, the language and techniques proposed here are relevant to a broad range of HTN planners."

This setting requires a careful balance between the fairness considerations and the rights of the present owners.   The paper presents re-division algorithms that attain various trade-off points between fairness and ownership rights, in various settings differing in the geometric constraints on the allotments: (a) no geometric constraints; (b) connectivity -- the cake is a one-dimensional interval and each piece must be a contiguous interval; (c) rectangularity -- the cake is a two-dimensional rectangle or rectilinear polygon and the pieces should be rectangles; (d) convexity -- the cake is a two-dimensional convex polygon and the pieces should be convex.   These re-division algorithms have implications on another problem: the price-of-fairness -- the loss of social welfare caused by fairness requirements. Each algorithm implies an upper bound on the price-of-fairness with the respective geometric constraints."

With only indivisible goods, a full MMS allocation may not exist, but a constant multiplicative approximate allocation always does. We analyze how the MMS approximation guarantee would be affected when the resources to be allocated also contain divisible goods. In particular, we show that the worst-case MMS approximation guarantee with mixed goods is no worse than that with only indivisible goods. However, there exist problem instances to which adding some divisible resources would strictly decrease the MMS approximation ratio of the instance. On the algorithmic front, we propose a constructive algorithm that will always produce an $\alpha$-MMS allocation for any number of agents, where $\alpha$ takes values between $1/2$ and $1$ and is a monotone increasing function determined by how agents value the divisible goods relative to their MMS values."

Work on the subject typically assumes that the cake is represented by an interval. In this paper, we introduce a generalized setting where the cake can be in the form of the set of edges of an undirected graph. This allows us to model the division of road or cable networks. Unlike in the canonical setting, common fairness criteria such as proportionality cannot always be satisfied in our setting if each agent must receive a connected subgraph. We determine the optimal approximation of proportionality that can be obtained for any number of agents with arbitrary valuations, and exhibit tight guarantees for each graph in the case of two agents. In addition, when more than one connected piece per agent is allowed, we establish the best egalitarian welfare guarantee for each total number of connected pieces. We also study a number of variants and extensions, including when approximate equitability is considered, or when the item to be divided is undesirable (also known as chore division)."

We articulate this new agenda for AI fairness for people with disabilities, explaining how combining data protection and equality law creates new opportunities for disabled people's organisations and assistive technology researchers alike to shape the use of AI, as well as to challenge potential harmful uses."
202,aaai,2021,Combining Preference Elicitation with Local Search and Greedy Search for Matroid Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17452,"We present a simple combinatorial $\frac{1 -e^{-2}}{2}$-approximation algorithm for maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a knapsack and a matroid constraint.   This classic problem is known to be hard to approximate within factor better than $1 - 1/e$. We show that the algorithm can be extended to yield a ratio of $\frac{1 - e^{-(k+1)}}{k+1}$ for the problem with a single knapsack and the intersection of $k$ matroid constraints, for any fixed $k > 1$.   Our algorithms, which combine the greedy algorithm of [Khuller, Moss and Naor, 1999] and [Sviridenko, 2004] with local search, show the power of this natural framework in submodular maximization with combined constraints."

A condition is called chain-dependent, if it is satisfied for a family if and only if it is satisfied for its intersections with the $n!$ full chains. We introduce a method to handle problems with such conditions, then show how it can be used to prove three classic theorems. Then, a theorem about families containing no two sets such that $A\subset B$ and $\lambda \cdot |A| \le |B|$ is proved. Finally, we investigate problems where instead of the size of the family, the number of $\ell$-chains is maximized. Our method is to define a weight function on the sets (or $\ell$-chains) and use it in a double counting argument involving full chains."

Roughly speaking, the problem deals with minimizing the makespan when scheduling jobs that consume non-renewable resources. We focus on the single-machine case without preemption: from time to time, the resources of the machine are (partially) replenished, thus allowing for meeting a necessary pre-condition for processing further jobs, each of which having individual resource demands. We initiate a systematic exploration of the parameterized (exact) complexity landscape of the problem, providing parameterized tractability as well as intractability results. Doing so, we mainly investigate how parameters related to the resource supplies influence the computational solvability. Thereby, we get a deepened understanding of the algorithmic complexity of this fundamental scheduling problem."

This, however, remains a challenging task, particularly for extremely small vessels that are difficult to visualize. We propose to leverage the rich spatiotemporal context available in ultrasound to improve segmentation of small-scale lower-extremity arterial vasculature. We describe efficient deep learning methods that incorporate temporal, spatial, and feature-aware contextual embeddings at multiple resolution scales while jointly utilizing information from B-mode and Color Doppler signals. Evaluating on femoral and tibial artery scans performed on healthy subjects by an expert ultrasonographer, and comparing to consensus expert ground-truth annotations of inner lumen boundaries, we demonstrate real-time segmentation using the context-aware models and show that they significantly outperform comparable baseline approaches."

As a novel AI system, ChatGPT claims to be proficient in such translation tasks and in this paper, we put that claim to the test. Specifically, we examine ChatGPT's accuracy in translating between English and languages that exclusively use gender-neutral pronouns. We center this study around Bengali, the 7$^{th}$ most spoken language globally, but also generalize our findings across five other languages: Farsi, Malay, Tagalog, Thai, and Turkish. We find that ChatGPT perpetuates gender defaults and stereotypes assigned to certain occupations (e.g. man = doctor, woman = nurse) or actions (e.g. woman = cook, man = go to work), as it converts gender-neutral pronouns in languages to `he' or `she'. We also observe ChatGPT completely failing to translate the English gender-neutral pronoun `they' into equivalent gender-neutral pronouns in other languages, as it produces translations that are incoherent and incorrect. While it does respect and provide appropriately gender-marked versions of Bengali words when prompted with gender information in English, ChatGPT appears to confer a higher respect to men than to women in the same occupation. We conclude that ChatGPT exhibits the same gender biases which have been demonstrated for tools like Google Translate or MS Translator, as we provide recommendations for a human centered approach for future designers of AIs that perform language translation to better accommodate such low-resource languages."

Learning programs with magic values is difficult for existing program synthesis approaches. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an inductive logic programming approach to efficiently learn programs with magic values. Our experiments on diverse domains, including program synthesis, drug design, and game playing, show that our approach can (i) outperform existing approaches in terms of predictive accuracies and learning times, (ii) learn magic values from infinite domains, such as the value of pi, and (iii) scale to domains with millions of constant symbols."
208,aaai,2021,A Theory of Independent Mechanisms for Extrapolation in Generative Models,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16833,"Generative models can be trained to emulate complex empirical data, but are they useful to make predictions in the context of previously unobserved environments? An intuitive idea to promote such extrapolation capabilities is to have the architecture of such model reflect a causal graph of the true data generating process, such that one can intervene on each node independently of the others. However, the nodes of this graph are usually unobserved, leading to overparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure. We develop a theoretical framework to address this challenging situation by defining a weaker form of identifiability, based on the principle of independence of mechanisms. We demonstrate on toy examples that classical stochastic gradient descent can hinder the model's extrapolation capabilities, suggesting independence of mechanisms should be enforced explicitly during training. Experiments on deep generative models trained on real world data support these insights and illustrate how the extrapolation capabilities of such models can be leveraged."
209,aaai,2021,One SPRING to Rule Them Both: Symmetric AMR Semantic Parsing and Generation without a Complex Pipeline,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17489,"Transition-based parsers for Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) rely on node-to-word alignments. These alignments are learned separately from parser training and require a complex pipeline of rule-based components, pre-processing, and post-processing to satisfy domain-specific constraints. Parsers also train on a point-estimate of the alignment pipeline, neglecting the uncertainty due to the inherent ambiguity of alignment. In this work we explore two avenues for overcoming these limitations. First, we propose a neural aligner for AMR that learns node-to-word alignments without relying on complex pipelines. We subsequently explore a tighter integration of aligner and parser training by considering a distribution over oracle action sequences arising from aligner uncertainty. Empirical results show this approach leads to more accurate alignments and generalization better from the AMR2.0 to AMR3.0 corpora. We attain a new state-of-the art for gold-only trained models, matching silver-trained performance without the need for beam search on AMR3.0."

Modern agent architectures, such as those trained by deep reinforcement learning, are currently so lacking in interpretable structure as to effectively be black boxes, but insights may still be gained from an external, behaviourist perspective. Inspired by conceptual spaces theory, we suggest that a versatile first step towards general understanding is to discretise the state space into convex regions, jointly capturing similarities over the agent's action, value function and temporal dynamics within a dataset of observations. We create such a representation using a novel variant of the CART decision tree algorithm, and demonstrate how it facilitates practical understanding of black box agents through prediction, visualisation and rule-based explanation."

Prior work has provided sufficient perception-based modalities for traffic monitoring, in this paper, we focus on a complementary research aspect of Intelligent Transportation: traffic understanding. We scope our study to text-based methods and datasets given the abundant commonsense knowledge that can be extracted using language models from large corpus and knowledge graphs. We adopt three knowledge-driven approaches for zero-shot QA over traffic situations, based on prior natural language inference methods, commonsense models with knowledge graph self-supervision, and dense retriever-based models. We constructed two text-based multiple-choice question answering sets: BDD-QA for evaluating causal reasoning in the traffic domain and HDT-QA for measuring the possession of domain knowledge akin to human driving license tests. Among the methods, Unified-QA reaches the best performance on the BDD-QA dataset with the adaptation of multiple formats of question answers. Language models trained with inference information and commonsense knowledge are also good at predicting the cause and effect in the traffic domain but perform badly at answering human-driving QA sets. For such sets, DPR+Unified-QA performs the best due to its efficient knowledge extraction."
212,aaai,2021,Inference-Based Deterministic Messaging For Multi-Agent Communication,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17339,"In this paper, we propose a new learning technique named message-dropout to improve the performance for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning under two application scenarios: 1) classical multi-agent reinforcement learning with direct message communication among agents and 2) centralized training with decentralized execution. In the first application scenario of multi-agent systems in which direct message communication among agents is allowed, the message-dropout technique drops out the received messages from other agents in a block-wise manner with a certain probability in the training phase and compensates for this effect by multiplying the weights of the dropped-out block units with a correction probability. The applied message-dropout technique effectively handles the increased input dimension in multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication and makes learning robust against communication errors in the execution phase. In the second application scenario of centralized training with decentralized execution, we particularly consider the application of the proposed message-dropout to Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), which uses a centralized critic to train a decentralized actor for each agent. We evaluate the proposed message-dropout technique for several games, and numerical results show that the proposed message-dropout technique with proper dropout rate improves the reinforcement learning performance significantly in terms of the training speed and the steady-state performance in the execution phase."

If the first two are well known, the last one concerns independencies holding only in a subspace of the outcome space. We take advantage from the Hierarchical Multinomial Marginal models and provide several original results about the representation of context-specific independencies through these models. By considering the graphical aspect, we take advantage from the chain graphical models. The resultant graphical model is a so-called ""stratified"" chain graphical model with labelled arcs. New Markov properties are provided. Furthermore, we consider the graphical models under the regression poit of view. Here we provide simplification of the regression parameters due to the context-specific independencies. Finally, an application about the innovation degree of the Italian enterprises is provided."

In recent years, many knowledge-enhanced Commonsense Question Answering (CQA) approaches have been proposed. However, it remains unclear: (1) How far can we get by exploiting external knowledge for CQA? (2) How much potential of knowledge has been exploited in current CQA models? (3) Which are the most promising directions for future CQA? To answer these questions, we benchmark knowledge-enhanced CQA by conducting extensive experiments on multiple standard CQA datasets using a simple and effective knowledge-to-text transformation framework. Experiments show that: (1) Our knowledge-to-text framework is effective and achieves state-of-the-art performance on CommonsenseQA dataset, providing a simple and strong knowledge-enhanced baseline for CQA; (2) The potential of knowledge is still far from being fully exploited in CQA -- there is a significant performance gap from current models to our models with golden knowledge; and (3) Context-sensitive knowledge selection, heterogeneous knowledge exploitation, and commonsense-rich language models are promising CQA directions."
215,aaai,2021,Selfish Creation of Social Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16655,"Many distributed systems can be modeled as network games: a collection of selfish players that communicate in order to maximize their individual utilities. The performance of such games can be evaluated through the costs of the system equilibria: the system states in which no player can increase her utility by unilaterally changing her behavior. However, assuming that all players are selfish and in particular that all players have the same utility function may not always be appropriate. Hence, several extensions to incorporate also altruistic and malicious behavior in addition to selfishness have been proposed over the last years. In this paper, we seek to go one step further and study arbitrary relationships between participants. In particular, we introduce the notion of the social range matrix and explore the effects of the social range matrix on the equilibria in a network game. In order to derive concrete results, we propose a simplistic network creation game that captures the effect of social relationships among players."

In this work, we focus on the situation where the corresponding population risk is a degenerate non-convex loss function, namely, the Hessian of the population risk can have zero eigenvalues. Instead of analyzing the non-convex empirical risk directly, we first study the landscape of the corresponding population risk, which is usually easier to characterize, and then build a connection between the landscape of the empirical risk and its population risk. In particular, we establish a correspondence between the critical points of the empirical risk and its population risk without the strongly Morse assumption, which is required in existing literature but not satisfied in degenerate scenarios. We also apply the theory to matrix sensing and phase retrieval to demonstrate how to infer the landscape of empirical risk from that of the corresponding population risk."

Climate change poses a risk to individuals whose livelihoods depend on the health of glacier ecosystems. In this work, we present a machine learning based approach to support ecological monitoring, with a focus on glaciers. Our approach is based on semi-automated mapping from satellite images. We utilize readily available remote sensing data to create a model to identify and outline both clean ice and debris-covered glaciers from satellite imagery. We also release data and develop a web tool that allows experts to visualize and correct model predictions, with the ultimate aim of accelerating the glacier mapping process."
218,aaai,2021,Learning Augmented Methods for Matching: Improving Invasive Species Management and Urban Mobility,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17727,"Ecological imbalance owing to rapid urbanization and deforestation has adversely affected the population of several wild animals. This loss of habitat has skewed the population of several non-human primate species like chimpanzees and macaques and has constrained them to co-exist in close proximity of human settlements, often leading to human-wildlife conflicts while competing for resources. For effective wildlife conservation and conflict management, regular monitoring of population and of conflicted regions is necessary. However, existing approaches like field visits for data collection and manual analysis by experts is resource intensive, tedious and time consuming, thus necessitating an automated, non-invasive, more efficient alternative like image based facial recognition. The challenge in individual identification arises due to unrelated factors like pose, lighting variations and occlusions due to the uncontrolled environments, that is further exacerbated by limited training data. Inspired by human perception, we propose to learn representations that are robust to such nuisance factors and capture the notion of similarity over the individual identity sub-manifolds. The proposed approach, Primate Face Identification (PFID), achieves this by training the network to distinguish between positive and negative pairs of images. The PFID loss augments the standard cross entropy loss with a pairwise loss to learn more discriminative and generalizable features, thus making it appropriate for other related identification tasks like open-set, closed set and verification. We report state-of-the-art accuracy on facial recognition of two primate species, rhesus macaques and chimpanzees under the four protocols of classification, verification, closed-set identification and open-set recognition."
219,aaai,2021,Understanding Decoupled and Early Weight Decay,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16837,"Weight decay (WD) is a traditional regularization technique in deep learning, but despite its ubiquity, its behavior is still an area of active research. Golatkar et al. have recently shown that WD only matters at the start of the training in computer vision, upending traditional wisdom. Loshchilov et al. show that for adaptive optimizers, manually decaying weights can outperform adding an $l_2$ penalty to the loss. This technique has become increasingly popular and is referred to as decoupled WD. The goal of this paper is to investigate these two recent empirical observations. We demonstrate that by applying WD only at the start, the network norm stays small throughout training. This has a regularizing effect as the effective gradient updates become larger. However, traditional generalizations metrics fail to capture this effect of WD, and we show how a simple scale-invariant metric can. We also show how the growth of network weights is heavily influenced by the dataset and its generalization properties. For decoupled WD, we perform experiments in NLP and RL where adaptive optimizers are the norm. We demonstrate that the primary issue that decoupled WD alleviates is the mixing of gradients from the objective function and the $l_2$ penalty in the buffers of Adam (which stores the estimates of the first-order moment). Adaptivity itself is not problematic and decoupled WD ensures that the gradients from the $l_2$ term cannot ""drown out"" the true objective, facilitating easier hyperparameter tuning."

However, existing multi-agent learning models usually consider data fusion under fixed and compulsory collaborative relations among agents, which is not as flexible and autonomous as human collaboration. To fill this gap, we propose a distributed multi-agent learning model inspired by human collaboration, in which the agents can autonomously detect suitable collaborators and refer to collaborators' model for better performance. To implement such adaptive collaboration, we use a collaboration graph to indicate the pairwise collaborative relation. The collaboration graph can be obtained by graph learning techniques based on model similarity between different agents. Since model similarity can not be formulated by a fixed graphical optimization, we design a graph learning network by unrolling, which can learn underlying similar features among potential collaborators. By testing on both regression and classification tasks, we validate that our proposed collaboration model can figure out accurate collaborative relationship and greatly improve agents' learning performance."
221,aaai,2021,Beyond Low-frequency Information in Graph Convolutional Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16514,"Recently, a considerable literature has grown up around the theme of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). How to effectively leverage the rich structural information in complex graphs, such as knowledge graphs with heterogeneous types of entities and relations, is a primary open challenge in the field. Most GCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges (e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes only instead of jointly propagating and updating the embeddings of both nodes and edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework, namely the Knowledge Embedding based Graph Convolutional Network (KE-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based belief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge embedding (a.k.a. knowledge graph embedding) methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis shows that KE-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN methods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the advantageous performance of KE-GCN over strong baseline methods in the tasks of knowledge graph alignment and entity classification."

We provide a complete classification for the case that A is symmetric and has a flexible atom; in this case, the problem is NP-complete or in P. The classification task can be reduced to the case where A is integral. If a finite integral relation algebra has a flexible atom, then it has a normal representation B. We can then study the computational complexity of the network satisfaction problem of A using the universal-algebraic approach, via an analysis of the polymorphisms of B. We also use a Ramsey-type result of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\""odl and a complexity dichotomy result of Bulatov for conservative finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems."

Algorithms like SIW thus fail when the goal is not easily serializable in this way or when some of the subproblems have a high width. In this work, we address these limitations by using a simple but powerful language for expressing finer problem decompositions introduced recently by Bonet and Geffner, called policy sketches. A policy sketch over a set of Boolean and numerical features is a set of sketch rules that express how the values of these features are supposed to change. Like general policies, policy sketches are domain general, but unlike policies, the changes captured by sketch rules do not need to be achieved in a single step. We show that many planning domains that cannot be solved by SIW are provably solvable in low polynomial time with the SIW_R algorithm, the version of SIW that employs user-provided policy sketches. Policy sketches are thus shown to be a powerful language for expressing domain-specific knowledge in a simple and compact way and a convenient alternative to languages such as HTNs or temporal logics. Furthermore, they make it easy to express general problem decompositions and prove key properties of them like their width and complexity."

Recent studies employ the knowledge distillation (KD) method to improve the performance of quantized networks. In this study, we propose stochastic precision ensemble training for QDNNs (SPEQ). SPEQ is a knowledge distillation training scheme; however, the teacher is formed by sharing the model parameters of the student network. We obtain the soft labels of the teacher by changing the bit precision of the activation stochastically at each layer of the forward-pass computation. The student model is trained with these soft labels to reduce the activation quantization noise. The cosine similarity loss is employed, instead of the KL-divergence, for KD training. As the teacher model changes continuously by random bit-precision assignment, it exploits the effect of stochastic ensemble KD. SPEQ outperforms the existing quantization training methods in various tasks, such as image classification, question-answering, and transfer learning without the need for cumbersome teacher networks."

We believe that existing cognitive theories of human decision making, such as the thinking fast and slow theory, can provide insights on how to advance AI systems towards some of these capabilities. In this paper, we propose a general architecture that is based on fast/slow solvers and a metacognitive component. We then present experimental results on the behavior of an instance of this architecture, for AI systems that make decisions about navigating in a constrained environment. We show how combining the fast and slow decision modalities allows the system to evolve over time and gradually pass from slow to fast thinking with enough experience, and that this greatly helps in decision quality, resource consumption, and efficiency."

Most analyses using such methods explain decisions in response to inputs drawn from the test set. However, the test set may have few examples that trigger some model behaviors, such as high-confidence failures or ambiguous classifications. To address these challenges, we introduce a flexible model inspection framework: Bayes-TrEx. Given a data distribution, Bayes-TrEx finds in-distribution examples with a specified prediction confidence. We demonstrate several use cases of Bayes-TrEx, including revealing highly confident (mis)classifications, visualizing class boundaries via ambiguous examples, understanding novel-class extrapolation behavior, and exposing neural network overconfidence. We use Bayes-TrEx to study classifiers trained on CLEVR, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, and we show that this framework enables more flexible holistic model analysis than just inspecting the test set.

In this work, we explore strategies that improve cross-lingual transfer by bringing the multilingual embeddings closer in the semantic space. Our first strategy augments the original English training data with machine translation-generated data. This results in a corpus of multilingual silver-labeled QA pairs that is 14 times larger than the original training set. In addition, we propose two novel strategies, language adversarial training and language arbitration framework, which significantly improve the (zero-resource) cross-lingual transfer performance and result in LM embeddings that are less language-variant. Empirically, we show that the proposed models outperform the previous zero-shot baseline on the recently introduced multilingual MLQA and TyDiQA datasets."

At the core of this challenge is how to access contextually relevant knowledge on demand and reason over it.   In this paper, we present initial studies toward zero-shot commonsense question answering by formulating the task as inference over dynamically generated commonsense knowledge graphs. In contrast to previous studies for knowledge integration that rely on retrieval of existing knowledge from static knowledge graphs, our study requires commonsense knowledge integration where contextually relevant knowledge is often not present in existing knowledge bases. Therefore, we present a novel approach that generates contextually-relevant symbolic knowledge structures on demand using generative neural commonsense knowledge models.   Empirical results on two datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our neuro-symbolic approach for dynamically constructing knowledge graphs for reasoning. Our approach achieves significant performance boosts over pretrained language models and vanilla knowledge models, all while providing interpretable reasoning paths for its predictions."

Specifically, $n$ competitors are competing for a prize, and a tournament rule $r$ maps the result of all $\binom{n}{2}$ pairwise matches (called a tournament, $T$) to a distribution over winners. Rule $r$ is Condorcet-consistent if whenever $i$ wins all $n-1$ of her matches, $r$ selects $i$ with probability $1$.   We consider strategic manipulation of tournaments where player $j$ might throw their match to player $i$ in order to increase the likelihood that one of them wins the tournament. Regardless of the reason why $j$ chooses to do this, the potential for manipulation exists as long as $\Pr[r(T) = i]$ increases by more than $\Pr[r(T) = j]$ decreases. Unfortunately, it is known that every Condorcet-consistent rule is manipulable (Altman and Kleinberg). In this work, we address the question of how manipulable Condorcet-consistent rules must necessarily be - by trying to minimize the difference between the increase in $\Pr[r(T) = i]$ and decrease in $\Pr[r(T) = j]$ for any potential manipulating pair.   We show that every Condorcet-consistent rule is in fact $1/3$-manipulable, and that selecting a winner according to a random single elimination bracket is not $\alpha$-manipulable for any $\alpha > 1/3$. We also show that many previously studied tournament formats are all $1/2$-manipulable, and the popular class of Copeland rules (any rule that selects a player with the most wins) are all in fact $1$-manipulable, the worst possible. Finally, we consider extensions to match-fixing among sets of more than two players."

Novelty-related problems include being tolerant to novel perturbations of the normal input, detecting when the input includes novel items, and adapting to novel inputs. While significant research has been undertaken in these areas, a noticeable gap exists in the lack of a formalized definition of novelty that transcends problem domains. As a team of researchers spanning multiple research groups and different domains, we have seen, first hand, the difficulties that arise from ill-specified novelty problems, as well as inconsistent definitions and terminology. Therefore, we present the first unified framework for formal theories of novelty and use the framework to formally define a family of novelty types. Our framework can be applied across a wide range of domains, from symbolic AI to reinforcement learning, and beyond to open world image recognition. Thus, it can be used to help kick-start new research efforts and accelerate ongoing work on these important novelty-related problems. This extended version of our AAAI 2021 paper included more details and examples in multiple domains."

Existing prioritized MAPF algorithms depend on rule-of-thumb heuristics and random assignment to determine a fixed total priority ordering of all agents a priori. We instead explore the space of all possible partial priority orderings as part of a novel systematic and conflict-driven combinatorial search framework. In a variety of empirical comparisons, we demonstrate state-of-the-art solution qualities and success rates, often with similar runtimes to existing algorithms. We also develop new theoretical results that explore the limitations of prioritized planning, in terms of completeness and optimality, for the first time."

Such rationale generation models, to date, have been trained on dataset-specific crowdsourced rationales, but this approach is costly and is not generalizable to new tasks and domains. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which neural models can reason about natural language rationales that explain model predictions, relying only on distant supervision with no additional annotation cost for human-written rationales. We investigate multiple ways to automatically generate rationales using pre-trained language models, neural knowledge models, and distant supervision from related tasks, and train generative models capable of composing explanatory rationales for unseen instances. We demonstrate our approach on the defeasible inference task, a nonmonotonic reasoning task in which an inference may be strengthened or weakened when new information (an update) is introduced. Our model shows promises at generating post-hoc rationales explaining why an inference is more or less likely given the additional information, however, it mostly generates trivial rationales reflecting the fundamental limitations of neural language models. Conversely, the more realistic setup of jointly predicting the update or its type and generating rationale is more challenging, suggesting an important future direction."
236,aaai,2021,Parameterized Algorithms for MILPs with Small Treedepth,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17454,"Solving (mixed) integer linear programs, (M)ILPs for short, is a fundamental optimization task. While hard in general, recent years have brought about vast progress for solving structurally restricted, (non-mixed) ILPs: $n$-fold, tree-fold, 2-stage stochastic and multi-stage stochastic programs admit efficient algorithms, and all of these special cases are subsumed by the class of ILPs of small treedepth.   In this paper, we extend this line of work to the mixed case, by showing an algorithm solving MILP in time $f(a,d) \textrm{poly}(n)$, where $a$ is the largest coefficient of the constraint matrix, $d$ is its treedepth, and $n$ is the number of variables.   This is enabled by proving bounds on the denominators of the vertices of bounded-treedepth (non-integer) linear programs. We do so by carefully analyzing the inverses of invertible submatrices of the constraint matrix. This allows us to afford scaling up the mixed program to the integer grid, and applying the known methods for integer programs.   We trace the limiting boundary of our approach, showing that naturally related classes of linear programs have vertices of unbounded fractionality. Finally, we show that restricting the structure of only the integral variables in the constraint matrix does not yield tractable special cases."
237,aaai,2021,Successor Feature Sets: Generalizing Successor Representations Across Policies,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17399,"Successor-style representations have many advantages for reinforcement learning: for example, they can help an agent generalize from past experience to new goals, and they have been proposed as explanations of behavioral and neural data from human and animal learners. They also form a natural bridge between model-based and model-free RL methods: like the former they make predictions about future experiences, and like the latter they allow efficient prediction of total discounted rewards. However, successor-style representations are not optimized to generalize across policies: typically, we maintain a limited-length list of policies, and share information among them by representation learning or GPI. Successor-style representations also typically make no provision for gathering information or reasoning about latent variables. To address these limitations, we bring together ideas from predictive state representations, belief space value iteration, successor features, and convex analysis: we develop a new, general successor-style representation, together with a Bellman equation that connects multiple sources of information within this representation, including different latent states, policies, and reward functions. The new representation is highly expressive: for example, it lets us efficiently read off an optimal policy for a new reward function, or a policy that imitates a new demonstration. For this paper, we focus on exact computation of the new representation in small, known environments, since even this restricted setting offers plenty of interesting questions. Our implementation does not scale to large, unknown environments -- nor would we expect it to, since it generalizes POMDP value iteration, which is difficult to scale. However, we believe that future work will allow us to extend our ideas to approximate reasoning in large, unknown environments."
238,aaai,2021,Symmetric Component Caching for Model Counting on Combinatorial Instances,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16511,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an essential component in many application domains including web-based services. A variety of these services require high throughput and (close to) real-time features, for instance, to respond or react to users' requests or to process a stream of incoming data on time. However, the trend in DNN design is toward larger models with many layers and parameters to achieve more accurate results. Although these models are often pre-trained, the computational complexity in such large models can still be relatively significant, hindering low inference latency. Implementing a caching mechanism is a typical systems engineering solution for speeding up a service response time. However, traditional caching is often not suitable for DNN-based services. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end automated solution to improve the performance of DNN-based services in terms of their computational complexity and inference latency. Our caching method adopts the ideas of self-distillation of DNN models and early exits. The proposed solution is an automated online layer caching mechanism that allows early exiting of a large model during inference time if the cache model in one of the early exits is confident enough for final prediction. One of the main contributions of this paper is that we have implemented the idea as an online caching, meaning that the cache models do not need access to training data and perform solely based on the incoming data at run-time, making it suitable for applications using pre-trained models. Our experiments results on two downstream tasks (face and object classification) show that, on average, caching can reduce the computational complexity of those services up to 58\% (in terms of FLOPs count) and improve their inference latency up to 46\% with low to zero reduction in accuracy."

Learning an optimal mechanism within this class forms a partially-observable Markov decision process. We provide rigorous conditions for when this class of mechanisms is more powerful than simpler static mechanisms, for sufficiency or insufficiency of observation statistics for learning, and for the necessity of complex (deep) policies. We show that our approach can learn optimal or near-optimal mechanisms in several experimental settings."

The current methods assume that a single low-resolution image can only yield a single high-resolution image. In addition, all of these methods use low-resolution images that were artificially generated through simple bilinear down-sampling. We argue that, first and foremost, the problem of SISR is an one-to-many mapping problem between the low-resolution and all possible candidate high-resolution images and we address the challenging task of learning how to realistically degrade and down-sample high-resolution images. To circumvent this problem, we propose SR-NAM which utilizes the Non-Adversarial Mapping (NAM) technique. Furthermore, we propose a degradation model that learns how to transform high-resolution images to low-resolution images that resemble realistically taken low-resolution photos. Finally, some qualitative results for the proposed method along with the weaknesses of SR-NAM are included."

Several past studies have modeled this relationship for the games played during the March Madness tournament, and this work aims at verifying if the models advocated in these papers still perform well for regular season games. Indeed, most previous articles have shown that a simple quadratic regression model provides fairly accurate predictions of the margin of victory when team rankings only range from 1 to 16. Does that still hold true when team rankings can go as high as 351? Do the model assumptions hold? Can we find semi- or non-parametric methods that yield even better results (i.e. predicted margins of victory that more closely resemble actual results)? The analyses presented in this paper suggest that the answer is ""yes"" on all three counts!"

It is concerned with finding a matching between two disjoint sets of agents wherein no pair of agents prefer each other to their matched partners. The Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm is an elegant procedure that guarantees a stable matching for any input; however, its outcome may be unfair as it always favors one side by returning a matching that is optimal for one side (say men) and pessimal for the other side (say women). A desirable fairness notion is minimizing the sex-equality cost, i.e. the difference between the total rankings of both sides. Computing such stable matchings is a strongly NP-hard problem, which raises the question of what tractable algorithms to adopt in practice. We conduct a series of empirical evaluations on the properties of sex-equal stable matchings when preferences of agents on both sides are correlated. Our empirical results suggest that under correlated preferences, the DA algorithm returns stable matchings with low sex-equality cost, which further confirms its broad use in many practical applications."
243,aaai,2021,On the Tractability of SHAP Explanations,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16806,"SHAP explanations are a popular feature-attribution mechanism for explainable AI. They use game-theoretic notions to measure the influence of individual features on the prediction of a machine learning model. Despite a lot of recent interest from both academia and industry, it is not known whether SHAP explanations of common machine learning models can be computed efficiently. In this paper, we establish the complexity of computing the SHAP explanation in three important settings. First, we consider fully-factorized data distributions, and show that the complexity of computing the SHAP explanation is the same as the complexity of computing the expected value of the model. This fully-factorized setting is often used to simplify the SHAP computation, yet our results show that the computation can be intractable for commonly used models such as logistic regression. Going beyond fully-factorized distributions, we show that computing SHAP explanations is already intractable for a very simple setting: computing SHAP explanations of trivial classifiers over naive Bayes distributions. Finally, we show that even computing SHAP over the empirical distribution is #P-hard."

The key idea behind the method is to map a vector of hidden parameters of the network to a point that is guaranteed to be inside the feasible set defined by a set of constraints. The mapping is implemented by the additional neural network layer with constraints for output. The proposed method is simply extended to the case when constraints are imposed not only on the output vectors, but also on joint constraints depending on inputs. The projection approach to imposing constraints on outputs can simply be implemented in the framework of the proposed method. It is shown how to incorporate different types of constraints into the proposed method, including linear and quadratic constraints, equality constraints, and dynamic constraints, constraints in the form of boundaries. An important feature of the method is its computational simplicity. Complexities of the forward pass of the proposed neural network layer by linear and quadratic constraints are O(n*m) and O(n^2*m), respectively, where n is the number of variables, m is the number of constraints. Numerical experiments illustrate the method by solving optimization and classification problems. The code implementing the method is publicly available."

However, in a variety of situations we may have additional requirements or knowledge, distinct from the underlying metric, regarding which pairs of points should be clustered together. To capture and analyze such scenarios, we introduce a novel family of \emph{stochastic pairwise constraints}, which we incorporate into several essential clustering objectives (radius/median/means). Moreover, we demonstrate that these constraints can succinctly model an intriguing collection of applications, including among others \emph{Individual Fairness} in clustering and \emph{Must-link} constraints in semi-supervised learning. Our main result consists of a general framework that yields approximation algorithms with provable guarantees for important clustering objectives, while at the same time producing solutions that respect the stochastic pairwise constraints. Furthermore, for certain objectives we devise improved results in the case of Must-link constraints, which are also the best possible from a theoretical perspective. Finally, we present experimental evidence that validates the effectiveness of our algorithms."

We evaluate our Conversational Agent Interface for MIT App Inventor and workshop curriculum with respect to eight AI competencies from the literature. Furthermore, we analyze teacher (n=9) and student (n=47) feedback from workshops with the interface and recommend that future work leverages design considerations from the literature to optimize engagement, collaborates with teachers, and addresses a range of student abilities through pacing and opportunities for extension.

This is achieved via the secure and insecure sets defined for each model member on a given sample, hence help us to quantify and regularize the transferability. Consequently, our proposed framework provides the flexibility to reduce the adversarial transferability as well as to promote the diversity of ensemble members, which are two crucial factors for better robustness in our ensemble approach. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments to demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art ensemble baselines, at the same time can detect a wide range of adversarial examples with a nearly perfect accuracy.

In the existing routing procedures, capsules produce predictions (termed votes) for capsules of the next layer. In a nutshell, the next-layer capsule's input is a weighted sum over all the votes it receives. In this paper, we propose non-iterative cluster routing for capsule networks. In the proposed cluster routing, capsules produce vote clusters instead of individual votes for next-layer capsules, and each vote cluster sends its centroid to a next-layer capsule. Generally speaking, the next-layer capsule's input is a weighted sum over the centroid of each vote cluster it receives. The centroid that comes from a cluster with a smaller variance is assigned a larger weight in the weighted sum process. Compared with the state-of-the-art capsule networks, the proposed capsule networks achieve the best accuracy on the Fashion-MNIST and SVHN datasets with fewer parameters, and achieve the best accuracy on the smallNORB and CIFAR-10 datasets with a moderate number of parameters. The proposed capsule networks also produce capsules with disentangled representation and generalize well to images captured at novel viewpoints. The proposed capsule networks also preserve 2D spatial information of an input image in the capsule channels: if the capsule channels are rotated, the object reconstructed from these channels will be rotated by the same transformation.

Inspired by a recent stream of work, we study welfare guarantees and complexity in this model with respect to several welfare measures. First, we show that while maximizing the social welfare is NP-hard, computing an assignment of agents to the nodes of any topology graph with approximately half of the maximum welfare can be done in polynomial time. We then consider Pareto optimality, introduce two new optimality notions based on it, and establish mostly tight bounds on the worst-case welfare loss for assignments satisfying these notions as well as the complexity of computing such assignments. In addition, we show that for tree topologies, it is possible to decide whether there exists an assignment that gives every agent a positive utility in polynomial time; moreover, when every node in the topology has degree at least $2$, such an assignment always exists and can be found efficiently."

As alternative, we present an efficient message passing algorithm that computes the probability distribution of the cascade size for the Independent Cascade Model on weighted directed networks and generalizations. Our approach is exact on trees but can be applied to any network topology. It approximates locally tree-like networks well, scales to large networks, and can lead to surprisingly good performance on more dense networks, as we also exemplify on real world data."

It requires an advanced approach for high-performance contingency analysis as a safeguard of the power system operation. In this paper, a graph-based method is employed for N-1 contingency analysis (CA) fast screening. At first, bi-directional breadth-first search (BFS) is proposed and adopted on graph model to detect the potential shedding component in contingency analysis. It implements hierarchical parallelism of the graph traverse and speedup its process. Then, the idea of evolving graph is introduced in this paper to improve computation performance. For each contingency scenario, N-1 contingency graph quickly derives from system graph in basic status, and parallelly analyzes each contingency scenario using graph computing. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach have been tested and verified by IEEE 118-bus system and a practical case SC 2645-bus system."

Notably, the major depressive disorder has become a common problem among higher education students, aggravated, and maybe even occasioned, by the academic pressures they must face. While the reasons for this alarming situation remain unclear (although widely investigated), the student already facing this problem must receive treatment. To that, it is first necessary to screen the symptoms. The traditional way for that is relying on clinical consultations or answering questionnaires. However, nowadays, the data shared at social media is a ubiquitous source that can be used to detect the depression symptoms even when the student is not able to afford or search for professional care. Previous works have already relied on social media data to detect depression on the general population, usually focusing on either posted images or texts or relying on metadata. In this work, we focus on detecting the severity of the depression symptoms in higher education students, by comparing deep learning to feature engineering models induced from both the pictures and their captions posted on Instagram. The experimental results show that students presenting a BDI score higher or equal than 20 can be detected with 0.92 of recall and 0.69 of precision in the best case, reached by a fusion model. Our findings show the potential of large-scale depression screening, which could shed light upon students at-risk."

Most of the existing domain adaptation methods for time-series data borrow the ideas from the existing methods for non-time series data to extract the domain-invariant representation. However, two peculiar difficulties to time-series data have not been solved. 1) It is not a trivial task to model the domain-invariant and complex dependence among different timestamps. 2) The domain-variant information is important but how to leverage them is almost underexploited. Fortunately, the stableness of causal structures among different domains inspires us to explore the structures behind the time-series data. Based on this inspiration, we investigate the domain-invariant unweighted sparse associative structures and the domain-variant strengths of the structures. To achieve this, we propose Sparse Associative structure alignment by learning Invariance and Variance (SASA-IV in short), a model that simultaneously aligns the invariant unweighted spare associative structures and considers the variant information for time-series unsupervised domain adaptation. Technologically, we extract the domain-invariant unweighted sparse associative structures with a unidirectional alignment restriction and embed the domain-variant strengths via a well-designed autoregressive module. Experimental results not only testify that our model yields state-of-the-art performance on three real-world datasets but also provide some insightful discoveries on knowledge transfer."

Recently enlightening progress has been made, but the performance of existing methods are unsatisfactory on real datasets where the new target domain comprises of heterogeneous sub-domains (e.g., diverse weather characteristics). We point out that carefully reasoning about the multiple modalities in the target domain can improve the robustness of adaptation models. To this end, we propose a condition-guided adaptation framework that is empowered by a special attentive progressive adversarial training (APAT) mechanism and a novel self-training policy. The APAT strategy progressively performs condition-specific alignment and attentive global feature matching. The new self-training scheme exploits the adversarial ambivalences of easy and hard adaptation regions and the correlations among target sub-domains effectively. We evaluate our method (DCAA) on various adaptation scenarios where the target images vary in weather conditions. The comparisons against baselines and the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the superiority of DCAA over the competitors."

We show that in order to verify that two tensors are generated by the same (possibly scaled) terms it is not necessary to compute the individual decompositions. In general the explicit computation of such a decomposition may have high complexity and can be ill-conditioned. We now show that under some assumptions the verification can be reduced to a comparison of both the column and row spaces of the corresponding matrix representations of the tensors. We consider rank-1 terms as well as low multilinear rank terms (also known as block terms) and show that the number of the terms and their multilinear rank can be inferred as well. The comparison relies only on numerical linear algebra and can be done in a numerically reliable way. We also illustrate how our results can be applied to solve a multi-label classification problem that appears in the context of blind source separation.

The backbone network for object detection is usually obtained on the image classification task. However, the architecture which is searched through the classification task is sub-optimal because of the gap between the task of image and object detection. As while work focuses on backbone network architecture search for mobile device object detection is limited, mainly because the backbone always requires expensive ImageNet pre-training. Accordingly, it is necessary to study the approach of network architecture search for mobile device object detection without expensive pre-training. In this work, we propose a mobile object detection backbone network architecture search algorithm which is a kind of evolutionary optimized method based on non-dominated sorting for NAS scenarios. It can quickly search to obtain the backbone network architecture within certain constraints. It better solves the problem of suboptimal linear combination accuracy and computational cost. The proposed approach can search the backbone networks with different depths, widths, or expansion sizes via a technique of weight mapping, making it possible to use NAS for mobile devices detection tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on YoloX-Lite, a lightweight version of the target detection framework. Under similar computational complexity, the accuracy of the backbone network architecture we search for is 2.0% mAP higher than MobileDet. Our improved backbone network can reduce the computational effort while improving the accuracy of the object detection network. To prove its effectiveness, a series of ablation studies have been carried out and the working mechanism has been analyzed in detail."

However, there does not exist a dataset or benchmark designed for such a task. To this end, we collect a large-scale object localization and counting dataset with rich annotations in retail stores, which consists of 50,394 images with more than 1.9 million object instances in 140 categories. Together with this dataset, we provide a new evaluation protocol and divide the training and testing subsets to fairly evaluate the performance of algorithms for Locount, developing a new benchmark for the Locount task. Moreover, we present a cascaded localization and counting network as a strong baseline, which gradually classifies and regresses the bounding boxes of objects with the predicted numbers of instances enclosed in the bounding boxes, trained in an end-to-end manner.

To successfully pick an item from an unstructured bin the robot needs to first detect possible grasps for the objects, decide on the object to remove and consequently plan and execute a feasible trajectory to retrieve the chosen object. Over the last years significant progress has been made towards solving these problems. However, when multiple robot arms are cooperating the decision and planning problems become exponentially harder. We propose an integrated multi-arm bin-picking pipeline (IMAPIP), and demonstrate that it is able to reliably pick objects from a bin in real-time using multiple robot arms. IMAPIP solves the multi-arm bin-picking task first at high-level using a geometry-aware policy integrated in a combined task and motion planning framework. We then plan motions consistent with this policy using the BIT* algorithm on the motion planning level. We show that this integrated solution enables robot arm cooperation. In our experiments, we show the proposed geometry-aware policy outperforms a baseline by increasing bin-picking time by 28\% using two robot arms. The policy is robust to changes in the position of the bin and number of objects. We also show that IMAPIP to successfully scale up to four robot arms working in close proximity."
261,aaai,2021,Appearance-Motion Memory Consistency Network for Video Anomaly Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16177,"The interest for video anomaly detection systems has gained traction for the past few years. The current approaches use deep learning to perform anomaly detection in videos, but this approach has multiple problems. For starters, deep learning in general has issues with noise, concept drift, explainability, and training data volumes. Additionally, anomaly detection in itself is a complex task and faces challenges such as unknowness, heterogeneity, and class imbalance. Anomaly detection using deep learning is therefore mainly constrained to generative models such as generative adversarial networks and autoencoders due to their unsupervised nature, but even they suffer from general deep learning issues and are hard to train properly. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm to perform anomaly detection in videos, as it has favorable properties such as noise tolerance and online learning which combats concept drift. We introduce a novel version of HTM, namely, Grid HTM, which is an HTM-based architecture specifically for anomaly detection in complex videos such as surveillance footage."
262,aaai,2021,Extracting Zero-shot Structured Information from Form-like Documents: Pretraining with Keys and Triggers,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17494,"Joint-event-extraction, which extracts structural information (i.e., entities or triggers of events) from unstructured real-world corpora, has attracted more and more research attention in natural language processing. Most existing works do not fully address the sparse co-occurrence relationships between entities and triggers, which loses this important information and thus deteriorates the extraction performance. To mitigate this issue, we first define the joint-event-extraction as a sequence-to-sequence labeling task with a tag set composed of tags of triggers and entities. Then, to incorporate the missing information in the aforementioned co-occurrence relationships, we propose a Cross-Supervised Mechanism (CSM) to alternately supervise the extraction of either triggers or entities based on the type distribution of each other. Moreover, since the connected entities and triggers naturally form a heterogeneous information network (HIN), we leverage the latent pattern along meta-paths for a given corpus to further improve the performance of our proposed method. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets as well as compare our method with state-of-the-art methods. Empirical results and analysis show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both entity and trigger extraction."
263,aaai,2021,A Bottom-Up DAG Structure Extraction Model for Math Word Problems,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16075,"We propose a new differentiable probabilistic model over DAGs (DP-DAG). DP-DAG allows fast and differentiable DAG sampling suited to continuous optimization. To this end, DP-DAG samples a DAG by successively (1) sampling a linear ordering of the node and (2) sampling edges consistent with the sampled linear ordering. We further propose VI-DP-DAG, a new method for DAG learning from observational data which combines DP-DAG with variational inference. Hence,VI-DP-DAG approximates the posterior probability over DAG edges given the observed data. VI-DP-DAG is guaranteed to output a valid DAG at any time during training and does not require any complex augmented Lagrangian optimization scheme in contrast to existing differentiable DAG learning approaches. In our extensive experiments, we compare VI-DP-DAG to other differentiable DAG learning baselines on synthetic and real datasets. VI-DP-DAG significantly improves DAG structure and causal mechanism learning while training faster than competitors."

We test HemCNN's decoding capabilities to decode in a streaming way the hand, left or right, from fNIRS data. HemCNN learned to detect which hand executed a grasp at a naturalistic hand action speed of $~1\,$Hz, outperforming standard methods. Since HemCNN does not require baseline correction and the convolution operation is invariant to time translations, our method can help to unlock fNIRS for a variety of real-time tasks. Mobile brain imaging and mobile brain machine interfacing can benefit from this to develop real-world neuroscience and practical human neural interfacing based on BOLD-like signals for the evaluation, assistance and rehabilitation of force generation, such as fusion of fNIRS with EEG signals."
265,aaai,2021,Provably Secure Federated Learning against Malicious Clients,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16849,"Federated learning enables clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model without sharing their local training data with a cloud server. However, malicious clients can corrupt the global model to predict incorrect labels for testing examples. Existing defenses against malicious clients leverage Byzantine-robust federated learning methods. However, these methods cannot provably guarantee that the predicted label for a testing example is not affected by malicious clients. We bridge this gap via ensemble federated learning. In particular, given any base federated learning algorithm, we use the algorithm to learn multiple global models, each of which is learnt using a randomly selected subset of clients. When predicting the label of a testing example, we take majority vote among the global models. We show that our ensemble federated learning with any base federated learning algorithm is provably secure against malicious clients. Specifically, the label predicted by our ensemble global model for a testing example is provably not affected by a bounded number of malicious clients. Moreover, we show that our derived bound is tight. We evaluate our method on MNIST and Human Activity Recognition datasets. For instance, our method can achieve a certified accuracy of 88% on MNIST when 20 out of 1,000 clients are malicious."
266,aaai,2021,Open-Set Recognition with Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16848,"We present a novel end-to-end partially supervised deep learning approach for video anomaly detection and localization using only normal samples. The insight that motivates this study is that the normal samples can be associated with at least one Gaussian component of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), while anomalies either do not belong to any Gaussian component. The method is based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder, which can learn feature representations of the normal samples as a Gaussian Mixture Model trained using deep learning. A Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) that does not contain a fully-connected layer is employed for the encoder-decoder structure to preserve relative spatial coordinates between the input image and the output feature map. Based on the joint probabilities of each of the Gaussian mixture components, we introduce a sample energy based method to score the anomaly of image test patches. A two-stream network framework is employed to combine the appearance and motion anomalies, using RGB frames for the former and dynamic flow images, for the latter. We test our approach on two popular benchmarks (UCSD Dataset and Avenue Dataset). The experimental results verify the superiority of our method compared to the state of the arts."
267,aaai,2021,Dual Quaternion Knowledge Graph Embeddings,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16850,"Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an important and active research direction in deep learning. It is worth noting that most of the existing GNN-based methods learn graph representations within the Euclidean vector space. Beyond the Euclidean space, learning representation and embeddings in hyper-complex space have also shown to be a promising and effective approach. To this end, we propose Quaternion Graph Neural Networks (QGNN) to learn graph representations within the Quaternion space. As demonstrated, the Quaternion space, a hyper-complex vector space, provides highly meaningful computations and analogical calculus through Hamilton product compared to the Euclidean and complex vector spaces. Our QGNN obtains state-of-the-art results on a range of benchmark datasets for graph classification and node classification. Besides, regarding knowledge graphs, our QGNN-based embedding model achieves state-of-the-art results on three new and challenging benchmark datasets for knowledge graph completion.

We have designed and implemented a type-preserving compiler for a simply-typed dialect of Prolog we call T-Prolog. The crux of our approach is a new certifying abstract machine which we call the Typed Warren Abstract Machine (TWAM). The TWAM has a dependent type system strong enough to specify the semantics of a logic program in the logical framework LF. We present a soundness metatheorem which constitutes a partial correctness guarantee: well-typed programs implement the logic program specified by their type. This metatheorem justifies our design and implementation of a certifying compiler from T-Prolog to TWAM.
269,aaai,2021,Combining Reinforcement Learning and Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16484,"Combinatorial optimization has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace to transportation planning and economics. The goal is to find an optimal solution among a finite set of possibilities. The well-known challenge one faces with combinatorial optimization is the state-space explosion problem: the number of possibilities grows exponentially with the problem size, which makes solving intractable for large problems. In the last years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown its promise for designing good heuristics dedicated to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. However, current approaches have two shortcomings: (1) they mainly focus on the standard travelling salesman problem and they cannot be easily extended to other problems, and (2) they only provide an approximate solution with no systematic ways to improve it or to prove optimality. In another context, constraint programming (CP) is a generic tool to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Based on a complete search procedure, it will always find the optimal solution if we allow an execution time large enough. A critical design choice, that makes CP non-trivial to use in practice, is the branching decision, directing how the search space is explored. In this work, we propose a general and hybrid approach, based on DRL and CP, for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The core of our approach is based on a dynamic programming formulation, that acts as a bridge between both techniques. We experimentally show that our solver is efficient to solve two challenging problems: the traveling salesman problem with time windows, and the 4-moments portfolio optimization problem. Results obtained show that the framework introduced outperforms the stand-alone RL and CP solutions, while being competitive with industrial solvers."

This has become a topic of recent interest as a way to query a trained model and suggest possible actions to overturn its decision. Mathematically, the problem is formally equivalent to that of finding adversarial examples, which also has attracted significant attention recently. Most work on either counterfactual explanations or adversarial examples has focused on differentiable classifiers, such as neural nets. We focus on classification trees, both axis-aligned and oblique (having hyperplane splits). Although here the counterfactual optimization problem is nonconvex and nondifferentiable, we show that an exact solution can be computed very efficiently, even with high-dimensional feature vectors and with both continuous and categorical features, and demonstrate it in different datasets and settings. The results are particularly relevant for finance, medicine or legal applications, where interpretability and counterfactual explanations are particularly important."
271,aaai,2021,Semantic MapNet: Building Allocentric Semantic Maps and Representations from Egocentric Views,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16180,"We study the task of semantic mapping - specifically, an embodied agent (a robot or an egocentric AI assistant) is given a tour of a new environment and asked to build an allocentric top-down semantic map (""what is where?"") from egocentric observations of an RGB-D camera with known pose (via localization sensors). Towards this goal, we present SemanticMapNet (SMNet), which consists of: (1) an Egocentric Visual Encoder that encodes each egocentric RGB-D frame, (2) a Feature Projector that projects egocentric features to appropriate locations on a floor-plan, (3) a Spatial Memory Tensor of size floor-plan length x width x feature-dims that learns to accumulate projected egocentric features, and (4) a Map Decoder that uses the memory tensor to produce semantic top-down maps. SMNet combines the strengths of (known) projective camera geometry and neural representation learning. On the task of semantic mapping in the Matterport3D dataset, SMNet significantly outperforms competitive baselines by 4.01-16.81% (absolute) on mean-IoU and 3.81-19.69% (absolute) on Boundary-F1 metrics. Moreover, we show how to use the neural episodic memories and spatio-semantic allocentric representations build by SMNet for subsequent tasks in the same space - navigating to objects seen during the tour(""Find chair"") or answering questions about the space (""How many chairs did you see in the house?"").

Previous works only show their effectiveness but fail short to explain and interpret the internal workings fully. In this paper, we analyze curriculum learning in sentiment analysis along multiple axes. Some of these axes have been proposed by earlier works that need more in-depth study. Such analysis requires understanding where curriculum learning works and where it does not. Our axes of analysis include Task difficulty on CL, comparing CL pacing techniques, and qualitative analysis by visualizing the movement of attention scores in the model as curriculum phases progress. We find that curriculum learning works best for difficult tasks and may even lead to a decrement in performance for tasks with higher performance without curriculum learning. We see that One-Pass curriculum strategies suffer from catastrophic forgetting and attention movement visualization within curriculum pacing. This shows that curriculum learning breaks down the challenging main task into easier sub-tasks solved sequentially."
273,aaai,2021,Contextual Conditional Reasoning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16777,"Contextual refinement (CR) is one of the standard notions of specifying open programs. CR has two main advantages: (i) (horizontal and vertical) compositionality that allows us to decompose a large contextual refinement into many smaller ones enabling modular and incremental verification, and (ii) no restriction on programming features thereby allowing, e.g., mutually recursive, pointer-value passing, and higher-order functions. However, CR has a downside that it cannot impose conditions on the context since it quantifies over all contexts, which indeed plays a key role in support of full compositionality and programming features.   In this paper, we address the problem of finding a notion of refinement that satisfies all three requirements: support of full compositionality, full (sequential) programming features, and rich conditions on the context. As a solution, we propose a new theory of refinement, called CCR (Conditional Contextual Refinement), and develop a verification framework based on it, which allows us to modularly and incrementally verify a concrete module against an abstract module under separation-logic-style pre and post conditions about external modules. It is fully formalized in Coq and provides a proof mode that combines (i) simulation reasoning about preservation of sideffects such as IO events and termination and (ii) propositional reasoning about pre and post conditions. Also, the verification results are combined with CompCert, so that we formally establish behavioral refinement from top-level abstract programs, all the way down to their assembly code."
274,aaai,2021,Frivolous Units: Wider Networks Are Not Really That Wide,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16853,"A remarkable characteristic of overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) is that their accuracy does not degrade when the network's width is increased. Recent evidence suggests that developing compressible representations is key for adjusting the complexity of large networks to the learning task at hand. However, these compressible representations are poorly understood. A promising strand of research inspired from biology is understanding representations at the unit level as it offers a more granular and intuitive interpretation of the neural mechanisms. In order to better understand what facilitates increases in width without decreases in accuracy, we ask: Are there mechanisms at the unit level by which networks control their effective complexity as their width is increased? If so, how do these depend on the architecture, dataset, and training parameters? We identify two distinct types of ""frivolous"" units that proliferate when the network's width is increased: prunable units which can be dropped out of the network without significant change to the output and redundant units whose activities can be expressed as a linear combination of others. These units imply complexity constraints as the function the network represents could be expressed by a network without them. We also identify how the development of these units can be influenced by architecture and a number of training factors. Together, these results help to explain why the accuracy of DNNs does not degrade when width is increased and highlight the importance of frivolous units toward understanding implicit regularization in DNNs."

In particular, we study district-based elections with two candidates, in which the winner of the election is the candidate that wins in the majority of the districts. District-based elections are adopted worldwide (e.g., UK and USA) and are a natural extension of widely studied voting mechanisms (e.g., k-voting and plurality voting). We resort to the Bayesian persuasion framework, where the manipulator (sender) strategically discloses information to the voters (receivers) that update their beliefs rationally. We study both private signaling, in which the sender can use a private communication channel per receiver, and public signaling, in which the sender can use a single communication channel for all the receivers. Furthermore, for the first time, we introduce semi-public signaling in which the sender can use a single communication channel per district. We show that there is a sharp distinction between private and (semi-)public signaling. In particular, optimal private signaling schemes can provide an arbitrarily better probability of victory than (semi-)public ones and can be computed efficiently, while optimal (semi-)public signaling schemes cannot be approximated to within any factor in polynomial time unless P=NP. However, we show that reasonable relaxations allow the design of multi-criteria PTASs for optimal (semi-)public signaling schemes. In doing so, we introduce a novel property, namely comparative stability, and we design a bi-criteria PTAS for public signaling in general Bayesian persuasion problems beyond elections when the sender's utility function is state-dependent."

Despite their ubiquitous applications, it is not clear whether it is possible to design information structures to ameliorate the overall experience of the network users. We focus on Bayesian games with atomic players, where network vagaries are modeled via a (random) state of nature which determines the costs incurred by the players. A third-party entity---the sender---can observe the realized state of the network and exploit this additional information to send a signal to each player. A natural question is the following: is it possible for an informed sender to reduce the overall social cost via the strategic provision of information to players who update their beliefs rationally? The paper focuses on the problem of computing optimal ex ante persuasive signaling schemes, showing that symmetry is a crucial property for its solution. Indeed, we show that an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time when players are symmetric and have affine cost functions. Moreover, the problem becomes NP-hard when players are asymmetric, even in non-Bayesian settings."
277,aaai,2021,Computing Quantal Stackelberg Equilibrium in Extensive-Form Games,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16664,"Optimizing strategic decisions (a.k.a. computing equilibrium) is key to the success of many non-cooperative multi-agent applications. However, in many real-world situations, we may face the exact opposite of this game-theoretic problem -- instead of prescribing equilibrium of a given game, we may directly observe the agents' equilibrium behaviors but want to infer the underlying parameters of an unknown game. This research question, also known as inverse game theory, has been studied in multiple recent works in the context of Stackelberg games. Unfortunately, existing works exhibit quite negative results, showing statistical hardness and computational hardness, assuming follower's perfectly rational behaviors. Our work relaxes the perfect rationality agent assumption to the classic quantal response model, a more realistic behavior model of bounded rationality. Interestingly, we show that the smooth property brought by such bounded rationality model actually leads to provably more efficient learning of the follower utility parameters in general Stackelberg games. Systematic empirical experiments on synthesized games confirm our theoretical results and further suggest its robustness beyond the strict quantal response model."

It is straightforward that existential rule queries exhibiting chase termination are decidable and can only recognize properties that are preserved under homomorphisms. In this paper, we show the converse: every decidable query that is closed under homomorphism can be expressed by an existential rule set for which the standard chase universally terminates. Membership in this fragment is not decidable, but we show via a diagonalisation argument that this is unavoidable."

Probabilistic machine learning and especially the Bayesian formalism provide a systematic framework to incorporate robustness through the distributional estimates and reason about uncertainty. Recent works have shown that approximate inference approaches that take the weight space uncertainty of neural networks to generate ensemble prediction are the state-of-the-art. However, architecture choices have mostly been ad hoc, which essentially ignores the epistemic uncertainty from the architecture space. To this end, we propose a Unified probabilistic architecture and weight ensembling Neural Architecture Search (UraeNAS) that leverages advances in probabilistic neural architecture search and approximate Bayesian inference to generate ensembles form the joint distribution of neural network architectures and weights. The proposed approach showed a significant improvement both with in-distribution (0.86% in accuracy, 42% in ECE) CIFAR-10 and out-of-distribution (2.43% in accuracy, 30% in ECE) CIFAR-10-C compared to the baseline deterministic approach."

Learning to Predict Readability of Bengali Texts,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17495,"Determining the readability of a text is the first step to its simplification. In this paper, we present a readability analysis tool capable of analyzing text written in the Bengali language to provide in-depth information on its readability and complexity. Despite being the 7th most spoken language in the world with 230 million native speakers, Bengali suffers from a lack of fundamental resources for natural language processing. Readability related research of the Bengali language so far can be considered to be narrow and sometimes faulty due to the lack of resources. Therefore, we correctly adopt document-level readability formulas traditionally used for U.S. based education system to the Bengali language with a proper age-to-age comparison. Due to the unavailability of large-scale human-annotated corpora, we further divide the document-level task into sentence-level and experiment with neural architectures, which will serve as a baseline for the future works of Bengali readability prediction. During the process, we present several human-annotated corpora and dictionaries such as a document-level dataset comprising 618 documents with 12 different grade levels, a large-scale sentence-level dataset comprising more than 96K sentences with simple and complex labels, a consonant conjunct count algorithm and a corpus of 341 words to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, a list of 3,396 easy words, and an updated pronunciation dictionary with more than 67K words.

Mean shift algorithms have been effectively used for data denoising, mode seeking, and finding the number of clusters in a dataset in an automated fashion. However, the merits of mean shift quickly fade away as the data dimensions increase and only a handful of features contain useful information about the cluster structure of the data. We propose a simple yet elegant feature-weighted variant of mean shift to efficiently learn the feature importance and thus, extending the merits of mean shift to high-dimensional data. The resulting algorithm not only outperforms the conventional mean shift clustering procedure but also preserves its computational simplicity. In addition, the proposed method comes with rigorous theoretical convergence guarantees and a convergence rate of at least a cubic order. The efficacy of our proposal is thoroughly assessed through experimental comparison against baseline and state-of-the-art clustering methods on synthetic as well as real-world datasets."

Generally, video super-resolution contains a significant component, i.e., motion compensation, which is used to estimate the displacement between successive video frames for temporal alignment. Optical flow, which can supply dense and sub-pixel motion between consecutive frames, is among the most common ways for this task. To obtain a good understanding of the effect that optical flow acts in video super-resolution, in this work, we conduct a comprehensive review on this subject for the first time. This investigation covers the following major topics: the function of super-resolution (i.e., why we require super-resolution); the concept of video super-resolution (i.e., what is video super-resolution); the description of evaluation metrics (i.e., how (video) superresolution performs); the introduction of optical flow based video super-resolution; the investigation of using optical flow to capture temporal dependency for video super-resolution. Prominently, we give an in-depth study of the deep learning based video super-resolution method, where some representative algorithms are analyzed and compared. Additionally, we highlight some promising research directions and open issues that should be further addressed."

It consists in weighting the respondents at a given follow-up by their inverse probability to participate. Weights are estimated first and then used in a weighted association model. When the IPW method is used, instead of using a so-called na{\""i}ve variance estimator, the literature recommends using a robust variance estimator. However, the latter may overestimate the variance because the weights are considered known rather than estimated. In this note, we develop, by a linearization technique, an estimator accounting for the weight estimation phase and explain how it differs from na{\""i}ve and robust variance estimators. We compare the three variance estimators through simulations under several MAR and MNAR scenarios. We found that both the robust and linearized variance estimators were approximately unbiased, even in MNAR scenarios. The naive variance estimator severely underestimated the variance. We encourage researchers to be careful with variance estimation when using the IPW method, avoiding na{\""i}ve estimator and opting for a robust or linearized estimator. R and SAS codes are provided to implement them in their own studies."

We propose a novel embedding method for a text sequence (a phrase or a sentence) where each sequence is represented by a distinct set of multi-mode codebook embeddings to capture different semantic facets of its meaning. The codebook embeddings can be viewed as the cluster centers which summarize the distribution of possibly co-occurring words in a pre-trained word embedding space. We introduce an end-to-end trainable neural model that directly predicts the set of cluster centers from the input text sequence during test time. Our experiments show that the per-sentence codebook embeddings significantly improve the performances in unsupervised sentence similarity and extractive summarization benchmarks. In phrase similarity experiments, we discover that the multi-facet embeddings provide an interpretable semantic representation but do not outperform the single-facet baseline."
285,aaai,2021,Provable Benefits of Overparameterization in Model Compression: From Double Descent to Pruning Neural Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16859,"Deep networks are typically trained with many more parameters than the size of the training dataset. Recent empirical evidence indicates that the practice of overparameterization not only benefits training large models, but also assists - perhaps counterintuitively - building lightweight models. Specifically, it suggests that overparameterization benefits model pruning / sparsification. This paper sheds light on these empirical findings by theoretically characterizing the high-dimensional asymptotics of model pruning in the overparameterized regime. The theory presented addresses the following core question: ""should one train a small model from the beginning, or first train a large model and then prune?"". We analytically identify regimes in which, even if the location of the most informative features is known, we are better off fitting a large model and then pruning rather than simply training with the known informative features. This leads to a new double descent in the training of sparse models: growing the original model, while preserving the target sparsity, improves the test accuracy as one moves beyond the overparameterization threshold. Our analysis further reveals the benefit of retraining by relating it to feature correlations. We find that the above phenomena are already present in linear and random-features models. Our technical approach advances the toolset of high-dimensional analysis and precisely characterizes the asymptotic distribution of over-parameterized least-squares. The intuition gained by analytically studying simpler models is numerically verified on neural networks."

While high-resolution weather models can forecast many types of extreme events on synoptic timescales, long-term climatological risk assessment is an altogether different problem. A once-in-a-century event takes, on average, 100 years of simulation time to appear just once, far beyond the typical integration length of a weather forecast model. Therefore, this task is left to cheaper, but less accurate, low-resolution or statistical models. But there is untapped potential in weather model output: despite being short in duration, weather forecast ensembles are produced multiple times a week. Integrations are launched with independent perturbations, causing them to spread apart over time and broadly sample phase space. Collectively, these integrations add up to thousands of years of data. We establish methods to extract climatological information from these short weather simulations. Using ensemble hindcasts by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) archived in the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) database, we characterize sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events with multi-centennial return times. Consistent results are found between alternative methods, including basic counting strategies and Markov state modeling. By carefully combining trajectories together, we obtain estimates of SSW frequencies and their seasonal distributions that are consistent with reanalysis-derived estimates for moderately rare events, but with much tighter uncertainty bounds, and which can be extended to events of unprecedented severity that have not yet been observed historically. These methods hold potential for assessing extreme events throughout the climate system, beyond this example of stratospheric extremes."
287,aaai,2021,On Online Optimization: Dynamic Regret Analysis of Strongly Convex and Smooth Problems,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16858,"The regret bound of dynamic online learning algorithms is often expressed in terms of the variation in the function sequence ($V_T$) and/or the path-length of the minimizer sequence after $T$ rounds. For strongly convex and smooth functions, , Zhang et al. establish the squared path-length of the minimizer sequence ($C^*_{2,T}$) as a lower bound on regret. They also show that online gradient descent (OGD) achieves this lower bound using multiple gradient queries per round. In this paper, we focus on unconstrained online optimization. We first show that a preconditioned variant of OGD achieves $O(C^*_{2,T})$ with one gradient query per round. We then propose online optimistic Newton (OON) method for the case when the first and second order information of the function sequence is predictable. The regret bound of OON is captured via the quartic path-length of the minimizer sequence ($C^*_{4,T}$), which can be much smaller than $C^*_{2,T}$. We finally show that by using multiple gradients for OGD, we can achieve an upper bound of $O(\min\{C^*_{2,T},V_T\})$ on regret."
288,aaai,2021,BOSS: A Bi-directional Search Technique for Optimal Coalition Structure Generation with Minimal Overlapping (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17879,"Coalition formation is a key topic in multiagent systems. One would prefer a coalition structure that maximizes the sum of the values of the coalitions, but often the number of coalition structures is too large to allow exhaustive search for the optimal one. But then, can the coalition structure found via a partial search be guaranteed to be within a bound from optimum? We show that none of the previous coalition structure generation algorithms can establish any bound because they search fewer nodes than a threshold that we show necessary for establishing a bound. We present an algorithm that establishes a tight bound within this minimal amount of search, and show that any other algorithm would have to search strictly more. The fraction of nodes needed to be searched approaches zero as the number of agents grows. If additional time remains, our anytime algorithm searches further, and establishes a progressively lower tight bound. Surprisingly, just searching one more node drops the bound in half. As desired, our algorithm lowers the bound rapidly early on, and exhibits diminishing returns to computation. It also drastically outperforms its obvious contenders. Finally, we show how to distribute the desired search across self-interested manipulative agents."

However, results have mostly been demonstrated on imitating a single distinct motion pattern, and do not generalize to interactive tasks that require flexible motion patterns due to varying human-object spatial configurations. To bridge this gap, we focus on one class of interactive tasks -- sitting onto a chair. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework which relies on a collection of subtask controllers trained to imitate simple, reusable mocap motions, and a meta controller trained to execute the subtasks properly to complete the main task. We experimentally demonstrate the strength of our approach over different non-hierarchical and hierarchical baselines. We also show that our approach can be applied to motion prediction given an image input. A supplementary video can be found at https://youtu.be/3CeN0OGz2cA."

To this end, we consider a rarely investigated but more rigorous setting, namely hard-label attack, in which the attacker can only access the prediction label. In particular, we find we can learn the importance of different words via the change on prediction label caused by word substitutions on the adversarial examples. Based on this observation, we propose a novel adversarial attack, termed Text Hard-label attacker (TextHacker). TextHacker randomly perturbs lots of words to craft an adversarial example. Then, TextHacker adopts a hybrid local search algorithm with the estimation of word importance from the attack history to minimize the adversarial perturbation. Extensive evaluations for text classification and textual entailment show that TextHacker significantly outperforms existing hard-label attacks regarding the attack performance as well as adversary quality."

Here, we reexamine data from previous carefully designed experiments, collected at scale, that measured and catalogued these biases in aggregate form. We design deep learning models that replicate these biases in aggregate, while also capturing individual variation in behavior. A key finding of our work is that paucity of data collected from each individual subject can be overcome by sampling large numbers of subjects from the population, while still capturing individual differences. In addition, we can predict human behavior with high accuracy without making any assumptions about task goals, reward structure, or individual biases, thus providing a model-agnostic fit to human behavior in the task. Such an approach can sidestep potential limitations in modeler-specified inductive biases, and has implications for computational modeling of human cognitive function in general, and of human-AI interfaces in particular."

A submodular function is decomposable if it takes the form of a sum of submodular functions. The special case of maximizing a monotone, decomposable submodular function under cardinality constraints is known as the Combinatorial Public Projects (CPP) problem [Papadimitriou et al., 2008]. Previous work by Gupta et al. [2010] gave a differentially private algorithm for the CPP problem. We extend this work by designing differentially private algorithms for both monotone and non-monotone decomposable submodular maximization under general matroid constraints, with competitive utility guarantees. We complement our theoretical bounds with experiments demonstrating empirical performance, which improves over the differentially private algorithms for the general case of submodular maximization and is close to the performance of non-private algorithms."

However, choosing the right model along with good parameter values that performs well on a given data is still challenging. Automatically providing a good set of models to users for a given dataset saves both time and effort from using trial-and-error approaches with a wide variety of available models along with parameter optimization. We present AutoAI for Time Series Forecasting (AutoAI-TS) that provides users with a zero configuration (zero-conf ) system to efficiently train, optimize and choose best forecasting model among various classes of models for the given dataset. With its flexible zero-conf design, AutoAI-TS automatically performs all the data preparation, model creation, parameter optimization, training and model selection for users and provides a trained model that is ready to use. For given data, AutoAI-TS utilizes a wide variety of models including classical statistical models, Machine Learning (ML) models, statistical-ML hybrid models and deep learning models along with various transformations to create forecasting pipelines. It then evaluates and ranks pipelines using the proposed T-Daub mechanism to choose the best pipeline. The paper describe in detail all the technical aspects of AutoAI-TS along with extensive benchmarking on a variety of real world data sets for various use-cases. Benchmark results show that AutoAI-TS, with no manual configuration from the user, automatically trains and selects pipelines that on average outperform existing state-of-the-art time series forecasting toolkits."

Modern neural networks are known to suffer under this setting, as they quickly forget previously acquired knowledge. To address such catastrophic forgetting, many continual learning methods implement different types of experience replay, re-learning on past data stored in a small buffer known as episodic memory. In this work, we complement experience replay with a new objective that we call anchoring, where the learner uses bilevel optimization to update its knowledge on the current task, while keeping intact the predictions on some anchor points of past tasks. These anchor points are learned using gradient-based optimization to maximize forgetting, which is approximated by fine-tuning the currently trained model on the episodic memory of past tasks. Experiments on several supervised learning benchmarks for continual learning demonstrate that our approach improves the standard experience replay in terms of both accuracy and forgetting metrics and for various sizes of episodic memories."
295,aaai,2021,Fair and Efficient Allocations under Subadditive Valuations,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16665,"We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods among agents with subadditive valuations in a fair and efficient manner. Envy-Freeness up to any good (EFX) is the most compelling notion of fairness in the context of indivisible goods. Although the existence of EFX is not known beyond the simple case of two agents with subadditive valuations, some good approximations of EFX are known to exist, namely $\tfrac{1}{2}$-EFX allocation and EFX allocations with bounded charity.   Nash welfare (the geometric mean of agents' valuations) is one of the most commonly used measures of efficiency. In case of additive valuations, an allocation that maximizes Nash welfare also satisfies fairness properties like Envy-Free up to one good (EF1). Although there is substantial work on approximating Nash welfare when agents have additive valuations, very little is known when agents have subadditive valuations. In this paper, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs an allocation that satisfies either of the two approximations of EFX as well as achieves an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ approximation to the Nash welfare. Our result also improves the current best-known approximation of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(m)$ to Nash welfare when agents have submodular and subadditive valuations, respectively.   Furthermore, our technique also gives an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ approximation to a family of welfare measures, $p$-mean of valuations for $p\in (-\infty, 1]$, thereby also matching asymptotically the current best known approximation ratio for special cases like $p =-\infty$ while also retaining the fairness properties."

This work proposes a joint classification-and-prediction framework based on CNNs for automatic sleep staging, and, subsequently, introduces a simple yet efficient CNN architecture to power the framework. Given a single input epoch, the novel framework jointly determines its label (classification) and its neighboring epochs' labels (prediction) in the contextual output. While the proposed framework is orthogonal to the widely adopted classification schemes, which take one or multiple epochs as contextual inputs and produce a single classification decision on the target epoch, we demonstrate its advantages in several ways. First, it leverages the dependency among consecutive sleep epochs while surpassing the problems experienced with the common classification schemes. Second, even with a single model, the framework has the capacity to produce multiple decisions, which are essential in obtaining a good performance as in ensemble-of-models methods, with very little induced computational overhead. Probabilistic aggregation techniques are then proposed to leverage the availability of multiple decisions. We conducted experiments on two public datasets: Sleep-EDF Expanded with 20 subjects, and Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies dataset with 200 subjects. The proposed framework yields an overall classification accuracy of 82.3% and 83.6%, respectively. We also show that the proposed framework not only is superior to the baselines based on the common classification schemes but also outperforms existing deep-learning approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first work going beyond the standard single-output classification to consider multitask neural networks for automatic sleep staging. This framework provides avenues for further studies of different neural-network architectures for automatic sleep staging."

Given a trained deep learning model, an important natural problem is how to reliably verify the model's prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel framework -- deep verifier networks (DVN) to verify the inputs and outputs of deep discriminative models with deep generative models. Our proposed model is based on conditional variational auto-encoders with disentanglement constraints. We give both intuitive and theoretical justifications of the model. Our verifier network is trained independently with the prediction model, which eliminates the need of retraining the verifier network for a new model. We test the verifier network on out-of-distribution detection and adversarial example detection problems, as well as anomaly detection problems in structured prediction tasks such as image caption generation. We achieve state-of-the-art results in all of these problems."

We address this problem by finding a piecewise linear path for each agent such that the actual trajectories following these paths are guaranteed to satisfy the reach-and-avoid requirement. We show that the spatial tracking error of the actual trajectories of the controlled agents can be pre-computed for any qualified path that considers the minimum duration of each path segment due to actuation limits. Using these bounds, we find a collision-free path for each agent by solving Mixed Integer-Linear Programs and coordinate agents by using the priority-based search. We demonstrate our method by benchmarking in 2D and 3D scenarios with ground vehicles and quadrotors, respectively, and show improvements over the solving time and the solution quality compared to two state-of-the-art multi-agent motion planners."

However, most existing focus based depth estimation approaches depend on maximal sharpness of the focal stack. Out of focus information in the focal stack poses challenges for this task. In this paper, we propose a dynamically multi modal learning strategy which incorporates RGB data and the focal stack in our framework. Our goal is to deeply excavate the spatial correlation in the focal stack by designing the spatial correlation perception module and dynamically fuse multi modal information between RGB data and the focal stack in a adaptive way by designing the multi modal dynamic fusion module. The success of our method is demonstrated by achieving the state of the art performance on two datasets. Furthermore, we test our network on a set of different focused images generated by a smart phone camera to prove that the proposed method not only broke the limitation of only using light field data, but also open a path toward practical applications of depth estimation on common consumer level cameras data."

The lack of alignment in NMT models leads to three problems: it is hard to (1) interpret the translation process, (2) impose lexical constraints, and (3) impose structural constraints. To alleviate these problems, we propose to introduce explicit phrase alignment into the translation process of arbitrary NMT models. The key idea is to build a search space similar to that of phrase-based statistical machine translation for NMT where phrase alignment is readily available. We design a new decoding algorithm that can easily impose lexical and structural constraints. Experiments show that our approach makes the translation process of NMT more interpretable without sacrificing translation quality. In addition, our approach achieves significant improvements in lexically and structurally constrained translation tasks."

This approach implements an explicit model of the human user's problem-solving capabilities as an integral element in the overall problem solving architecture. This integrated model, represented as an influence diagram, is the basis for achieving adaptive task sharing behavior between the associate system and the human user. This associate system model has been applied toward ongoing research on a Mars Rover Manager's Associate (MRMA). MRMA's role would be to manage a small fleet of robotic rovers on the Martian surface.

The latest methods that utilize human demonstration data and unsupervised representation learning has proven to be a promising direction to improve RL learning efficiency. The use of demonstration data also allows ""warming-up"" the RL policies using offline data with imitation learning or the recently emerged offline reinforcement learning algorithms. However, existing works often treat offline policy learning and online exploration as two separate processes, which are often accompanied by severe performance drop during the offline-to-online transition. Furthermore, many robotic manipulation tasks involve complex sub-task structures, which are very challenging to be solved in RL with sparse reward. In this work, we propose a unified offline-to-online RL framework that resolves the transition performance drop issue. Additionally, we introduce goal-aware state information to the RL agent, which can greatly reduce task complexity and accelerate policy learning. Combined with an advanced unsupervised representation learning module, our framework achieves great training efficiency and performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods in multiple robotic manipulation tasks."

For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success in estimating tropical cyclone (TC) intensity based on satellite data with fixed temporal frequency (e.g., 3 h). However, to achieve more timely (under 30 min) and accurate TC intensity estimates, a deep learning model is demanded to handle temporally-heterogeneous satellite observations. Specifically, infrared (IR1) and water vapor (WV) images are available under every 15 minutes, while passive microwave rain rate (PMW) is available for about every 3 hours. Meanwhile, the visible (VIS) channel is severely affected by noise and sunlight intensity, making it difficult to be utilized. Therefore, we propose a novel framework that combines generative adversarial network (GAN) with CNN. The model utilizes all data, including VIS and PMW information, during the training phase and eventually uses only the high-frequent IR1 and WV data for providing intensity estimates during the predicting phase. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid GAN-CNN framework achieves comparable precision to the state-of-the-art models, while possessing the capability of increasing the maximum estimation frequency from 3 hours to less than 15 minutes."

In contrast, TC structure, which is conventionally described by a few parameters estimated subjectively by meteorology specialists, is still hard to be profiled objectively and routinely. This study applies CNN on satellite images to create the entire TC structure profiles, covering all the structural parameters. By utilizing the meteorological domain knowledge to construct TC wind profiles based on historical structure parameters, we provide valuable labels for training in our newly released benchmark dataset. With such a dataset, we hope to attract more attention to this crucial issue among data scientists. Meanwhile, a baseline is established with a specialized convolutional model operating on polar-coordinates. We discovered that it is more feasible and physically reasonable to extract structural information on polar-coordinates, instead of Cartesian coordinates, according to a TC's rotational and spiral natures. Experimental results on the released benchmark dataset verified the robustness of the proposed model and demonstrated the potential for applying deep learning techniques for this barely developed yet important topic."

Given a set of weighted elements and a set of items with nonnegative values, where each item covers several distinct elements, these two problems both aim to find a subset of items that maximizes an objective function while satisfying a knapsack capacity (budget) constraint. We propose an efficient and effective local search algorithm called E2LS for these two problems. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an algorithm has been proposed for both of them. E2LS trade-offs the search region and search efficiency by applying a proposed novel operator ADD$^*$ to traverse the refined search region. Such a trade-off mechanism allows E2LS to explore the solution space widely and quickly. The tabu search method is also applied in E2LS to help the algorithm escape from local optima. Extensive experiments on a total of 168 public instances with various scales demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm for both the SUKP and BMCP."

Here, the goal is to assign objects (load) to servers (computing nodes) in a way that provides load balancing while at the same time dynamically adjusts to the addition or removal of servers. One essential requirement is that the addition or removal of small servers should not require us to recompute the complete assignment. A popular and widely adopted solution is the two-decade-old Consistent Hashing (CH). Recently, an elegant extension was provided to account for server bounds. In this paper, we identify that existing methodologies for CH and its variants suffer from cascaded overflow, leading to poor load balancing. This cascading effect leads to decreasing performance of the hashing procedure with increasing load. To overcome the cascading effect, we propose a simple solution to CH based on recent advances in fast minwise hashing. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that our proposed solution is significantly superior for load balancing and is optimal in many senses. On the AOL search dataset and Indiana University Clicks dataset with real user activity, our proposed solution reduces cache misses by several magnitudes."

However, it is essential to fully grasp the dialog context to generate a reasonable response. Hence, in this paper, we propose to improve the response generation performance by examining the model's ability to answer a reading comprehension question, where the question is focused on the omitted information in the dialog. Enlightened by the multi-task learning scheme, we propose a joint framework that unifies these two tasks, sharing the same encoder to extract the common and task-invariant features with different decoders to learn task-specific features. To better fusing information from the question and the dialog history in the encoding part, we propose to augment the Transformer architecture with a memory updater, which is designed to selectively store and update the history dialog information so as to support downstream tasks. For the experiment, we employ human annotators to write and examine a large-scale dialog reading comprehension dataset. Extensive experiments are conducted on this dataset, and the results show that the proposed model brings substantial improvements over several strong baselines on both tasks. In this way, we demonstrate that reasoning can indeed help better response generation and vice versa. We release our large-scale dataset for further research."

However, existing DG approaches are usually disturbed by serious domain variations due to significant dataset variations. Subsequently, DG highly relies on designing domain-invariant features, which is however not well exploited, since most existing approaches directly mix multiple datasets to train DG based models without considering the local dataset similarities, i.e., examples that are very similar but from different domains. In this paper, we present a Dual Distribution Alignment Network (DDAN), which handles this challenge by mapping images into a domain-invariant feature space by selectively aligning distributions of multiple source domains. Such an alignment is conducted by dual-level constraints, i.e., the domain-wise adversarial feature learning and the identity-wise similarity enhancement. We evaluate our DDAN on a large-scale Domain Generalization Re-ID (DG Re-ID) benchmark. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed DDAN can well align the distributions of various source domains, and significantly outperforms all existing domain generalization approaches."

This is an important set-up due to the combinatorial nature of visual relations : collecting sufficient training data for all possible triplets would be very hard. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we learn a representation of visual relations that combines (i) individual embeddings for subject, object and predicate together with (ii) a visual phrase embedding that represents the relation triplet. Second, we learn how to transfer visual phrase embeddings from existing training triplets to unseen test triplets using analogies between relations that involve similar objects. Third, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach on three challenging datasets : on HICO-DET, our model achieves significant improvement over a strong baseline for both frequent and unseen triplets, and we observe similar improvement for the retrieval of unseen triplets with out-of-vocabulary predicates on the COCO-a dataset as well as the challenging unusual triplets in the UnRel dataset."

In this paper, we analyze the weakness of object trackers based on the Siamese network and then extend adversarial examples to visual object tracking. We present an end-to-end network FAN (Fast Attack Network) that uses a novel drift loss combined with the embedded feature loss to attack the Siamese network based trackers. Under a single GPU, FAN is efficient in the training speed and has a strong attack performance. The FAN can generate an adversarial example at 10ms, achieve effective targeted attack (at least 40% drop rate on OTB) and untargeted attack (at least 70% drop rate on OTB)."

Adaptation is done on a per-task basis, and retraining is needed when the system configuration changes. The resulting inefficiency in terms of data and training time requirements can be mitigated, if domain knowledge is available, by selecting a suitable model class and learning procedure, collectively known as inductive bias. However, it is generally difficult to encode prior knowledge into an inductive bias, particularly with black-box model classes such as neural networks. Meta-learning provides a way to automatize the selection of an inductive bias. Meta-learning leverages data or active observations from tasks that are expected to be related to future, and a priori unknown, tasks of interest. With a meta-trained inductive bias, training of a machine learning model can be potentially carried out with reduced training data and/or time complexity.

Ad creatives with enjoyable visual appearance may increase the click-through rate (CTR) of products. Ad creatives are typically handcrafted by advertisers and then delivered to the advertising platforms for advertisement. In recent years, advertising platforms are capable of instantly compositing ad creatives with arbitrarily designated elements of each ingredient, so advertisers are only required to provide basic materials. While facilitating the advertisers, a great number of potential ad creatives can be composited, making it difficult to accurately estimate CTR for them given limited real-time feedback. To this end, we propose an Adaptive and Efficient ad creative Selection (AES) framework based on a tree structure. The tree structure on compositing ingredients enables dynamic programming for efficient ad creative selection on the basis of CTR. Due to limited feedback, the CTR estimator is usually of high variance. Exploration techniques based on Thompson sampling are widely used for reducing variances of the CTR estimator, alleviating feedback sparsity. Based on the tree structure, Thompson sampling is adapted with dynamic programming, leading to efficient exploration for potential ad creatives with the largest CTR. We finally evaluate the proposed algorithm on the synthetic dataset and the real-world dataset. The results show that our approach can outperform competing baselines in terms of convergence rate and overall CTR."

However the computation of Fisher information matrix becomes more and more difficult as the network structure turns large and complex. This paper proposes a new optimization method whose main idea is to accurately replace the natural gradient optimization by reconstructing the network. More specifically, we reconstruct the structure of the deep neural network, and optimize the new network using traditional gradient descent (GD). The reconstructed network achieves the effect of the optimization way with natural gradient descent. Experimental results show that our optimization method can accelerate the convergence of deep network models and achieve better performance than GD while sharing its computational simplicity."

To address such situations recent work describes k-Robust Conflict-BasedSearch (k-CBS): an algorithm that produces coordinated and collision-free plan that is robust for up to k delays. In this work we introducing a variety of pairwise symmetry breaking constraints, specific to k-robust planning, that can efficiently find compatible and optimal paths for pairs of conflicting agents. We give a thorough description of the new constraints and report large improvements to success rate ina range of domains including: (i) classic MAPF benchmarks;(ii) automated warehouse domains and; (iii) on maps from the 2019 Flatland Challenge, a recently introduced railway domain where k-robust planning can be fruitfully applied to schedule trains."
316,aaai,2021,RSPNet: Relative Speed Perception for Unsupervised Video Representation Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16189,"We study unsupervised video representation learning that seeks to learn both motion and appearance features from unlabeled video only, which can be reused for downstream tasks such as action recognition. This task, however, is extremely challenging due to 1) the highly complex spatial-temporal information in videos; and 2) the lack of labeled data for training. Unlike the representation learning for static images, it is difficult to construct a suitable self-supervised task to well model both motion and appearance features. More recently, several attempts have been made to learn video representation through video playback speed prediction. However, it is non-trivial to obtain precise speed labels for the videos. More critically, the learnt models may tend to focus on motion pattern and thus may not learn appearance features well. In this paper, we observe that the relative playback speed is more consistent with motion pattern, and thus provide more effective and stable supervision for representation learning. Therefore, we propose a new way to perceive the playback speed and exploit the relative speed between two video clips as labels. In this way, we are able to well perceive speed and learn better motion features. Moreover, to ensure the learning of appearance features, we further propose an appearance-focused task, where we enforce the model to perceive the appearance difference between two video clips. We show that optimizing the two tasks jointly consistently improves the performance on two downstream tasks, namely action recognition and video retrieval. Remarkably, for action recognition on UCF101 dataset, we achieve 93.7% accuracy without the use of labeled data for pre-training, which outperforms the ImageNet supervised pre-trained model. Code and pre-trained models can be found at https://github.com/PeihaoChen/RSPNet."

They correspond to the attractors of the most permissive mode. Due to their versatility, the computation of MTSs has recently gained traction, essentially by focusing on their enumeration. In this paper, we address the logical reasoning on universal properties of MTSs in the scope of two problems: the reprogramming of Boolean networks for identifying the permanent freeze of Boolean variables that enforce a given property on all the MTSs, and the synthesis of Boolean networks from universal properties on their MTSs. Both problems reduce to solving the satisfiability of quantified propositional logic formula with 3 levels of quantifiers ($\exists\forall\exists$). In this paper, we introduce a Counter-Example Guided Refinement Abstraction (CEGAR) to efficiently solve these problems by coupling the resolution of two simpler formulas. We provide a prototype relying on Answer-Set Programming for each formula and show its tractability on a wide range of Boolean models of biological networks."

In this work we aim at increasing the diversity of the generated stories while preserving the informative content from the images. We propose to foster the diversity and informativeness of a generated story by using a concept selection module that suggests a set of concept candidates. Then, we utilize a large scale pre-trained model to convert concepts and images into full stories. To enrich the candidate concepts, a commonsense knowledge graph is created for each image sequence from which the concept candidates are proposed. To obtain appropriate concepts from the graph, we propose two novel modules that consider the correlation among candidate concepts and the image-concept correlation. Extensive automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that our model can produce reasonable concepts. This enables our model to outperform the previous models by a large margin on the diversity and informativeness of the story, while retaining the relevance of the story to the image sequence."

Existing models of inductive reasoning mainly focus on predicting missing links by learning logical rules. However, many existing approaches do not take into account semantic correlations between relations, which are commonly seen in real-world knowledge graphs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel inductive reasoning approach, namely TACT, which can effectively exploit Topology-Aware CorrelaTions between relations in an entity-independent manner. TACT is inspired by the observation that the semantic correlation between two relations is highly correlated to their topological structure in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we categorize all relation pairs into several topological patterns, and then propose a Relational Correlation Network (RCN) to learn the importance of the different patterns for inductive link prediction. Experiments demonstrate that TACT can effectively model semantic correlations between relations, and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for the inductive link prediction task."

Speaker verification is done by the use of some parameters (features) from the speakers voice which can be used to differentiate among many speakers. The efficiency of speaker verification system mainly depends on the feature set providing high inter-speaker variability and low intra-speaker variability. There are many methods used for speaker verification. Some systems use Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as features (MFCCs), while others use Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based speaker recognition, Support Vector Machines (SVM), GMMs . In this paper simple intra-pitch temporal information in conjunction with pitch synchronous cepstral coefficients forms the feature set. The distinct feature of a speaker is determined from the steady state part of five cardinal spoken English vowels. The performance was found to be average when these features were used independently. But very encouraging results were observed when both features were combined to form a decision for speaker verification. For a database of twenty speakers of 100 utterances per speaker, an accuracy of 91.04% has been observed. The analysis of speakers whose recognition was incorrect is conducted and discussed ."

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Text-Video Retrieval,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16192,"Domain adaptive image retrieval includes single-domain retrieval and cross-domain retrieval. Most of the existing image retrieval methods only focus on single-domain retrieval, which assumes that the distributions of retrieval databases and queries are similar. However, in practical application, the discrepancies between retrieval databases often taken in ideal illumination/pose/background/camera conditions and queries usually obtained in uncontrolled conditions are very large. In this paper, considering the practical application, we focus on challenging cross-domain retrieval. To address the problem, we propose an effective method named Probability Weighted Compact Feature Learning (PWCF), which provides inter-domain correlation guidance to promote cross-domain retrieval accuracy and learns a series of compact binary codes to improve the retrieval speed. First, we derive our loss function through the Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP): Bayesian Perspective (BP) induced focal-triplet loss, BP induced quantization loss and BP induced classification loss. Second, we propose a common manifold structure between domains to explore the potential correlation across domains. Considering the original feature representation is biased due to the inter-domain discrepancy, the manifold structure is difficult to be constructed. Therefore, we propose a new feature named Histogram Feature of Neighbors (HFON) from the sample statistics perspective. Extensive experiments on various benchmark databases validate that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art image retrieval methods for domain adaptive image retrieval.

However, the DR methods face many challenges due to limited training samples with high dimensional spectra. To address this issue, a graph-based spatial and spectral regularized local scaling cut (SSRLSC) for DR of HSI data is proposed. The underlying idea of the proposed method is to utilize the information from both the spectral and spatial domains to achieve better classification accuracy than its spectral domain counterpart. In SSRLSC, a guided filter is initially used to smoothen and homogenize the pixels of the HSI data in order to preserve the pixel consistency. This is followed by generation of between-class and within-class dissimilarity matrices in both spectral and spatial domains by regularized local scaling cut (RLSC) and neighboring pixel local scaling cut (NPLSC) respectively. Finally, we obtain the projection matrix by optimizing the updated spatial-spectral between-class and total-class dissimilarity. The effectiveness of the proposed DR algorithm is illustrated with two popular real-world HSI datasets."

In mutual learning, students learn from each other and the generalization error is improved even if the teacher has not taken part in the mutual learning. However, in the case of different initial overlaps(direction cosine) between teacher and students, a student with a larger initial overlap tends to have a larger generalization error than that of before the mutual learning. To overcome this problem, our proposed optimization method of mutual learning optimizes the step sizes of two students to minimize the asymptotic property of the generalization error. Consequently, the optimized mutual learning converges to a generalization error identical to that of the optimal ensemble learning. In addition, we show the relationship between the optimum step size of the mutual learning and the integration mechanism of the ensemble learning."

The scheme contains truncation, dithering, and quantization as typical steps. As canonical examples, the quantization scheme is applied to the estimation problems of sparse covariance matrix estimation, sparse linear regression (i.e., compressed sensing), and matrix completion. We study both sub-Gaussian and heavy-tailed regimes, where the underlying distribution of heavy-tailed data is assumed to have bounded moments of some order. We propose new estimators based on 1-bit quantized data. In sub-Gaussian regime, our estimators achieve near minimax rates, indicating that our quantization scheme costs very little. In heavy-tailed regime, while the rates of our estimators become essentially slower, these results are either the first ones in an 1-bit quantized and heavy-tailed setting, or already improve on existing comparable results from some respect. Under the observations in our setting, the rates are almost tight in compressed sensing and matrix completion. Our 1-bit compressed sensing results feature general sensing vector that is sub-Gaussian or even heavy-tailed. We also first investigate a novel setting where both the covariate and response are quantized. In addition, our approach to 1-bit matrix completion does not rely on likelihood and represent the first method robust to pre-quantization noise with unknown distribution. Experimental results on synthetic data are presented to support our theoretical analysis."

As the graph convolution is a local operation, it can only utilize the short-range joint dependencies and short-term trajectory but fails to directly model the distant joints relations and long-range temporal information that are vital to distinguishing various actions. To solve this problem, we present a multi-scale spatial graph convolution (MS-GC) module and a multi-scale temporal graph convolution (MT-GC) module to enrich the receptive field of the model in spatial and temporal dimensions. Concretely, the MS-GC and MT-GC modules decompose the corresponding local graph convolution into a set of sub-graph convolution, forming a hierarchical residual architecture. Without introducing additional parameters, the features will be processed with a series of sub-graph convolutions, and each node could complete multiple spatial and temporal aggregations with its neighborhoods. The final equivalent receptive field is accordingly enlarged, which is capable of capturing both short- and long-range dependencies in spatial and temporal domains. By coupling these two modules as a basic block, we further propose a multi-scale spatial temporal graph convolutional network (MST-GCN), which stacks multiple blocks to learn effective motion representations for action recognition. The proposed MST-GCN achieves remarkable performance on three challenging benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D, NTU-120 RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton, for skeleton-based action recognition."

In this paper, we propose Hypergradient Data Relevance Analysis, or HYDRA, which interprets the predictions made by DNNs as effects of their training data. Existing approaches generally estimate data contributions around the final model parameters and ignore how the training data shape the optimization trajectory. By unrolling the hypergradient of test loss w.r.t. the weights of training data, HYDRA assesses the contribution of training data toward test data points throughout the training trajectory. In order to accelerate computation, we remove the Hessian from the calculation and prove that, under moderate conditions, the approximation error is bounded. Corroborating this theoretical claim, empirical results indicate the error is indeed small. In addition, we quantitatively demonstrate that HYDRA outperforms influence functions in accurately estimating data contribution and detecting noisy data labels.

We further propose a novel iterative method for searching for a hidden graph structure that augments the initial graph structure. Our iterative method dynamically stops when the learned graph structure approaches close enough to the optimal graph. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DIAL-GNN model can consistently outperform or match state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both downstream task performance and computational time. The proposed approach can cope with both transductive learning and inductive learning."

However, most existing RGB-D SOD models conduct feature fusion either in the single encoder or the decoder stage, which hardly guarantees sufficient cross-modal fusion ability. In this paper, we make the first attempt in addressing RGB-D SOD through 3D convolutional neural networks. The proposed model, named RD3D, aims at pre-fusion in the encoder stage and in-depth fusion in the decoder stage to effectively promote the full integration of RGB and depth streams. Specifically, RD3D first conducts pre-fusion across RGB and depth modalities through an inflated 3D encoder, and later provides in-depth feature fusion by designing a 3D decoder equipped with rich back-projection paths (RBPP) for leveraging the extensive aggregation ability of 3D convolutions. With such a progressive fusion strategy involving both the encoder and decoder, effective and thorough interaction between the two modalities can be exploited and boost the detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on six widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that RD3D performs favorably against 14 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD approaches in terms of four key evaluation metrics.

This is at least in part due to our inability to perfectly calibrate the coordinate frames of today's high degree of freedom robot arms that link the head to the end-effectors. We present a novel framework combining pre-touch sensing and deep learning to more accurately estimate pose in an efficient manner. The use of pre-touch sensing allows our method to localize the object directly with respect to the robot's end effector, thereby avoiding error caused by miscalibration of the arms. Instead of requiring the robot to scan the entire object with its pre-touch sensor, we use a deep neural network to detect object regions that contain distinctive geometric features. By focusing pre-touch sensing on these regions, the robot can more efficiently gather the information necessary to adjust its original pose estimate. Our region detection network was trained using a new dataset containing objects of widely varying geometries and has been labeled in a scalable fashion that is free from human bias. This dataset is applicable to any task that involves a pre-touch sensor gathering geometric information, and has been made publicly available. We evaluate our framework by having the robot re-estimate the pose of a number of objects of varying geometries. Compared to two simpler region proposal methods, we find that our deep neural network performs significantly better. In addition, we find that after a sequence of scans, objects can typically be localized to within 0.5 cm of their true position. We also observe that the original pose estimate can often be significantly improved after collecting a single quick scan."

For example, the grounding process is usually a trivial language-location association without visual reasoning, e.g., grounding any language query containing sheep to the nearly central regions, due to that most queries about sheep have ground-truth locations at the image center. First, we frame the visual grounding pipeline into a causal graph, which shows the causalities among image, query, target location and underlying confounder. Through the causal graph, we know how to break the grounding bottleneck: deconfounded visual grounding. Second, to tackle the challenge that the confounder is unobserved in general, we propose a confounder-agnostic approach called: Referring Expression Deconfounder (RED), to remove the confounding bias. Third, we implement RED as a simple language attention, which can be applied in any grounding method. On popular benchmarks, RED improves various state-of-the-art grounding methods by a significant margin. Code will soon be available at: https://github.com/JianqiangH/Deconfounded_VG."

Recently, feature-map based variants explore knowledge transfer between manually assigned teacher-student pairs in intermediate layers for further improvement. However, layer semantics may vary in different neural networks and semantic mismatch in manual layer associations will lead to performance degeneration due to negative regularization. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Calibration for cross-layer Knowledge Distillation (SemCKD), which automatically assigns proper target layers of the teacher model for each student layer with an attention mechanism. With a learned attention distribution, each student layer distills knowledge contained in multiple teacher layers rather than a specific intermediate layer for appropriate cross-layer supervision. We further provide theoretical analysis of the association weights and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

To solve these two problems, this study propose a gradient-matrix singularity analysis-based method to estimate the maximum network redundancy. Guided by that maximum rate, a novel and efficient hierarchical network pruning algorithm is developed to maximally condense the neuronal network structure without sacrificing network performance. Substantial experiments are performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the new method for pruning several advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.

It is an open question how real spiking neurons produce the kind of powerful neural computation that is possible with deep artificial neural networks, using only so very few spikes to communicate. Building on recent insights in neuroscience, we present an Adapting Spiking Neural Network (ASNN) based on adaptive spiking neurons. These spiking neurons efficiently encode information in spike-trains using a form of Asynchronous Pulsed Sigma-Delta coding while homeostatically optimizing their firing rate. In the proposed paradigm of spiking neuron computation, neural adaptation is tightly coupled to synaptic plasticity, to ensure that downstream neurons can correctly decode upstream spiking neurons. We show that this type of network is inherently able to carry out asynchronous and event-driven neural computation, while performing identical to corresponding artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, we show that these adaptive spiking neurons can be drop in replacements for ReLU neurons in standard feedforward ANNs comprised of such units. We demonstrate that this can also be successfully applied to a ReLU based deep convolutional neural network for classifying the MNIST dataset. The ASNN thus outperforms current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) implementations, while responding (up to) an order of magnitude faster and using an order of magnitude fewer spikes. Additionally, in a streaming setting where frames are continuously classified, we show that the ASNN requires substantially fewer network updates as compared to the corresponding ANN."

Moreover, reopened bugs also lead to a loss of trust in the end-users regarding the quality of the software. Thus, predicting bugs that might be reopened could be extremely helpful for software developers to avoid rework. Prior studies on reopened bug prediction focus only on three open source projects (i.e., Apache, Eclipse, and OpenOffice) to generate insights. We observe that one out of the three projects (i.e., Apache) has a data leak issue -- the bug status of reopened was included as training data to predict reopened bugs. In addition, prior studies used an outdated prediction model pipeline (i.e., with old techniques for constructing a prediction model) to predict reopened bugs. Therefore, we revisit the reopened bugs study on a large scale dataset consisting of 47 projects tracked by JIRA using the modern techniques such as SMOTE, permutation importance together with 7 different machine learning models. We study the reopened bugs using a mixed methods approach (i.e., both quantitative and qualitative study). We find that: 1) After using an updated reopened bug prediction model pipeline, only 34% projects give an acceptable performance with AUC >= 0.7. 2) There are four major reasons for a bug getting reopened, that is, technical (i.e., patch/integration issues), documentation, human (i.e., due to incorrect bug assessment), and reasons not shown in the bug reports. 3) In projects with an acceptable AUC, 94% of the reopened bugs are due to patch issues (i.e., the usage of an incorrect patch) identified before bug reopening.

Here, we go beyond label noise and identify the key bottleneck of DS-MIL to be its low data utilization: as high-quality supervision being refined by MIL, MIL abandons a large amount of training instances, which leads to a low data utilization and hinders model training from having abundant supervision. In this paper, we propose collaborative adversarial training to improve the data utilization, which coordinates virtual adversarial training (VAT) and adversarial training (AT) at different levels. Specifically, since VAT is label-free, we employ the instance-level VAT to recycle instances abandoned by MIL. Besides, we deploy AT at the bag-level to unleash the full potential of the high-quality supervision got by MIL. Our proposed method brings consistent improvements (~ 5 absolute AUC score) to the previous state of the art, which verifies the importance of the data utilization issue and the effectiveness of our method."

However, these methods typically suffer from severe action oscillations in particular in discrete action setting, which means that agents select different actions within consecutive steps even though states only slightly differ. This issue is often neglected since the policy is usually evaluated by its cumulative rewards only. Action oscillation strongly affects the user experience and can even cause serious potential security menace especially in real-world domains with the main concern of safety, such as autonomous driving. To this end, we introduce Policy Inertia Controller (PIC) which serves as a generic plug-in framework to off-the-shelf DRL algorithms, to enables adaptive trade-off between the optimality and smoothness of the learned policy in a formal way. We propose Nested Policy Iteration as a general training algorithm for PIC-augmented policy which ensures monotonically non-decreasing updates under some mild conditions. Further, we derive a practical DRL algorithm, namely Nested Soft Actor-Critic. Experiments on a collection of autonomous driving tasks and several Atari games suggest that our approach demonstrates substantial oscillation reduction in comparison to a range of commonly adopted baselines with almost no performance degradation."

However, they often have hundreds of millions of parameters and require heavy computing resources, which limits their applications in resource-limited scenarios. Here, we propose a lightweight neural method for biomedical entity linking, which needs just a fraction of the parameters of a BERT model and much less computing resources. Our method uses a simple alignment layer with attention mechanisms to capture the variations between mention and entity names. Yet, we show that our model is competitive with previous work on standard evaluation benchmarks."
341,aaai,2021,Joint Demosaicking and Denoising in the Wild: The Case of Training Under Ground Truth Uncertainty,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16186,"Image demosaicking and denoising are the two key fundamental steps in digital camera pipelines, aiming to reconstruct clean color images from noisy luminance readings. In this paper, we propose and study Wild-JDD, a novel learning framework for joint demosaicking and denoising in the wild. In contrast to previous works which generally assume the ground truth of training data is a perfect reflection of the reality, we consider here the more common imperfect case of ground truth uncertainty in the wild. We first illustrate its manifestation as various kinds of artifacts including zipper effect, color moire and residual noise. Then we formulate a two-stage data degradation process to capture such ground truth uncertainty, where a conjugate prior distribution is imposed upon a base distribution. After that, we derive an evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss to train a neural network that approximates the parameters of the conjugate prior distribution conditioned on the degraded input. Finally, to further enhance the performance for out-of-distribution input, we design a simple but effective fine-tuning strategy by taking the input as a weakly informative prior. Taking into account ground truth uncertainty, Wild-JDD enjoys good interpretability during optimization. Extensive experiments validate that it outperforms state-of-the-art schemes on joint demosaicking and denoising tasks on both synthetic and realistic raw datasets."
342,aaai,2021,Spatial-temporal Causal Inference for Partial Image-to-video Adaptation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16187,"Within the field of causal inference, it is desirable to learn the structure of causal relationships holding between a system of variables from the correlations that these variables exhibit; a sub-problem of which is to certify whether or not a given causal hypothesis is compatible with the observed correlations. A particularly challenging setting for assessing causal compatibility is in the presence of partial information; i.e. when some of the variables are hidden/latent. This paper introduces the possible worlds framework as a method for deciding causal compatibility in this difficult setting. We define a graphical object called a possible worlds diagram, which compactly depicts the set of all possible observations. From this construction, we demonstrate explicitly, using several examples, how to prove causal incompatibility. In fact, we use these constructions to prove causal incompatibility where no other techniques have been able to. Moreover, we prove that the possible worlds framework can be adapted to provide a complete solution to the possibilistic causal compatibility problem. Even more, we also discuss how to exploit graphical symmetries and cross-world consistency constraints in order to implement a hierarchy of necessary compatibility tests that we prove converges to sufficiency."
343,aaai,2021,Deductive Learning for Weakly-Supervised 3D Human Pose Estimation via Uncalibrated Cameras,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16194,"3D human pose estimation has been a long-standing challenge in computer vision and graphics, where multi-view methods have significantly progressed but are limited by the tedious calibration processes. Existing multi-view methods are restricted to fixed camera pose and therefore lack generalization ability. This paper presents a novel Probabilistic Triangulation module that can be embedded in a calibrated 3D human pose estimation method, generalizing it to uncalibration scenes. The key idea is to use a probability distribution to model the camera pose and iteratively update the distribution from 2D features instead of using camera pose. Specifically, We maintain a camera pose distribution and then iteratively update this distribution by computing the posterior probability of the camera pose through Monte Carlo sampling. This way, the gradients can be directly back-propagated from the 3D pose estimation to the 2D heatmap, enabling end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and CMU Panoptic demonstrate that our method outperforms other uncalibration methods and achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art calibration methods. Thus, our method achieves a trade-off between estimation accuracy and generalizability. Our code is in https://github.com/bymaths/probabilistic_triangulation"
344,aaai,2021,Neural Relational Inference with Efficient Message Passing Mechanisms,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16868,"Many complex processes can be viewed as dynamical systems of interacting agents. In many cases, only the state sequences of individual agents are observed, while the interacting relations and the dynamical rules are unknown. The neural relational inference (NRI) model adopts graph neural networks that pass messages over a latent graph to jointly learn the relations and the dynamics based on the observed data. However, NRI infers the relations independently and suffers from error accumulation in multi-step prediction at dynamics learning procedure. Besides, relation reconstruction without prior knowledge becomes more difficult in more complex systems. This paper introduces efficient message passing mechanisms to the graph neural networks with structural prior knowledge to address these problems. A relation interaction mechanism is proposed to capture the coexistence of all relations, and a spatio-temporal message passing mechanism is proposed to use historical information to alleviate error accumulation. Additionally, the structural prior knowledge, symmetry as a special case, is introduced for better relation prediction in more complex systems. The experimental results on simulated physics systems show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."
345,aaai,2021,Bidirectional Machine Reading Comprehension for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17500,"Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE), which aims to identify aspects from review sentences along with their corresponding opinion expressions and sentiments, is an emerging task in fine-grained opinion mining. Since ASTE consists of multiple subtasks, including opinion entity extraction, relation detection, and sentiment classification, it is critical and challenging to appropriately capture and utilize the associations among them. In this paper, we transform ASTE task into a multi-turn machine reading comprehension (MTMRC) task and propose a bidirectional MRC (BMRC) framework to address this challenge. Specifically, we devise three types of queries, including non-restrictive extraction queries, restrictive extraction queries and sentiment classification queries, to build the associations among different subtasks. Furthermore, considering that an aspect sentiment triplet can derive from either an aspect or an opinion expression, we design a bidirectional MRC structure. One direction sequentially recognizes aspects, opinion expressions, and sentiments to obtain triplets, while the other direction identifies opinion expressions first, then aspects, and at last sentiments. By making the two directions complement each other, our framework can identify triplets more comprehensively. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that BMRC achieves state-of-the-art performances."

Feature rankings may be distorted by influential points (IP), but such effects are rarely mentioned in previous studies. This study aimed to investigate the impact of IPs on feature rankings and propose a new method to detect IPs. Method The present study utilized a case-deletion (i.e., leave-one-out) approach to assess the impact of cases. The influence of a case was measured by comparing the rank changes before and after the deletion of that case. We proposed a rank comparison method using adaptive top-prioritized weights that highlighted the rank changes of the top-ranked features. The weights were adjustable to the distribution of rank changes. Results Potential IPs could be observed in several datasets. The presence of IPs could significantly alter the results of the following analysis (e.g., enriched pathways), suggesting the necessity of IPs detection when deriving feature rankings. Compared with existing methods, the novel rank comparison method could identify rank changes of important (top-ranked) features because of employing the adaptive weights adjusted to the distribution of rank changes. Conclusions IPs detection should be routinely performed when deriving feature rankings. The new method for IPs detection exhibited favorable features compared with existing methods."

However, in a recommender system, the correlations among the involved tasks are complex. Therefore, the existing MTL models designed for RS suffer from negative transfer to different degrees, which will injure optimization in MTL. We find that the root cause of negative transfer is feature redundancy that features learned for different tasks interfere with each other. To alleviate the issue of negative transfer, we propose a novel multi-task learning method termed Feature Decomposition Network (FDN). The key idea of the proposed FDN is reducing the phenomenon of feature redundancy by explicitly decomposing features into task-specific features and task-shared features with carefully designed constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two datasets, a synthetic dataset and a public datasets (i.e., Ali-CCP). Experimental results show that our proposed FDN can outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a noticeable margin."

Despite its importance, computational modeling of persuasion is still in its infancy, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets that can provide quantitative labels of persuasive strategies to expedite this line of research. To this end, we introduce a large-scale multi-domain text corpus for modeling persuasive strategies in good-faith text requests. Moreover, we design a hierarchical weakly-supervised latent variable model that can leverage partially labeled data to predict such associated persuasive strategies for each sentence, where the supervision comes from both the overall document-level labels and very limited sentence-level labels. Experimental results showed that our proposed method outperformed existing semi-supervised baselines significantly.

Previous methods mainly rely on prior expert knowledge to capture specific forgery clues, such as noise patterns, blending boundaries, and frequency artifacts. However, these methods tend to get trapped in local optima, resulting in limited robustness and generalization capability. To address these issues, we propose a novel Critical Forgery Mining (CFM) framework, which can be flexibly assembled with various backbones to boost their generalization and robustness performance. Specifically, we first build a fine-grained triplet and suppress specific forgery traces through prior knowledge-agnostic data augmentation. Subsequently, we propose a fine-grained relation learning prototype to mine critical information in forgeries through instance and local similarity-aware losses. Moreover, we design a novel progressive learning controller to guide the model to focus on principal feature components, enabling it to learn critical forgery features in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art forgery detection performance under various challenging evaluation settings."

In this work, we present a theoretical hypothesis testing and prove that noise in real-world dataset is unlikely to be CCN, which confirms that label noise should depend on the instance and justifies the urgent need to go beyond the CCN assumption.The theoretical results motivate us to study the more general and practical-relevant instance-dependent noise (IDN). To stimulate the development of theory and methodology on IDN, we formalize an algorithm to generate controllable IDN and present both theoretical and empirical evidence to show that IDN is semantically meaningful and challenging. As a primary attempt to combat IDN, we present a tiny algorithm termed self-evolution average label (SEAL), which not only stands out under IDN with various noise fractions, but also improves the generalization on real-world noise benchmark Clothing1M. Our code is released. Notably, our theoretical analysis in Section 2 provides rigorous motivations for studying IDN, which is an important topic that deserves more research attention in future."

We concretize this finding's inspiration in two essential aspects: training and validation, with which we address critical issues in learning with noisy labels. For training, we show that maximizing training accuracy on sufficiently many noisy samples yields an approximately optimal classifier. For validation, we prove that a noisy validation set is reliable, addressing the critical demand of model selection in scenarios like hyperparameter-tuning and early stopping. Previously, model selection using noisy validation samples has not been theoretically justified. We verify our theoretical results and additional claims with extensive experiments. We show characterizations of models trained with noisy labels, motivated by our theoretical results, and verify the utility of a noisy validation set by showing the impressive performance of a framework termed noisy best teacher and student (NTS).

352,aaai,2021,PASSLEAF: A Pool-bAsed Semi-Supervised LEArning Framework for Uncertain Knowledge Graph Embedding,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16522,"Embedding models for deterministic Knowledge Graphs (KG) have been extensively studied, with the purpose of capturing latent semantic relations between entities and incorporating the structured knowledge into machine learning. However, there are many KGs that model uncertain knowledge, which typically model the inherent uncertainty of relations facts with a confidence score, and embedding such uncertain knowledge represents an unresolved challenge. The capturing of uncertain knowledge will benefit many knowledge-driven applications such as question answering and semantic search by providing more natural characterization of the knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertain KG embedding model UKGE, which aims to preserve both structural and uncertainty information of relation facts in the embedding space. Unlike previous models that characterize relation facts with binary classification techniques, UKGE learns embeddings according to the confidence scores of uncertain relation facts. To further enhance the precision of UKGE, we also introduce probabilistic soft logic to infer confidence scores for unseen relation facts during training. We propose and evaluate two variants of UKGE based on different learning objectives. Experiments are conducted on three real-world uncertain KGs via three tasks, i.e. confidence prediction, relation fact ranking, and relation fact classification. UKGE shows effectiveness in capturing uncertain knowledge by achieving promising results on these tasks, and consistently outperforms baselines on these tasks."
353,aaai,2021,Generalizable Representation Learning for Mixture Domain Face Anti-Spoofing,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16199,"This work studies the generalization issue of face anti-spoofing (FAS) models on domain gaps, such as image resolution, blurriness and sensor variations. Most prior works regard domain-specific signals as a negative impact, and apply metric learning or adversarial losses to remove them from feature representation. Though learning a domain-invariant feature space is viable for the training data, we show that the feature shift still exists in an unseen test domain, which backfires on the generalizability of the classifier. In this work, instead of constructing a domain-invariant feature space, we encourage domain separability while aligning the live-to-spoof transition (i.e., the trajectory from live to spoof) to be the same for all domains. We formulate this FAS strategy of separability and alignment (SA-FAS) as a problem of invariant risk minimization (IRM), and learn domain-variant feature representation but domain-invariant classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SA-FAS on challenging cross-domain FAS datasets and establish state-of-the-art performance."

Given a putative correspondence set of an image pair, we propose a neural network which finds correct correspondences by a binary-class classifier and estimates relative pose through classified correspondences. First, we analyze that due to the imbalance in the number of correct and wrong correspondences, the loss function has a great impact on the classification results. Thus, we propose a new Guided Loss that can directly use evaluation criterion (Fn-measure) as guidance to dynamically adjust the objective function during training. We theoretically prove that the perfect negative correlation between the Guided Loss and Fn-measure, so that the network is always trained towards the direction of increasing Fn-measure to maximize it. We then propose a hybrid attention block to extract feature, which integrates the Bayesian attentive context normalization (BACN) and channel-wise attention (CA). BACN can mine the prior information to better exploit global context and CA can capture complex channel context to enhance the channel awareness of the network. Finally, based on our Guided Loss and hybrid attention block, a cascade network is designed to gradually optimize the result for more superior performance. Experiments have shown that our network achieves the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. Our code will be available in https://github.com/wenbingtao/GLHA."

With advanced network architectures, sequential recommender models can be stacked with many hidden layers, e.g., up to 100 layers on real-world recommendation datasets. Training such a deep network is difficult because it can be computationally very expensive and takes much longer time, especially in situations where there are tens of billions of user-item interactions. To deal with such a challenge, we present StackRec, a simple, yet very effective and efficient training framework for deep SR models by iterative layer stacking. Specifically, we first offer an important insight that hidden layers/blocks in a well-trained deep SR model have very similar distributions. Enlightened by this, we propose the stacking operation on the pre-trained layers/blocks to transfer knowledge from a shallower model to a deep model, then we perform iterative stacking so as to yield a much deeper but easier-to-train SR model. We validate the performance of StackRec by instantiating it with four state-of-the-art SR models in three practical scenarios with real-world datasets. Extensive experiments show that StackRec achieves not only comparable performance, but also substantial acceleration in training time, compared to SR models that are trained from scratch.

356,aaai,2021,Neighborhood Consensus Networks for Unsupervised Multi-view Outlier Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16873,"Unsupervised point cloud registration algorithm usually suffers from the unsatisfied registration precision in the partially overlapping problem due to the lack of effective inlier evaluation. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood consensus based reliable inlier evaluation method for robust unsupervised point cloud registration. It is expected to capture the discriminative geometric difference between the source neighborhood and the corresponding pseudo target neighborhood for effective inlier distinction. Specifically, our model consists of a matching map refinement module and an inlier evaluation module. In our matching map refinement module, we improve the point-wise matching map estimation by integrating the matching scores of neighbors into it. The aggregated neighborhood information potentially facilitates the discriminative map construction so that high-quality correspondences can be provided for generating the pseudo target point cloud. Based on the observation that the outlier has the significant structure-wise difference between its source neighborhood and corresponding pseudo target neighborhood while this difference for inlier is small, the inlier evaluation module exploits this difference to score the inlier confidence for each estimated correspondence. In particular, we construct an effective graph representation for capturing this geometric difference between the neighborhoods. Finally, with the learned correspondences and the corresponding inlier confidence, we use the weighted SVD algorithm for transformation estimation. Under the unsupervised setting, we exploit the Huber function based global alignment loss, the local neighborhood consensus loss, and spatial consistency loss for model optimization. The experimental results on extensive datasets demonstrate that our unsupervised point cloud registration method can yield comparable performance."
357,aaai,2021,An End-to-End Solution for Named Entity Recognition in eCommerce Search,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17773,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a critical step in modern search query understanding. In the domain of eCommerce, identifying the key entities, such as brand and product type, can help a search engine retrieve relevant products and therefore offer an engaging shopping experience. Recent research shows promising results on shared benchmark NER tasks using deep learning methods, but there are still unique challenges in the industry regarding domain knowledge, training data, and model production. This paper demonstrates an end-to-end solution to address these challenges. The core of our solution is a novel model training framework ""TripleLearn"" which iteratively learns from three separate training datasets, instead of one training set as is traditionally done. Using this approach, the best model lifts the F1 score from 69.5 to 93.3 on the holdout test data. In our offline experiments, TripleLearn improved the model performance compared to traditional training approaches which use a single set of training data. Moreover, in the online A/B test, we see significant improvements in user engagement and revenue conversion. The model has been live on homedepot.com for more than 9 months, boosting search conversions and revenue. Beyond our application, this TripleLearn framework, as well as the end-to-end process, is model-independent and problem-independent, so it can be generalized to more industrial applications, especially to the eCommerce industry which has similar data foundations and problems."
358,aaai,2021,Self-Progressing Robust Training,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16874,"Making neural networks robust against adversarial inputs has resulted in an arms race between new defenses and attacks. The most promising defenses, adversarially robust training and verifiably robust training, have limitations that restrict their practical applications. The adversarially robust training only makes the networks robust against a subclass of attackers and we reveal such weaknesses by developing a new attack based on interval gradients. By contrast, verifiably robust training provides protection against any L-p norm-bounded attacker but incurs orders of magnitude more computational and memory overhead than adversarially robust training.   We propose two novel techniques, stochastic robust approximation and dynamic mixed training, to drastically improve the efficiency of verifiably robust training without sacrificing verified robustness. We leverage two critical insights: (1) instead of over the entire training set, sound over-approximations over randomly subsampled training data points are sufficient for efficiently guiding the robust training process; and (2) We observe that the test accuracy and verifiable robustness often conflict after certain training epochs. Therefore, we use a dynamic loss function to adaptively balance them for each epoch.   We designed and implemented our techniques as part of MixTrain and evaluated it on six networks trained on three popular datasets including MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet-200. Our evaluations show that MixTrain can achieve up to $95.2\%$ verified robust accuracy against $L_\infty$ norm-bounded attackers while taking $15$ and $3$ times less training time than state-of-the-art verifiably robust training and adversarially robust training schemes, respectively. Furthermore, MixTrain easily scales to larger networks like the one trained on ImageNet-200, significantly outperforming the existing verifiably robust training methods."

Firstly, we build an effective backbone network to extract robust features from the raw point clouds. Secondly, to obtain more discriminative features, a point cloud feature fusion module is proposed to fuse the different layer features of the backbone network. Furthermore, a joint instance semantic segmentation module is developed to transform semantic features into instance embedding space, and then the transformed features are further fused with instance features to facilitate instance segmentation. Meanwhile, this module also aggregates instance features into semantic feature space to promote semantic segmentation. Finally, the instance predictions are generated by applying a simple mean-shift clustering on instance embeddings. As a result, we evaluate the proposed JSNet on a large-scale 3D indoor point cloud dataset S3DIS and a part dataset ShapeNet, and compare it with existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in 3D instance segmentation with a significant improvement in 3D semantic prediction and our method is also beneficial for part segmentation.

Recent financial studies show that the momentum spillover effect plays a significant role in stock fluctuation. However, previous studies typically only learn the simple connection information among related companies, which inevitably fail to model complex relations of listed companies in the real financial market. To address this issue, we first construct a more comprehensive Market Knowledge Graph (MKG) which contains bi-typed entities including listed companies and their associated executives, and hybrid-relations including the explicit relations and implicit relations. Afterward, we propose DanSmp, a novel Dual Attention Networks to learn the momentum spillover signals based upon the constructed MKG for stock prediction. The empirical experiments on our constructed datasets against nine SOTA baselines demonstrate that the proposed DanSmp is capable of improving stock prediction with the constructed MKG."

Inspired by recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for language generation tasks, we propose ANTOR, a method for Adaptive Natural language generation for Task-Oriented dialogue via Reinforcement learning. In ANTOR, a natural language understanding (NLU) module, which corresponds to the user's understanding of system utterances, is incorporated into the objective function of RL. If the NLG's intentions are correctly conveyed to the NLU, which understands a system's utterances, the NLG is given a positive reward. We conducted experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, and we confirmed that ANTOR could generate adaptive utterances against speech recognition errors and the different vocabulary levels of users."

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework integrating graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to robustly estimate camera-centric multi-person 3D poses that do not require camera parameters. In particular, we introduce a human-joint GCN, which, unlike the existing GCN, is based on a directed graph that employs the 2D pose estimator's confidence scores to improve the pose estimation results. We also introduce a human-bone GCN, which models the bone connections and provides more information beyond human joints. The two GCNs work together to estimate the spatial frame-wise 3D poses and can make use of both visible joint and bone information in the target frame to estimate the occluded or missing human-part information. To further refine the 3D pose estimation, we use our temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to enforce the temporal and human-dynamics constraints. We use a joint-TCN to estimate person-centric 3D poses across frames, and propose a velocity-TCN to estimate the speed of 3D joints to ensure the consistency of the 3D pose estimation in consecutive frames. Finally, to estimate the 3D human poses for multiple persons, we propose a root-TCN that estimates camera-centric 3D poses without requiring camera parameters. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Estimator-based NAS has been proposed recently to model the relationship between architectures and their performance to enable scalable and flexible search. However, existing estimator-based methods encode the architecture into a latent space without considering graph similarity. Ignoring graph similarity in node-based search space may induce a large inconsistency between similar graphs and their distance in the continuous encoding space, leading to inaccurate encoding representation and/or reduced representation capacity that can yield sub-optimal search results. To preserve graph correlation information in encoding, we propose NASGEM which stands for Neural Architecture Search via Graph Embedding Method. NASGEM is driven by a novel graph embedding method equipped with similarity measures to capture the graph topology information. By precisely estimating the graph distance and using an auxiliary Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel to guide the encoding, NASGEM can utilize additional structural information to get more accurate graph representation to improve the search efficiency. GEMNet, a set of networks discovered by NASGEM, consistently outperforms networks crafted by existing search methods in classification tasks, i.e., with 0.4%-3.6% higher accuracy while having 11%- 21% fewer Multiply-Accumulates. We further transfer GEMNet for COCO object detection. In both one-stage and twostage detectors, our GEMNet surpasses its manually-crafted and automatically-searched counterparts."

Most identifiability results and learning algorithms assume the underlying dynamics to be discrete in time. Comparatively few, in contrast, explicitly define dependencies in infinitesimal intervals of time, independently of the scale of observation and of the regularity of sampling. In this paper, we consider score-based structure learning for the study of dynamical systems. We prove that for vector fields parameterized in a large class of neural networks, least squares optimization with adaptive regularization schemes consistently recovers directed graphs of local independencies in systems of stochastic differential equations. Using this insight, we propose a score-based learning algorithm based on penalized Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (modelling the mean process) that we show to be applicable to the general setting of irregularly-sampled multivariate time series and to outperform the state of the art across a range of dynamical systems."

Despite early success, we find that developers' intent to write smart contracts is a more noteworthy security concern because smart contracts with malicious intent have caused significant users' financial loss. Unfortunately, current approaches to identify the aforementioned malicious smart contracts rely on smart contract security audits, which entail huge manpower consumption and financial expenditure. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach, SmartIntentNN, to conduct automated smart contract intent detection. SmartIntentNN consists of three primary parts: a pre-trained sentence encoder to generate the contextual representations of smart contracts, a K-means clustering method to highlight intent-related representations, and a bidirectional LSTM-based (long-short term memory) multi-label classification network to predict the intents in smart contracts. To evaluate the performance of SmartIntentNN, we collect more than 40,000 real smart contracts and perform a series of comparison experiments with our selected baseline approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that SmartIntentNN outperforms all baselines by up to 0.8212 in terms of the f1-score metric."

This is often challenging as the labels in the data are biased. This paper studies learning fair probability distributions from biased data by explicitly modeling a latent variable that represents a hidden, unbiased label. In particular, we aim to achieve demographic parity by enforcing certain independencies in the learned model. We also show that group fairness guarantees are meaningful only if the distribution used to provide those guarantees indeed captures the real-world data. In order to closely model the data distribution, we employ probabilistic circuits, an expressive and tractable probabilistic model, and propose an algorithm to learn them from incomplete data. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic dataset in which observed labels indeed come from fair labels but with added bias, and demonstrate that the fair labels are successfully retrieved. Moreover, we show on real-world datasets that our approach not only is a better model than existing methods of how the data was generated but also achieves competitive accuracy."

Moreover, researches on how to evaluate the degree of video understanding based on human cognitive process have not progressed as yet. In this paper, we propose a novel video question answering (Video QA) task, DramaQA, for a comprehensive understanding of the video story. The DramaQA focuses on two perspectives: 1) Hierarchical QAs as an evaluation metric based on the cognitive developmental stages of human intelligence. 2) Character-centered video annotations to model local coherence of the story. Our dataset is built upon the TV drama ""Another Miss Oh"" and it contains 17,983 QA pairs from 23,928 various length video clips, with each QA pair belonging to one of four difficulty levels. We provide 217,308 annotated images with rich character-centered annotations, including visual bounding boxes, behaviors and emotions of main characters, and coreference resolved scripts. Additionally, we suggest Multi-level Context Matching model which hierarchically understands character-centered representations of video to answer questions. We release our dataset and model publicly for research purposes, and we expect our work to provide a new perspective on video story understanding research."

Although much attention has been paid to large and complex data sets resulting from high-throughput sequencing, advances in high-quality video recording technology have begun to generate similarly rich data sets requiring sophisticated techniques from both computer vision and time-series analysis. Moreover, just as studying gene expression patterns in one organism can reveal general principles that apply to other organisms, the study of complex social interactions in an experimentally tractable model system, such as a laboratory ant colony, can provide general principles about the dynamics of other social groups. Here, we focus on one such example from the study of reproductive regulation in small laboratory colonies of more than 50 Harpegnathos ants. These ants can be artificially induced to begin a ~20 day process of hierarchy reformation. Although the conclusion of this process is conspicuous to a human observer, it remains unclear which behaviors during the transient period are contributing to the process. To address this issue, we explore the potential application of One-class Classification (OC) to the detection of abnormal states in ant colonies for which behavioral data is only available for the normal societal conditions during training. Specifically, we build upon the Deep Support Vector Data Description (DSVDD) and introduce the Inner-Outlier Generator (IO-GEN) that synthesizes fake ""inner outlier"" observations during training that are near the center of the DSVDD data description. We show that IO-GEN increases the reliability of the final OC classifier relative to other DSVDD baselines. This method can be used to screen video frames for which additional human observation is needed."

The textual representations in English can be desirably transferred to multilingualism and support downstream multimodal tasks for different languages. Nevertheless, the principle of multilingual fairness is rarely scrutinized: do multilingual multimodal models treat languages equally? Are their performances biased towards particular languages? To answer these questions, we view language as the fairness recipient and introduce two new fairness notions, multilingual individual fairness and multilingual group fairness, for pre-trained multimodal models. Multilingual individual fairness requires that text snippets expressing similar semantics in different languages connect similarly to images, while multilingual group fairness requires equalized predictive performance across languages. We characterize the extent to which pre-trained multilingual vision-and-language representations are individually fair across languages. However, extensive experiments demonstrate that multilingual representations do not satisfy group fairness: (1) there is a severe multilingual accuracy disparity issue; (2) the errors exhibit biases across languages conditioning the group of people in the images, including race, gender and age."

Recently deep learning methods have achieved success in the classification task of ASD using fMRI data. However, due to the black-box nature of most deep learning models, it's hard to perform biomarker selection and interpret model decisions. The recently proposed invertible networks can accurately reconstruct the input from its output, and have the potential to unravel the black-box representation. Therefore, we propose a novel method to classify ASD and identify biomarkers for ASD using the connectivity matrix calculated from fMRI as the input. Specifically, with invertible networks, we explicitly determine the decision boundary and the projection of data points onto the boundary. Like linear classifiers, the difference between a point and its projection onto the decision boundary can be viewed as the explanation. We then define the importance as the explanation weighted by the gradient of prediction $w.r.t$ the input, and identify biomarkers based on this importance measure. We perform a regression task to further validate our biomarker selection: compared to using all edges in the connectivity matrix, using the top 10\% important edges we generate a lower regression error on 6 different severity scores. Our experiments show that the invertible network is both effective at ASD classification and interpretable, allowing for discovery of reliable biomarkers."

A game of influence is an infinite repeated game with incomplete information in which, at each stage of interaction, an agent can make her opinions visible (public) or invisible (private) in order to influence other agents' opinions. The influence process is mediated by a trust network, as we assume that the opinion of a given agent is only affected by the opinions of those agents that she considers trustworthy (i.e., the agents in the trust network that are directly linked to her). Each agent is endowed with a goal, expressed in a suitable temporal language inspired from linear temporal logic (LTL). We show that games of influence provide a simple abstraction to explore the effects of the trust network structure on the agents' behaviour, by considering solution concepts from game-theory such as Nash equilibrium, weak dominance and winning strategies."

However, the annotation quality of annotators varies considerably, which imposes new challenges in learning a high-quality model from the crowdsourced annotations. In this work, we provide a new perspective to decompose annotation noise into common noise and individual noise and differentiate the source of confusion based on instance difficulty and annotator expertise on a per-instance-annotator basis. We realize this new crowdsourcing model by an end-to-end learning solution with two types of noise adaptation layers: one is shared across annotators to capture their commonly shared confusions, and the other one is pertaining to each annotator to realize individual confusion. To recognize the source of noise in each annotation, we use an auxiliary network to choose the two noise adaptation layers with respect to both instances and annotators. Extensive experiments on both synthesized and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed common noise adaptation solution."

We study the problems when either of the bounds is uniform. We apply our framework to give the first constant factor approximations for LUkM and its generalization, $k$-facility location problem (LUkFL), with $\beta+1$ factor violation in upper bounds where $\beta$ is the violation of upper bounds in solutions of upper bounded $k$-median and $k$-facility location problems respectively. We also present a result on LUkC with uniform upper bounds and, its generalization, lower and (uniform) upper bounded $k$ supplier problem (LUkS). The approach also gives a result on lower and upper bounded facility location problem (LUFL), improving upon the upper bound violation of $5/2$ due to Gupta et al.   We also reduce the violation in upper bounds for a special case when the gap between the lower and upper bounds is not too small."

Most prior work on MAPF was on grids, assumed agents' actions have uniform duration, and that time is discretized into timesteps. We propose a MAPF algorithm that does not rely on these assumptions, is complete, and provides provably optimal solutions. This algorithm is based on a novel adaptation of Safe interval path planning (SIPP), a continuous time single-agent planning algorithm, and a modified version of Conflict-based search (CBS), a state of the art multi-agent pathfinding algorithm. We analyze this algorithm, discuss its pros and cons, and evaluate it experimentally on several standard benchmarks."

Upgrading the GO gradient, we present for $\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}(\boldsymbol{y})} [f(\boldsymbol{y})]$ an unbiased low-variance Hessian estimator, named GO Hessian. Considering practical implementation, we reveal that GO Hessian is easy-to-use with auto-differentiation and Hessian-vector products, enabling efficient cheap exploitation of curvature information over stochastic computation graphs. As representative examples, we present the GO Hessian for non-reparameterizable gamma and negative binomial RVs/nodes. Based on the GO Hessian, we design a new second-order method for $\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}(\boldsymbol{y})} [f(\boldsymbol{y})]$, with rigorous experiments conducted to verify its effectiveness and efficiency."

For the line, Skowron et al. (2015) describe an $O(n^2mk)$ algorithm (where $n$, $m$, $k$ are the number of voters, the number of candidates and the committee size, respectively); we show that a simple tweak improves the time complexity to $O(nmk)$. We then improve this bound for $k=\Omega(\log n)$ by reducing our problem to the $k$-link path problem for DAGs with concave Monge weights, obtaining a $nm2^{O\left(\sqrt{\log k\log\log n}\right)}$ algorithm for the general case and a nearly linear algorithm for the Borda misrepresentation function. For trees, we point out an issue with the algorithm proposed by Clearwater, Puppe and Slinko (2015), and develop a $O(nmk)$ algorithm for this case as well. For grids, we formulate a conjecture about the structure of optimal solutions, and describe a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a winning committee if this conjecture is true; we also explain how to convert this algorithm into a bicriterial approximation algorithm whose correctness does not depend on the conjecture."
378,aaai,2021,Passive learning of Timed Automata from logs (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17883,"Specification synthesis is the process of deriving a model from the input-output traces of a system. It is used extensively in test design, reverse engineering, and system identification. One type of the resulting artifact of this process for cyber-physical systems is hybrid automata. They are intuitive, precise, tool independent, and at a high level of abstraction, and can model systems with both discrete and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose a new technique for synthesizing hybrid automaton from the input-output traces of a non-linear cyber-physical system. Similarity detection in non-linear behaviors is the main challenge for extracting such models. We address this problem by utilizing the Dynamic Time Warping technique. Our approach is passive, meaning that it does not need interaction with the system during automata synthesis from the logged traces; and online, which means that each input/output trace is used only once in the procedure. In other words, each new trace can be used to improve the already synthesized automaton. We evaluated our algorithm in two industrial and simulated case studies. The accuracy of the derived automata show promising results."

Existing algorithms often start from scratch each time the system under test changes. We apply transfer learning to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning based safety validation algorithms when applied to related systems. Knowledge from previous safety validation tasks is encoded through the action value function and transferred to future tasks with a learned set of attention weights. Including a learned state and action value transformation for each source task can improve performance even when systems have substantially different failure modes. We conduct experiments on safety validation tasks in gridworld and autonomous driving scenarios. We show that transfer learning can improve the initial and final performance of validation algorithms and reduce the number of training steps.

Deep reinforcement learning has been proposed as a way to obviate the need for such heuristics, however, its deployment in automated theorem proving remains a challenge. In this paper we introduce TRAIL, a system that applies deep reinforcement learning to saturation-based theorem proving. TRAIL leverages (a) a novel neural representation of the state of a theorem prover and (b) a novel characterization of the inference selection process in terms of an attention-based action policy. We show through systematic analysis that these mechanisms allow TRAIL to significantly outperform previous reinforcement-learning-based theorem provers on two benchmark datasets for first-order logic automated theorem proving (proving around 15% more theorems)."

The importance of analogy to humans has made it an active area of research in the broader field of artificial intelligence, resulting in data-efficient models that learn and reason in human-like ways. While cognitive perspectives of analogy and deep learning have generally been studied independently of one another, the integration of the two lines of research is a promising step towards more robust and efficient learning techniques. As part of a growing body of research on such an integration, we introduce the Analogical Matching Network: a neural architecture that learns to produce analogies between structured, symbolic representations that are largely consistent with the principles of Structure-Mapping Theory."

However, going beyond embedding spaces of constant sectional curvature, while potentially more representationally powerful, proves to be challenging as one can easily lose the appeal of computationally tractable tools such as geodesic distances or Riemannian gradients. Here, we explore computationally efficient matrix manifolds, showcasing how to learn and optimize graph embeddings in these Riemannian spaces. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent improvements over Euclidean geometry while often outperforming hyperbolic and elliptical embeddings based on various metrics that capture different graph properties. Our results serve as new evidence for the benefits of non-Euclidean embeddings in machine learning pipelines."

The uncertainty takes the form of probability intervals. Such uncertain POMDPs can be used, for example, to model autonomous agents with sensors with limited accuracy, or agents undergoing a sudden component failure, or structural damage [1]. Given an uncertain POMDP representation of the autonomous agent, our goal is to propose a method for checking whether the system will satisfy an optimal performance, while not violating a safety requirement (e.g. fuel level, velocity, and etc.). To this end, we cast the POMDP problem into a switched system scenario. We then take advantage of this switched system characterization and propose a method based on barrier certificates for optimality and/or safety verification. We then show that the verification task can be carried out computationally by sum-of-squares programming. We illustrate the efficacy of our method by applying it to a Mars rover exploration example."

Logic programming and the database query language Datalog are often used as an implementation platform for logic languages. In this paper we present the exact relation between CTL and Datalog and moreover we build on this relation and known efficient algorithms for CTL to obtain efficient algorithms for fragments of stratified Datalog. The contributions of this paper are: a) We embed CTL into STD which is a proper fragment of stratified Datalog. Moreover we show that STD expresses exactly CTL -- we prove that by embedding STD into CTL. Both embeddings are linear. b) CTL can also be embedded to fragments of Datalog without negation. We define a fragment of Datalog with the successor build-in predicate that we call TDS and we embed CTL into TDS in linear time. We build on the above relations to answer open problems of stratified Datalog. We prove that query evaluation is linear and that containment and satisfiability problems are both decidable. The results presented in this paper are the first for fragments of stratified Datalog that are more general than those containing only unary EDBs.
385,aaai,2021,DeepCollaboration: Collaborative Generative and Discriminative Models for Class Incremental Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16204,"The exemplar-free class incremental learning requires classification models to learn new class knowledge incrementally without retaining any old samples. Recently, the framework based on parallel one-class classifiers (POC), which trains a one-class classifier (OCC) independently for each category, has attracted extensive attention, since it can naturally avoid catastrophic forgetting. POC, however, suffers from weak discriminability and comparability due to its independent training strategy for different OOCs. To meet this challenge, we propose a new framework, named Discriminative and Comparable One-class classifiers for Incremental Learning (DisCOIL). DisCOIL follows the basic principle of POC, but it adopts variational auto-encoders (VAE) instead of other well-established one-class classifiers (e.g. deep SVDD), because a trained VAE can not only identify the probability of an input sample belonging to a class but also generate pseudo samples of the class to assist in learning new tasks. With this advantage, DisCOIL trains a new-class VAE in contrast with the old-class VAEs, which forces the new-class VAE to reconstruct better for new-class samples but worse for the old-class pseudo samples, thus enhancing the comparability. Furthermore, DisCOIL introduces a hinge reconstruction loss to ensure the discriminability. We evaluate our method extensively on MNIST, CIFAR10, and Tiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that DisCOIL achieves state-of-the-art performance."

We focus on studying the impact of the jointly pretrained decoder, which is the main difference between Seq2Seq pretraining and previous encoder-based pretraining approaches for NMT. By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, we find that Seq2Seq pretraining is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it helps NMT models to produce more diverse translations and reduce adequacy-related translation errors. On the other hand, the discrepancies between Seq2Seq pretraining and NMT finetuning limit the translation quality (i.e., domain discrepancy) and induce the over-estimation issue (i.e., objective discrepancy). Based on these observations, we further propose simple and effective strategies, named in-domain pretraining and input adaptation to remedy the domain and objective discrepancies, respectively. Experimental results on several language pairs show that our approach can consistently improve both translation performance and model robustness upon Seq2Seq pretraining."

In this work, we propose a relational message passing method for knowledge graph completion. Different from existing embedding-based methods, relational message passing only considers edge features (i.e., relation types) without entity IDs in the knowledge graph, and passes relational messages among edges iteratively to aggregate neighborhood information. Specifically, two kinds of neighborhood topology are modeled for a given entity pair under the relational message passing framework: (1) Relational context, which captures the relation types of edges adjacent to the given entity pair; (2) Relational paths, which characterize the relative position between the given two entities in the knowledge graph. The two message passing modules are combined together for relation prediction. Experimental results on knowledge graph benchmarks as well as our newly proposed dataset show that, our method PathCon outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge graph completion methods by a large margin. PathCon is also shown applicable to inductive settings where entities are not seen in training stage, and it is able to provide interpretable explanations for the predicted results.

To find the best configuration for these hyperparameters in such a high dimensional space, with time-consuming and expensive model training / validation, is not a trivial challenge. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of hyperparameters, efficiently trading off exploration and exploitation of the hyperparameter space. In this paper, we discuss Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, including hyperparameter optimization, Bayesian optimization, and Gaussian processes. We also review BoTorch, GPyTorch and Ax, the new open-source frameworks that we use for Bayesian optimization, Gaussian process inference and adaptive experimentation, respectively. For experimentation, we apply Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, for optimizing group weights, to weighted group pooling, which couples unsupervised tiered graph autoencoders learning and supervised graph prediction learning for molecular graphs. We find that Ax, BoTorch and GPyTorch together provide a simple-to-use but powerful framework for Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, using Ax's high-level API that constructs and runs a full optimization loop and returns the best hyperparameter configuration."

A robot or other agent could leverage an understanding of such implicit human feedback to improve its task performance at no cost to the human. This approach contrasts with common agent teaching methods based on demonstrations, critiques, or other guidance that need to be attentively and intentionally provided. In this paper, we first define the general problem of learning from implicit human feedback and then propose to address this problem through a novel data-driven framework, EMPATHIC. This two-stage method consists of (1) mapping implicit human feedback to relevant task statistics such as reward, optimality, and advantage; and (2) using such a mapping to learn a task. We instantiate the first stage and three second-stage evaluations of the learned mapping. To do so, we collect a dataset of human facial reactions while participants observe an agent execute a sub-optimal policy for a prescribed training task. We train a deep neural network on this data and demonstrate its ability to (1) infer relative reward ranking of events in the training task from prerecorded human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in the training task using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a novel domain in which it evaluates robot manipulation trajectories."

Simultaneously, to increase the robustness of watermark, attacking technique, such as watermark removal, also gets the attention from the community. Previous watermark removal methods require to gain the watermark location from users or train a multi-task network to recover the background indiscriminately. However, when jointly learning, the network performs better on watermark detection than recovering the texture. Inspired by this observation and to erase the visible watermarks blindly, we propose a novel two-stage framework with a stacked attention-guided ResUNets to simulate the process of detection, removal and refinement. In the first stage, we design a multi-task network called SplitNet. It learns the basis features for three sub-tasks altogether while the task-specific features separately use multiple channel attentions. Then, with the predicted mask and coarser restored image, we design RefineNet to smooth the watermarked region with a mask-guided spatial attention. Besides network structure, the proposed algorithm also combines multiple perceptual losses for better quality both visually and numerically. We extensively evaluate our algorithm over four different datasets under various settings and the experiments show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Our main results are to derive upper bounds on several families of well-studied influence graphs, including in-arborescences, out-arborescences and bipartite graphs. Especially, we prove that the adaptivity gap for the in-arborescence is between $[\frac{e}{e-1}, \frac{2e}{e - 1}]$ and for the out-arborescence, the gap is between $[\frac{e}{e-1}, 2]$. These are the first constant upper bounds in the full-adoption feedback model. We provide several novel ideas to tackle with correlated feedback appearing in the adaptive stochastic optimization, which we believe to be of independent interests."

Much of the early work on representations for reinforcement learning focused on designing fixed-basis architectures to achieve properties thought to be desirable, such as orthogonality and sparsity. In contrast, the idea behind deep reinforcement learning methods is that the agent designer should not encode representational properties, but rather that the data stream should determine the properties of the representation -- good representations emerge under appropriate training schemes. In this paper we bring these two perspectives together, empirically investigating the properties of representations that support transfer in reinforcement learning. We introduce and measure six representational properties over more than 25 thousand agent-task settings. We consider Deep Q-learning agents with different auxiliary losses in a pixel-based navigation environment, with source and transfer tasks corresponding to different goal locations. We develop a method to better understand why some representations work better for transfer, through a systematic approach varying task similarity and measuring and correlating representation properties with transfer performance. We demonstrate the generality of the methodology by investigating representations learned by a Rainbow agent that successfully transfer across games modes in Atari 2600."

In particular, infinite-domain CSPs have been intensively used in subareas of AI such as spatio-temporal reasoning. Since constraint satisfaction is a computationally hard problem, much work has been devoted to identifying restricted problems that are efficiently solvable. One way of doing this is to restrict the interactions of variables and constraints, and a highly successful approach is to bound the treewidth of the underlying primal graph. Bodirsky & Dalmau [J. Comput. System. Sci. 79(1), 2013] and Huang et al. [Artif. Intell. 195, 2013] proved that CSP$(\Gamma)$ can be solved in $n^{f(w)}$ time (where $n$ is the size of the instance, $w$ is the treewidth of the primal graph and $f$ is a computable function) for certain classes of constraint languages $\Gamma$. We improve this bound to $f(w) \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where the function $f$ only depends on the language $\Gamma$, for CSPs whose basic relations have the patchwork property. Hence, such problems are fixed-parameter tractable and our algorithm is asymptotically faster than the previous ones. Additionally, our approach is not restricted to binary constraints, so it is applicable to a strictly larger class of problems than that of Huang et al. However, there exist natural problems that are covered by Bodirsky & Dalmau's algorithm but not by ours, and we begin investigating ways of generalising our results to larger families of languages. We also analyse our algorithm with respect to its running time and show that it is optimal (under the Exponential Time Hypothesis) for certain languages such as Allen's Interval Algebra."
394,aaai,2021,Disjunctive Temporal Problems under Structural Restrictions,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16489,"Simple temporal problems represent a powerful class of models capable of describing the temporal relations between events that arise in many real-world applications such as logistics, robot planning and management systems. The classic simple temporal problem permits each event to have only a single release and due date. In this paper, we focus on the case where events may have an arbitrarily large number of release and due dates. This type of problem, however, has been referred to by various names. In order to simplify and standardize nomenclatures, we introduce the name Simple Disjunctive Temporal Problem. We provide three mathematical models to describe this problem using constraint programming and linear programming. To efficiently solve simple disjunctive temporal problems, we design two new algorithms inspired by previous research, both of which exploit the problem's structure to significantly reduce their space complexity. Additionally, we implement algorithms from the literature and provide the first in-depth empirical study comparing methods to solve simple disjunctive temporal problems across a wide range of experiments. Our analysis and conclusions offer guidance for future researchers and practitioners when tackling similar temporal constraint problems in new applications. All results, source code and instances are made publicly available to further assist future research."

In other words, few items are frequently recommended while the majority of items do not get proportionate attention. That leads to low coverage of items in recommendation lists across users (i.e. low aggregate diversity) and unfair distribution of recommended items. In this paper, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based algorithm that works as a post-processing approach after recommendation generation for improving aggregate diversity. The algorithm iteratively finds items that are rarely recommended yet are high-quality and add them to the users' final recommendation lists. This is done by solving the maximum flow problem on the recommendation bipartite graph. While we focus on aggregate diversity and fair distribution of recommended items, the algorithm can be adapted to other recommendation scenarios using different underlying definitions of fairness. A comprehensive set of experiments on two datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art baselines show that FairMatch, while significantly improving aggregate diversity, provides comparable recommendation accuracy."
396,aaai,2021,Detection and Prediction of Nutrient Deficiency Stress using Longitudinal Aerial Imagery,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17730,"Early, precise detection of nutrient deficiency stress (NDS) has key economic as well as environmental impact; precision application of chemicals in place of blanket application reduces operational costs for the growers while reducing the amount of chemicals which may enter the environment unnecessarily. Furthermore, earlier treatment reduces the amount of loss and therefore boosts crop production during a given season. With this in mind, we collect sequences of high-resolution aerial imagery and construct semantic segmentation models to detect and predict NDS across the field. Our work sits at the intersection of agriculture, remote sensing, and modern computer vision and deep learning. First, we establish a baseline for full-field detection of NDS and quantify the impact of pretraining, backbone architecture, input representation, and sampling strategy. We then quantify the amount of information available at different points in the season by building a single-timestamp model based on a UNet. Next, we construct our proposed spatiotemporal architecture, which combines a UNet with a convolutional LSTM layer, to accurately detect regions of the field showing NDS; this approach has an impressive IOU score of 0.53. Finally, we show that this architecture can be trained to predict regions of the field which are expected to show NDS in a later flight -- potentially more than three weeks in the future -- maintaining an IOU score of 0.47-0.51 depending on how far in advance the prediction is made. We will also release a dataset which we believe will benefit the computer vision, remote sensing, as well as agriculture fields. This work contributes to the recent developments in deep learning for remote sensing and agriculture, while addressing a key social challenge with implications for economics and sustainability."

We propose a simple and efficient estimator called loop estimator that exploits the regenerative structure of Markov reward processes without explicitly estimating a full model. Our method enjoys a space complexity of $O(1)$ when estimating the value of a single positive recurrent state $s$ unlike TD with $O(S)$ or model-based methods with $O\left(S^2\right)$. Moreover, the regenerative structure enables us to show, without relying on the generative model approach, that the estimator has an instance-dependent convergence rate of $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\tau_s/T}\right)$ over steps $T$ on a single sample path, where $\tau_s$ is the maximal expected hitting time to state $s$. In preliminary numerical experiments, the loop estimator outperforms model-free methods, such as TD(k), and is competitive with the model-based estimator."

Despite the satisfactory performance of this formulation in sparser crowd scenes, its effectiveness is frequently challenged under denser crowd circumstances mainly due to two sources of ambiguity. The first is the mismatch of human joints resulting from the simple cues provided by the Euclidean distances between joints and epipolar lines. The second is the lack of robustness from the naive formulation of the problem as a least squares minimization. In this paper, we depart from the multi-person 3D pose estimation formulation, and instead reformulate it as crowd pose estimation. Our method consists of two key components: a graph model for fast cross-view matching, and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the reconstruction of the 3D human poses. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method on four benchmark datasets."

The advances in explainability have opened the possibility of allowing users to interact with interpretable explanations of ML predictions in order to inject modifications or constraints that more accurately reflect current realities of the system. In this paper, we present a solution which leverages the predictive power of ML models while allowing the user to specify modifications to decision boundaries. Our interactive overlay approach achieves this goal without requiring model retraining, making it appropriate for systems that need to apply instant changes to their decision making. We demonstrate that user feedback rules can be layered with the ML predictions to provide immediate changes which in turn supports learning with less data."
401,aaai,2021,Differentially Private Stochastic Coordinate Descent,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16882,"In this paper we tackle the challenge of making the stochastic coordinate descent algorithm differentially private. Compared to the classical gradient descent algorithm where updates operate on a single model vector and controlled noise addition to this vector suffices to hide critical information about individuals, stochastic coordinate descent crucially relies on keeping auxiliary information in memory during training. This auxiliary information provides an additional privacy leak and poses the major challenge addressed in this work. Driven by the insight that under independent noise addition, the consistency of the auxiliary information holds in expectation, we present DP-SCD, the first differentially private stochastic coordinate descent algorithm. We analyze our new method theoretically and argue that decoupling and parallelizing coordinate updates is essential for its utility. On the empirical side we demonstrate competitive performance against the popular stochastic gradient descent alternative (DP-SGD) while requiring significantly less tuning."

We develop a comprehensive, non-Markovian state transition model, which is validated through accurate prediction of the daily death toll for two epicenters: Wuhan, China and Lombardy, Italy. The model enables prediction of COVID-19 deaths in various scenarios. For example, if treatment priorities had been given to younger patients, the death toll in Wuhan and Lombardy would have been reduced by 10.4\% and 6.7\%, respectively. The strategy depends on the epidemic scale and is more effective in countries with a younger population structure. Analyses of data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Spain suggest that countries with less per capita ICU medical resources should implement this strategy in the early stage of the pandemic to reduce mortalities."

Beyond the existing studies on the predictive performance to adversarial samples, our goal is to understand statistical properties of adversarially robust estimates and analyze adversarial risk in the setup of linear regression models. By discovering the statistical minimax rate of convergence of adversarially robust estimators, we emphasize the importance of incorporating model information, e.g., sparsity, in adversarially robust learning. Further, we reveal an explicit connection of adversarial and standard estimates, and propose a straightforward two-stage adversarial learning framework, which facilitates to utilize model structure information to improve adversarial robustness. In theory, the consistency of the adversarially robust estimator is proven and its Bahadur representation is also developed for the statistical inference purpose. The proposed estimator converges in a sharp rate under either low-dimensional or sparse scenario. Moreover, our theory confirms two phenomena in adversarially robust learning: adversarial robustness hurts generalization, and unlabeled data help improve the generalization. In the end, we conduct numerical simulations to verify our theory."

In this paper, we focus on initializing deep NN parameters such that it performs better, comparing to random or zero initialization. We do this by reducing the process of initialization into an SMT solver. Previous works consider certain activation functions on small NNs, however the studied NN is a deep network with different activation functions. Our experiments show that the proposed approach for parameter initialization achieves better performance comparing to randomly initialized networks."
405,aaai,2021,Escaping Local Optima with Non-Elitist Evolutionary Algorithms,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17457,"We present a time complexity analysis of the Opt-IA artificial immune system (AIS). We first highlight the power and limitations of its distinguishing operators (i.e., hypermutations with mutation potential and ageing) by analysing them in isolation. Recent work has shown that ageing combined with local mutations can help escape local optima on a dynamic optimisation benchmark function. We generalise this result by rigorously proving that, compared to evolutionary algorithms (EAs), ageing leads to impressive speed-ups on the standard Cliff benchmark function both when using local and global mutations. Unless the stop at first constructive mutation (FCM) mechanism is applied, we show that hypermutations require exponential expected runtime to optimise any function with a polynomial number of optima. If instead FCM is used, the expected runtime is at most a linear factor larger than the upper bound achieved for any random local search algorithm using the artificial fitness levels method. Nevertheless, we prove that algorithms using hypermutations can be considerably faster than EAs at escaping local optima. An analysis of the complete Opt-IA reveals that it is efficient on the previously considered functions and highlights problems where the use of the full algorithm is crucial. We complete the picture by presenting a class of functions for which Opt-IA fails with overwhelming probability while standard EAs are efficient."

To do so, logical propositions are converted to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and reformulated into equivalent algebraic constraints.

The package supports reformulations for disjunctions containing linear, quadratic, and nonlinear constraints."

It is of substantial scientific interest to study how brain connectivity varies over time in relation to human cognitive traits. In brain connectomics, the structural brain network for an individual corresponds to a set of interconnections among brain regions. We propose a symmetric bilinear logistic regression to learn a set of small subgraphs relevant to a binary outcome from longitudinal brain networks as well as estimating the time effects of the subgraphs. We enforce the extracted signal subgraphs to have clique structure which has appealing interpretations as they can be related to neurological circuits. The time effect of each signal subgraph reflects how its predictive effect on the outcome varies over time, which may improve our understanding of interactions between the aging of brain structure and neurological disorders. Application of this method on longitudinal brain connectomics and cognitive capacity data shows interesting discovery of relevant interconnections among a small set of brain regions in frontal and temporal lobes with better predictive performance than competitors."
409,aaai,2021,A Simple Framework for Cognitive Planning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16786,"""Cognitive synergy"" refers to a dynamic in which multiple cognitive processes, cooperating to control the same cognitive system, assist each other in overcoming bottlenecks encountered during their internal processing. Cognitive synergy has been posited as a key feature of real-world general intelligence, and has been used explicitly in the design of the OpenCog cognitive architecture. Here category theory and related concepts are used to give a formalization of the cognitive synergy concept.   A series of formal models of intelligent agents is proposed, with increasing specificity and complexity: simple reinforcement learning agents; ""cognit"" agents with an abstract memory and processing model; hypergraph-based agents (in which ""cognit"" operations are carried out via hypergraphs); hypergraph agents with a rich language of nodes and hyperlinks (such as the OpenCog framework provides); ""PGMC"" agents whose rich hypergraphs are endowed with cognitive processes guided via Probabilistic Growth and Mining of Combinations; and finally variations of the PrimeAGI design, which is currently being built on top of OpenCog.   A notion of cognitive synergy is developed for cognitive processes acting within PGMC agents, based on developing a formal notion of ""stuckness,"" and defining synergy as a relationship between cognitive processes in which they can help each other out when they get stuck. It is proposed that cognitive processes relating to each other synergetically, associate in a certain way with functors that map into each other via natural transformations. Cognitive synergy is proposed to correspond to a certain inequality regarding the relative costs of different paths through certain commutation diagrams.   Applications of this notion of cognitive synergy to particular cognitive phenomena, and specific cognitive processes in the PrimeAGI design, are discussed."
410,aaai,2021,Differentially Private Link Prediction with Protected Connections,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16078,"Link prediction (LP) algorithms propose to each node a ranked list of nodes that are currently non-neighbors, as the most likely candidates for future linkage. Owing to increasing concerns about privacy, users (nodes) may prefer to keep some of their connections protected or private. Motivated by this observation, our goal is to design a differentially private LP algorithm, which trades off between privacy of the protected node-pairs and the link prediction accuracy. More specifically, we first propose a form of differential privacy on graphs, which models the privacy loss only of those node-pairs which are marked as protected. Next, we develop DPLP , a learning to rank algorithm, which applies a monotone transform to base scores from a non-private LP system, and then adds noise. DPLP is trained with a privacy induced ranking loss, which optimizes the ranking utility for a given maximum allowed level of privacy leakage of the protected node-pairs. Under a recently-introduced latent node embedding model, we present a formal trade-off between privacy and LP utility. Extensive experiments with several real-life graphs and several LP heuristics show that DPLP can trade off between privacy and predictive performance more effectively than several alternatives."
411,aaai,2021,Classification Under Human Assistance,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16738,"Most supervised learning models are trained for full automation. However, their predictions are sometimes worse than those by human experts on some specific instances. Motivated by this empirical observation, our goal is to design classifiers that are optimized to operate under different automation levels. More specifically, we focus on convex margin-based classifiers and first show that the problem is NP-hard. Then, we further show that, for support vector machines, the corresponding objective function can be expressed as the difference of two functions f = g - c, where g is monotone, non-negative and {\gamma}-weakly submodular, and c is non-negative and modular. This representation allows a recently introduced deterministic greedy algorithm, as well as a more efficient randomized variant of the algorithm, to enjoy approximation guarantees at solving the problem. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data from several applications in medical diagnosis illustrate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that, under human assistance, supervised learning models trained to operate under different automation levels can outperform those trained for full automation as well as humans operating alone."
412,aaai,2021,Sample-Efficient L0-L2 Constrained Structure Learning of Sparse Ising Models,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16884,"Previous attempts to build effective semantic parsers for Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) conversations suffer from the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality, manually annotated training set. Approaches based only on dialogue synthesis are insufficient, as dialogues generated from state-machine based models are poor approximations of real-life conversations. Furthermore, previously proposed dialogue state representations are ambiguous and lack the precision necessary for building an effective agent. This paper proposes a new dialogue representation and a sample-efficient methodology that can predict precise dialogue states in WOZ conversations. We extended the ThingTalk representation to capture all information an agent needs to respond properly. Our training strategy is sample-efficient: we combine (1) fewshot data sparsely sampling the full dialogue space and (2) synthesized data covering a subset space of dialogues generated by a succinct state-based dialogue model. The completeness of the extended ThingTalk language is demonstrated with a fully operational agent, which is also used in training data synthesis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on MultiWOZ 3.0, a reannotation of the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset in ThingTalk. ThingTalk can represent 98% of the test turns, while the simulator can emulate 85% of the validation set. We train a contextual semantic parser using our strategy, and obtain 79% turn-by-turn exact match accuracy on the reannotated test set."

It has recently been noted that many of these problems fall into polynomial time if the electorate is single-peaked (i.e., is polarized along some axis/issue). However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked. There are usually some mavericks, and so real-world electorates tend to merely be nearly single-peaked. This paper studies the complexity of manipulative-action algorithms for elections over nearly single-peaked electorates, for various notions of nearness and various election systems. We provide instances where even one maverick jumps the manipulative-action complexity up to $\np$-hardness, but we also provide many instances where a reasonable number of mavericks can be tolerated without increasing the manipulative-action complexity."
414,aaai,2021,Optimal Decision Trees for Nonlinear Metrics,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16490,"Nonlinear metrics, such as the F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient, and Fowlkes-Mallows index, are often used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, in particular, when facing imbalanced datasets that contain more samples of one class than the other. Recent optimal decision tree algorithms have shown remarkable progress in producing trees that are optimal with respect to linear criteria, such as accuracy, but unfortunately nonlinear metrics remain a challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel algorithm based on bi-objective optimisation, which treats misclassifications of each binary class as a separate objective. We show that, for a large class of metrics, the optimal tree lies on the Pareto frontier. Consequently, we obtain the optimal tree by using our method to generate the set of all nondominated trees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to compute provably optimal decision trees for nonlinear metrics. Our approach leads to a trade-off when compared to optimising linear metrics: the resulting trees may be more desirable according to the given nonlinear metric at the expense of higher runtimes. Nevertheless, the experiments illustrate that runtimes are reasonable for majority of the tested datasets."
415,aaai,2021,Graph Neural Network-Based Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16523,"Anomalies in univariate time series often refer to abnormal values and deviations from the temporal patterns from majority of historical observations. In multivariate time series, anomalies also refer to abnormal changes in the inter-series relationship, such as correlation, over time. Existing studies have been able to model such inter-series relationships through graph neural networks. However, most works settle on learning a static graph globally or within a context window to assist a time series forecasting task or a reconstruction task, whose objective is not tailored to explicitly detect the abnormal relationship. Some other works detect anomalies based on reconstructing or forecasting a list of inter-series graphs, which inadvertently weakens their power to capture temporal patterns within the data due to the discrete nature of graphs. In this study, we propose DyGraphAD, a multivariate time series anomaly detection framework based upon a list of dynamic inter-series graphs. The core idea is to detect anomalies based on the deviation of inter-series relationships and intra-series temporal patterns from normal to anomalous states, by leveraging the evolving nature of the graphs in order to assist a graph forecasting task and a time series forecasting task simultaneously. Our numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DyGraphAD has superior performance than baseline anomaly detection approaches."
416,aaai,2021,Voxel R-CNN: Towards High Performance Voxel-based 3D Object Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16207,"Recent advances on 3D object detection heavily rely on how the 3D data are represented, \emph{i.e.}, voxel-based or point-based representation. Many existing high performance 3D detectors are point-based because this structure can better retain precise point positions. Nevertheless, point-level features lead to high computation overheads due to unordered storage. In contrast, the voxel-based structure is better suited for feature extraction but often yields lower accuracy because the input data are divided into grids. In this paper, we take a slightly different viewpoint -- we find that precise positioning of raw points is not essential for high performance 3D object detection and that the coarse voxel granularity can also offer sufficient detection accuracy. Bearing this view in mind, we devise a simple but effective voxel-based framework, named Voxel R-CNN. By taking full advantage of voxel features in a two stage approach, our method achieves comparable detection accuracy with state-of-the-art point-based models, but at a fraction of the computation cost. Voxel R-CNN consists of a 3D backbone network, a 2D bird-eye-view (BEV) Region Proposal Network and a detect head. A voxel RoI pooling is devised to extract RoI features directly from voxel features for further refinement. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used KITTI Dataset and the more recent Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that compared to existing voxel-based methods, Voxel R-CNN delivers a higher detection accuracy while maintaining a real-time frame processing rate, \emph{i.e}., at a speed of 25 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/djiajunustc/Voxel-R-CNN}."

Compared with traditional image style transfer, performing this task on video presents new challenges: how to effectively generate satisfactory stylized results for any specified style, and maintain temporal coherence across frames at the same time. Towards this end, we propose Multi-Channel Correction network (MCCNet), which can be trained to fuse the exemplar style features and input content features for efficient style transfer while naturally maintaining the coherence of input videos. Specifically, MCCNet works directly on the feature space of style and content domain where it learns to rearrange and fuse style features based on their similarity with content features. The outputs generated by MCC are features containing the desired style patterns which can further be decoded into images with vivid style textures. Moreover, MCCNet is also designed to explicitly align the features to input which ensures the output maintains the content structures as well as the temporal continuity. To further improve the performance of MCCNet under complex light conditions, we also introduce the illumination loss during training. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MCCNet performs well in both arbitrary video and image style transfer tasks."
418,aaai,2021,Learning with Retrospection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16885,"We present a Reverse Reinforcement Learning (Reverse RL) approach for representing retrospective knowledge. General Value Functions (GVFs) have enjoyed great success in representing predictive knowledge, i.e., answering questions about possible future outcomes such as ""how much fuel will be consumed in expectation if we drive from A to B?"". GVFs, however, cannot answer questions like ""how much fuel do we expect a car to have given it is at B at time $t$?"". To answer this question, we need to know when that car had a full tank and how that car came to B. Since such questions emphasize the influence of possible past events on the present, we refer to their answers as retrospective knowledge. In this paper, we show how to represent retrospective knowledge with Reverse GVFs, which are trained via Reverse RL. We demonstrate empirically the utility of Reverse GVFs in both representation learning and anomaly detection."
419,aaai,2021,A Unified Taylor Framework for Revisiting Attribution Methods,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17365,"Attribution methods provide an insight into the decision-making process of machine learning models, especially deep neural networks, by assigning contribution scores to each individual feature. However, the attribution problem has not been well-defined, which lacks a unified guideline to the contribution assignment process. Furthermore, existing attribution methods often built upon various empirical intuitions and heuristics. There still lacks a general theoretical framework that not only can offer a good description of the attribution problem, but also can be applied to unifying and revisiting existing attribution methods. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a Taylor attribution framework, which models the attribution problem as how to decide individual payoffs in a coalition. Then, we reformulate fourteen mainstream attribution methods into the Taylor framework and analyze these attribution methods in terms of rationale, fidelity, and limitation in the framework. Moreover, we establish three principles for a good attribution in the Taylor attribution framework, i.e., low approximation error, correct Taylor contribution assignment, and unbiased baseline selection. Finally, we empirically validate the Taylor reformulations and reveal a positive correlation between the attribution performance and the number of principles followed by the attribution method via benchmarking on real-world datasets."

It also provides natural benefits when deployed on the cloud since resources can be allocated dynamically to necessary components based on demand. Therefore, enterprises as part of their journey to cloud, are increasingly looking to refactor their monolith application into one or more candidate microservices; wherein each service contains a group of software entities (e.g., classes) that are responsible for a common functionality. Graphs are a natural choice to represent a software system. Each software entity can be represented as nodes and its dependencies with other entities as links. Therefore, this problem of refactoring can be viewed as a graph based clustering task. In this work, we propose a novel method to adapt the recent advancements in graph neural networks in the context of code to better understand the software and apply them in the clustering task. In that process, we also identify the outliers in the graph which can be directly mapped to top refactor candidates in the software. Our solution is able to improve state-of-the-art performance compared to works from both software engineering and existing graph representation based techniques."
422,aaai,2021,Shape-based Feature Engineering for Solar Flare Prediction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17795,"We study the prediction of solar flare size and time-to-flare using 38 features describing magnetic complexity of the photospheric magnetic field. This work uses support vector regression to formulate a mapping from the 38-dimensional feature space to a continuous-valued label vector representing flare size or time-to-flare. When we consider flaring regions only, we find an average error in estimating flare size of approximately half a \emph{geostationary operational environmental satellite} (\emph{GOES}) class. When we additionally consider non-flaring regions, we find an increased average error of approximately 3/4 a \emph{GOES} class. We also consider thresholding the regressed flare size for the experiment containing both flaring and non-flaring regions and find a true positive rate of 0.69 and a true negative rate of 0.86 for flare prediction. The results for both of these size regression experiments are consistent across a wide range of predictive time windows, indicating that the magnetic complexity features may be persistent in appearance long before flare activity. This is supported by our larger error rates of some 40 hr in the time-to-flare regression problem. The 38 magnetic complexity features considered here appear to have discriminative potential for flare size, but their persistence in time makes them less discriminative for the time-to-flare problem."
423,aaai,2021,Mercer Features for Efficient Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16886,"Bayesian optimization (BO) is an efficient framework for solving black-box optimization problems with expensive function evaluations. This paper addresses the BO problem setting for combinatorial spaces (e.g., sequences and graphs) that occurs naturally in science and engineering applications. A prototypical example is molecular optimization guided by expensive experiments. The key challenge is to balance the complexity of statistical models and tractability of search to select combinatorial structures for evaluation. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach referred as Mercer Features for Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization (MerCBO). The key idea behind MerCBO is to provide explicit feature maps for diffusion kernels over discrete objects by exploiting the structure of their combinatorial graph representation. These Mercer features combined with Thompson sampling as the acquisition function allows us to employ tractable solvers to find next structures for evaluation. Experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MerCBO performs similarly or better than prior methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/aryandeshwal/MerCBO ."

Existing approaches typically apply constrained optimization techniques to ML training, enforce constraint satisfaction by adjusting the model design, or use constraints to correct the output. Here, we investigate a different, complementary, strategy based on ""teaching"" constraint satisfaction to a supervised ML method via the direct use of a state-of-the-art constraint solver: this enables taking advantage of decades of research on constrained optimization with limited effort. In practice, we use a decomposition scheme alternating master steps (in charge of enforcing the constraints) and learner steps (where any supervised ML model and training algorithm can be employed). The process leads to approximate constraint satisfaction in general, and convergence properties are difficult to establish; despite this fact, we found empirically that even a na\""ive setup of our approach performs well on ML tasks with fairness constraints, and on classical datasets with synthetic constraints."

They will be called k-disjunctive cuts. The starting point is the question what kind of cuts is needed for a finite cutting plane algorithm for general mixed integer programs. We will deal with this question in detail and derive cutting planes based on k-disjunctions related to a given cut vector. Finally we will show how a finite cutting plane algorithm can be established using these cuts in combination with Gomory mixed integer cuts."
426,aaai,2021,Graph Learning for Inverse Landscape Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17731,"The problem of inferring unknown graph edges from numerical data at a graph's nodes appears in many forms across machine learning. We study a version of this problem that arises in the field of \emph{landscape genetics}, where genetic similarity between organisms living in a heterogeneous landscape is explained by a weighted graph that encodes the ease of dispersal through that landscape. Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for \emph{inverse landscape genetics}, which is the task of inferring this graph from measurements of genetic similarity at different locations (graph nodes). Inverse landscape genetics is important in discovering impediments to species dispersal that threaten biodiversity and long-term species survival. In particular, it is widely used to study the effects of climate change and human development. Drawing on influential work that models organism dispersal using graph \emph{effective resistances} (McRae 2006), we reduce the inverse landscape genetics problem to that of inferring graph edges from noisy measurements of these resistances, which can be obtained from genetic similarity data. Building on the NeurIPS 2018 work of Hoskins et al. 2018 on learning edges in social networks, we develop an efficient first-order optimization method for solving this problem. Despite its non-convex nature, experiments on synthetic and real genetic data establish that our method provides fast and reliable convergence, significantly outperforming existing heuristics used in the field. By providing researchers with a powerful, general purpose algorithmic tool, we hope our work will have a positive impact on accelerating work on landscape genetics."

Recently, Vinyals et al. tested neural conversation models using OpenSubtitles. Lowe et al. released the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus for researching unstructured multi-turn dialogue systems. Furthermore, the approach has been extended to accomplish task oriented dialogs to provide information properly with natural conversation. For example, Ghazvininejad et al. proposed a knowledge grounded neural conversation model [3], where the research is aiming at combining conversational dialogs with task-oriented knowledge using unstructured data such as Twitter data for conversation and Foursquare data for external knowledge.However, the task is still limited to a restaurant information service, and has not yet been tested with a wide variety of dialog tasks. In addition, it is still unclear how to create intelligent dialog systems that can respond like a human agent.   In consideration of these problems, we proposed a challenge track to the 6th dialog system technology challenges (DSTC6) using human-to-human dialog data to mimic human dialog behaviors. The focus of the challenge track is to train end-to-end conversation models from human-to-human conversation and accomplish end-to-end dialog tasks in various situations assuming a customer service, in which a system plays a role of human agent and generates natural and informative sentences in response to user's questions or comments given dialog context."

However, how to make the most of these alignments to infer more accurate matching scores is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Similarity Graph Reasoning and Attention Filtration (SGRAF) network for image-text matching. Specifically, the vector-based similarity representations are firstly learned to characterize the local and global alignments in a more comprehensive manner, and then the Similarity Graph Reasoning (SGR) module relying on one graph convolutional neural network is introduced to infer relation-aware similarities with both the local and global alignments. The Similarity Attention Filtration (SAF) module is further developed to integrate these alignments effectively by selectively attending on the significant and representative alignments and meanwhile casting aside the interferences of non-meaningful alignments. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method with achieving state-of-the-art performances on the Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets, and the good interpretability of SGR and SAF modules with extensive qualitative experiments and analyses."

The STA descriptors are local histogram-based descriptors of space-time, suitable for building a partial representation of arbitrary spatio-temporal phenomena. Because of the possibility of iterative refinement, they are interesting in the context of online human action recognition. We investigate the use of dense optical flow as the image function of the STA descriptor for human action recognition, using two different algorithms for computing the flow: the Farneb\""ack algorithm and the TVL1 algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the influencing optical flow algorithm parameters on the produced optical flow fields. An extensive experimental validation of optical flow-based STA descriptors in human action recognition is performed on the KTH human action dataset. The encouraging experimental results suggest the potential of our approach in online human action recognition."

These systems require that the internal nodes have the same memory capacity and compute performance. Unfortunately, most organizations, especially universities, have a piecemeal approach to purchasing computer systems resulting in a heterogeneous infrastructure, which cannot be used to compute large models. The present work describes HetSeq, a software package adapted from the popular PyTorch package that provides the capability to train large neural network models on heterogeneous infrastructure. Experiments with transformer translation and BERT language model shows that HetSeq scales over heterogeneous systems. HetSeq can be easily extended to other models like image classification.

431,aaai,2021,Incorporating Curiosity into Personalized Ranking for Collaborative Filtering (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17885,"Curiosity is a vital metacognitive skill in educational contexts, leading to creativity, and a love of learning. And while many school systems increasingly undercut curiosity by teaching to the test, teachers are increasingly interested in how to evoke curiosity in their students to prepare them for a world in which lifelong learning and reskilling will be more and more important. One aspect of curiosity that has received little attention, however, is the role of peers in eliciting curiosity. We present what we believe to be the first theoretical framework that articulates an integrated socio-cognitive account of curiosity that ties observable behaviors in peers to underlying curiosity states. We make a bipartite distinction between individual and interpersonal functions that contribute to curiosity, and multimodal behaviors that fulfill these functions. We validate the proposed framework by leveraging a longitudinal latent variable modeling approach. Findings confirm a positive predictive relationship between the latent variables of individual and interpersonal functions and curiosity, with the interpersonal functions exercising a comparatively stronger influence. Prominent behavioral realizations of these functions are also discovered in a data-driven manner. We instantiate the proposed theoretical framework in a set of strategies and tactics that can be incorporated into learning technologies to indicate, evoke, and scaffold curiosity. This work is a step towards designing learning technologies that can recognize and evoke moment-by-moment curiosity during learning in social contexts and towards a more complete multimodal learning analytics. The underlying rationale is applicable more generally for developing computer support for other metacognitive and socio-emotional skills."

Federated learning is a distributed learning framework that enables multi-institutional collaborations on decentralized data with improved protection for each collaborator's data privacy. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient scheme for decentralized federated learning called ProxyFL, or proxy-based federated learning. Each participant in ProxyFL maintains two models, a private model, and a publicly shared proxy model designed to protect the participant's privacy. Proxy models allow efficient information exchange among participants without the need of a centralized server. The proposed method eliminates a significant limitation of canonical federated learning by allowing model heterogeneity; each participant can have a private model with any architecture. Furthermore, our protocol for communication by proxy leads to stronger privacy guarantees using differential privacy analysis. Experiments on popular image datasets, and a cancer diagnostic problem using high-quality gigapixel histology whole slide images, show that ProxyFL can outperform existing alternatives with much less communication overhead and stronger privacy."
434,aaai,2021,A Hybrid Bandit Framework for Diversified Recommendation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16524,"The interactive recommender systems involve users in the recommendation procedure by receiving timely user feedback to update the recommendation policy. Therefore, they are widely used in real application scenarios. Previous interactive recommendation methods primarily focus on learning users' personalized preferences on the relevance properties of an item set. However, the investigation of users' personalized preferences on the diversity properties of an item set is usually ignored. To overcome this problem, we propose the Linear Modular Dispersion Bandit (LMDB) framework, which is an online learning setting for optimizing a combination of modular functions and dispersion functions. Specifically, LMDB employs modular functions to model the relevance properties of each item, and dispersion functions to describe the diversity properties of an item set. Moreover, we also develop a learning algorithm, called Linear Modular Dispersion Hybrid (LMDH) to solve the LMDB problem and derive a gap-free bound on its n-step regret. Extensive experiments on real datasets are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LMDB framework in balancing the recommendation accuracy and diversity."
435,aaai,2021,Knowledge Refinery: Learning from Decoupled Label,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16888,"Current video-based scene graph generation (VidSGG) methods have been found to perform poorly on predicting predicates that are less represented due to the inherent biased distribution in the training data. In this paper, we take a closer look at the predicates and identify that most visual relations (e.g. sit_above) involve both actional pattern (sit) and spatial pattern (above), while the distribution bias is much less severe at the pattern level. Based on this insight, we propose a decoupled label learning (DLL) paradigm to address the intractable visual relation prediction from the pattern-level perspective. Specifically, DLL decouples the predicate labels and adopts separate classifiers to learn actional and spatial patterns respectively. The patterns are then combined and mapped back to the predicate. Moreover, we propose a knowledge-level label decoupling method to transfer non-target knowledge from head predicates to tail predicates within the same pattern to calibrate the distribution of tail classes. We validate the effectiveness of DLL on the commonly used VidSGG benchmark, i.e. VidVRD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the DLL offers a remarkably simple but highly effective solution to the long-tailed problem, achieving the state-of-the-art VidSGG performance."

DNNs have achieved high performance in 3D object detection, but they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These attacks have been heavily investigated in the RGB image domain and more recently in the point cloud domain, but rarely in both domains simultaneously - a gap to be filled in this paper. We use a single 3D mesh and differentiable rendering to explore how perturbing the mesh's geometry and texture can reduce the robustness of DNNs to adversarial attacks. We attack a prominent cascaded multi-modal DNN, the Frustum-Pointnet model. Using the popular KITTI benchmark, we showed that the proposed universal multi-modal attack was successful in reducing the model's ability to detect a car by nearly 73%. This work can aid in the understanding of what the cascaded RGB-point cloud DNN learns and its vulnerability to adversarial attacks."

However, labeling medical images is very expensive since it requires sophisticated expert knowledge. Thus, it is more desirable to employ only a few labeled data in pursuing high segmentation performance. In this paper, we develop a data augmentation method for one-shot brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation which exploits only one labeled MRI image (named atlas) and a few unlabeled images. In particular, we propose to learn the probability distributions of deformations (including shapes and intensities) of different unlabeled MRI images with respect to the atlas via 3D variational autoencoders (VAEs). In this manner, our method is able to exploit the learned distributions of image deformations to generate new authentic brain MRI images, and the number of generated samples will be sufficient to train a deep segmentation network. Furthermore, we introduce a new standard segmentation benchmark to evaluate the generalization performance of a segmentation network through a cross-dataset setting (collected from different sources). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art one-shot medical segmentation methods.

One successful approach, RolloutIW, represents states with the B-PROST boolean feature set. An augmented version of RolloutIW, $\pi$-IW, shows that learned features can be competitive with handcrafted ones for width-based search. In this paper, we leverage variational autoencoders (VAEs) to learn features directly from pixels in a principled manner, and without supervision. The inference model of the trained VAEs extracts boolean features from pixels, and RolloutIW plans with these features. The resulting combination outperforms the original RolloutIW and human professional play on Atari 2600 and drastically reduces the size of the feature set."

The first integrates weight perturbation (WP) into existing ""consistency regularization"" (CR) based methods. We implement WP by leveraging variational Bayesian inference (VBI). The second method proposes a novel consistency loss called ""maximum uncertainty regularization"" (MUR). While most consistency losses act on perturbations in the vicinity of each data point, MUR actively searches for ""virtual"" points situated beyond this region that cause the most uncertain class predictions. This allows MUR to impose smoothness on a wider area in the input-output manifold. Our experiments show clear improvements in classification errors of various CR based methods when they are combined with VBI or MUR or both."

442,aaai,2021,Model-sharing Games: Analyzing Federated Learning Under Voluntary Participation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16669,"Federated learning enables machine learning algorithms to be trained over a network of multiple decentralized edge devices without requiring the exchange of local datasets. Successfully deploying federated learning requires ensuring that agents (e.g., mobile devices) faithfully execute the intended algorithm, which has been largely overlooked in the literature. In this study, we first use risk bounds to analyze how the key feature of federated learning, unbalanced and non-i.i.d. data, affects agents' incentives to voluntarily participate and obediently follow traditional federated learning algorithms. To be more specific, our analysis reveals that agents with less typical data distributions and relatively more samples are more likely to opt out of or tamper with federated learning algorithms. To this end, we formulate the first faithful implementation problem of federated learning and design two faithful federated learning mechanisms which satisfy economic properties, scalability, and privacy. Further, the time complexity of computing all agents' payments in the number of agents is $\mathcal{O}(1)$. First, we design a Faithful Federated Learning (FFL) mechanism which approximates the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) payments via an incremental computation. We show that it achieves (probably approximate) optimality, faithful implementation, voluntary participation, and some other economic properties (such as budget balance). Second, by partitioning agents into several subsets, we present a scalable VCG mechanism approximation. We further design a scalable and Differentially Private FFL (DP-FFL) mechanism, the first differentially private faithful mechanism, that maintains the economic properties. Our mechanism enables one to make three-way performance tradeoffs among privacy, the iterations needed, and payment accuracy loss."
443,aaai,2021,I3DOL: Incremental 3D Object Learning without Catastrophic Forgetting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16756,"3D object classification has attracted appealing attentions in academic researches and industrial applications. However, most existing methods need to access the training data of past 3D object classes when facing the common real-world scenario: new classes of 3D objects arrive in a sequence. Moreover, the performance of advanced approaches degrades dramatically for past learned classes (i.e., catastrophic forgetting), due to the irregular and redundant geometric structures of 3D point cloud data. To address these challenges, we propose a new Incremental 3D Object Learning (i.e., I3DOL) model, which is the first exploration to learn new classes of 3D object continually. Specifically, an adaptive-geometric centroid module is designed to construct discriminative local geometric structures, which can better characterize the irregular point cloud representation for 3D object. Afterwards, to prevent the catastrophic forgetting brought by redundant geometric information, a geometric-aware attention mechanism is developed to quantify the contributions of local geometric structures, and explore unique 3D geometric characteristics with high contributions for classes incremental learning. Meanwhile, a score fairness compensation strategy is proposed to further alleviate the catastrophic forgetting caused by unbalanced data between past and new classes of 3D object, by compensating biased prediction for new classes in the validation phase. Experiments on 3D representative datasets validate the superiority of our I3DOL framework."

In this paper, a gradient-based low-light image enhancement algorithm is proposed. The key is to enhance the gradients of dark region, because the gradients are more sensitive for human visual system than absolute values. In addition, we involve the intensity-range constraints for the image integration. By using the intensity-range constraints, we can integrate the output image with enhanced gradients preserving the given gradient information while enforcing the intensity range of the output image within a certain intensity range. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed gradient-based low-light image enhancement can effectively enhance the low-light images."

The key to its success is to transfer knowledge from a large teacher network to a small student one. However, most of the existing knowledge distillation methods consider only one type of knowledge learned from either instance features or instance relations via a specific distillation strategy in teacher-student learning. There are few works that explore the idea of transferring different types of knowledge with different distillation strategies in a unified framework. Moreover, the frequently used offline distillation suffers from a limited learning capacity due to the fixed teacher-student architecture. In this paper we propose a collaborative teacher-student learning via multiple knowledge transfer (CTSL-MKT) that prompts both self-learning and collaborative learning. It allows multiple students learn knowledge from both individual instances and instance relations in a collaborative way. While learning from themselves with self-distillation, they can also guide each other via online distillation. The experiments and ablation studies on four image datasets demonstrate that the proposed CTSL-MKT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods."

The key idea is to generate source transcript and target translation text with a single decoder. It benefits the model training so that additional large parallel text corpus can be fully exploited to enhance the speech translation training. Our method is verified on three mainstream datasets, including Augmented LibriSpeech English-French dataset, IWSLT2018 English-German dataset, and TED English-Chinese dataset.

In this paper, we propose Listen-Understand-Translate, (LUT), a unified framework with triple supervision signals to decouple the end-to-end speech-to-text translation task. LUT is able to guide the acoustic encoder to extract as much information from the auditory input. In addition, LUT utilizes a pre-trained BERT model to enforce the upper encoder to produce as much semantic information as possible, without extra data.

However, the performance of this framework relies critically on the availability of an accurate DMP, sufficient decisions of high quality, and a parameter space that contains enough information about the DMP. To hedge against the uncertainties in the hypothetical DMP, the data, and the parameter space, we investigate in this paper the distributionally robust approach for inverse multiobjective optimization. Specifically, we leverage the Wasserstein metric to construct a ball centered at the empirical distribution of these decisions. We then formulate a Wasserstein distributionally robust inverse multiobjective optimization problem (WRO-IMOP) that minimizes a worst-case expected loss function, where the worst case is taken over all distributions in the Wasserstein ball. We show that the excess risk of the WRO-IMOP estimator has a sub-linear convergence rate. Furthermore, we propose the semi-infinite reformulations of the WRO-IMOP and develop a cutting-plane algorithm that converges to an approximate solution in finite iterations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both a synthetic multiobjective quadratic program and a real world portfolio optimization problem."

In this work, we focus on the task of image-based mutual gaze detection, and propose a simple and effective approach to boost the performance by using an auxiliary 3D gaze estimation task during the training phase. We achieve the performance boost without additional labeling cost by training the 3D gaze estimation branch using pseudo 3D gaze labels deduced from mutual gaze labels. By sharing the head image encoder between the 3D gaze estimation and the mutual gaze detection branches, we achieve better head features than learned by training the mutual gaze detection branch alone. Experimental results on three image datasets show that the proposed approach improves the detection performance significantly without additional annotations. This work also introduces a new image dataset that consists of 33.1K pairs of humans annotated with mutual gaze labels in 29.2K images."

Exposure to trauma, violence, and substance abuse, coupled with a lack of community support services, puts homeless youth at high risk of being exploited and trafficked. Although access to safe housing and supportive services such as physical and mental healthcare is an effective response to youths vulnerability towards being trafficked, the number of youth experiencing homelessness exceeds the capacity of available housing resources in most US communities. We undertake a RHY-informed, systematic, and data driven approach to project the collective capacity required by service providers to adequately meet the needs of homeless youth in New York City, including those most at risk of being trafficked. Our approach involves an integer linear programming model that extends the multiple multidimensional knapsack problem and is informed by partnerships with key stakeholders. The mathematical model allows for time-dependent allocation and capacity expansion, while incorporating stochastic youth arrivals and length of stays, services provided in a periodic fashion, and service delivery time windows. Our RHY and service provider-centered approach is an important step toward meeting the actual, rather than presumed, survival needs of vulnerable youth, particularly those at-risk of being trafficked."

We present the MultiTalk Dataset, a corpus of over 320,000 sentences of written conversational dialog that balances a high branching factor (10) with several conversation turns (6) through selective branch continuation. We make multiple contributions to study dialog generation in the highly branching setting. In order to evaluate a diverse set of generations, we propose a simple scoring algorithm, based on bipartite graph matching, to optimally incorporate a set of diverse references. We study multiple language generation tasks at different levels of predictive conversation depth, using textual attributes induced automatically from pretrained classifiers. Our culminating task is a challenging theory of mind problem, a controllable generation task which requires reasoning about the expected reaction of the listener."
452,aaai,2021,Using Radio Archives for Low-Resource Speech Recognition: Towards an Intelligent Virtual Assistant for Illiterate Users,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17733,"For many of the 700 million illiterate people around the world, speech recognition technology could provide a bridge to valuable information and services. Yet, those most in need of this technology are often the most underserved by it. In many countries, illiterate people tend to speak only low-resource languages, for which the datasets necessary for speech technology development are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised speech representation learning on noisy radio broadcasting archives, which are abundant even in low-resource languages. We make three core contributions. First, we release two datasets to the research community. The first, West African Radio Corpus, contains 142 hours of audio in more than 10 languages with a labeled validation subset. The second, West African Virtual Assistant Speech Recognition Corpus, consists of 10K labeled audio clips in four languages. Next, we share West African wav2vec, a speech encoder trained on the noisy radio corpus, and compare it with the baseline Facebook speech encoder trained on six times more data of higher quality. We show that West African wav2vec performs similarly to the baseline on a multilingual speech recognition task, and significantly outperforms the baseline on a West African language identification task. Finally, we share the first-ever speech recognition models for Maninka, Pular and Susu, languages spoken by a combined 10 million people in over seven countries, including six where the majority of the adult population is illiterate. Our contributions offer a path forward for ethical AI research to serve the needs of those most disadvantaged by the digital divide."

The recently introduced neural Shuffle-Exchange network offers a computation-efficient alternative, enabling the modelling of long-range dependencies in O(n log n) time. The model, however, is quite complex, involving a sophisticated gating mechanism derived from the Gated Recurrent Unit. In this paper, we present a simple and lightweight variant of the Shuffle-Exchange network, which is based on a residual network employing GELU and Layer Normalization. The proposed architecture not only scales to longer sequences but also converges faster and provides better accuracy. It surpasses the Shuffle-Exchange network on the LAMBADA language modelling task and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MusicNet dataset for music transcription while being efficient in the number of parameters. We show how to combine the improved Shuffle-Exchange network with convolutional layers, establishing it as a useful building block in long sequence processing applications."
454,aaai,2021,On Fair Division under Heterogeneous Matroid Constraints,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16670,"We study fair allocation of indivisible goods among additive agents with feasibility constraints. In these settings, every agent is restricted to get a bundle among a specified set of feasible bundles. Such scenarios have been of great interest to the AI community due to their applicability to real-world problems. Following some impossibility results, we restrict attention to matroid feasibility constraints that capture natural scenarios, such as the allocation of shifts to medical doctors, and the allocation of conference papers to referees.   We focus on the common fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). Previous algorithms for finding EF1 allocations are either restricted to agents with identical feasibility constraints, or allow free disposal of items. An open problem is the existence of EF1 complete allocations among heterogeneous agents, where the heterogeneity is both in the agents' feasibility constraints and in their valuations. In this work, we make progress on this problem by providing positive and negative results for different matroid and valuation types. Among other results, we devise polynomial-time algorithms for finding EF1 allocations in the following settings: (i) $n$ agents with heterogeneous partition matroids and heterogeneous binary valuations, (ii) 2 agents with heterogeneous partition matroids and heterogeneous additive valuations, and (iii) at most 3 agents with heterogeneous binary valuations and identical base-orderable matroid constraints."

However, due to its nature of multiple training and resampling, bootstrapping deep neural networks is computationally burdensome; hence it has difficulties in practical application to the uncertainty estimation and related tasks. To overcome this computational bottleneck, we propose a novel approach called \emph{Neural Bootstrapper} (NeuBoots), which learns to generate bootstrapped neural networks through single model training. NeuBoots injects the bootstrap weights into the high-level feature layers of the backbone network and outputs the bootstrapped predictions of the target, without additional parameters and the repetitive computations from scratch. We apply NeuBoots to various machine learning tasks related to uncertainty quantification, including prediction calibrations in image classification and semantic segmentation, active learning, and detection of out-of-distribution samples. Our empirical results show that NeuBoots outperforms other bagging based methods under a much lower computational cost without losing the validity of bootstrapping."
456,aaai,2021,Knowledge-aware Leap-LSTM: Integrating Prior Knowledge into Leap-LSTM towards Faster Long Text Classification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17511,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used in the field of natural language processing (NLP), ranging from text categorization to question answering and machine translation. However, RNNs generally read the whole text from beginning to end or vice versa sometimes, which makes it inefficient to process long texts. When reading a long document for a categorization task, such as topic categorization, large quantities of words are irrelevant and can be skipped. To this end, we propose Leap-LSTM, an LSTM-enhanced model which dynamically leaps between words while reading texts. At each step, we utilize several feature encoders to extract messages from preceding texts, following texts and the current word, and then determine whether to skip the current word. We evaluate Leap-LSTM on several text categorization tasks: sentiment analysis, news categorization, ontology classification and topic classification, with five benchmark data sets. The experimental results show that our model reads faster and predicts better than standard LSTM. Compared to previous models which can also skip words, our model achieves better trade-offs between performance and efficiency."

Video panoptic segmentation (VPS) is a recently introduced computer vision task that requires classifying and tracking every pixel in a given video. The nature of this task makes the cost of annotating datasets for it prohibiting. To understand video panoptic segmentation, first, earlier introduced constituent tasks that focus on semantics and tracking separately will be researched. Thereafter, two data-driven approaches which do not require training on a tailored VPS dataset will be selected to solve it. The first approach will show how a model for video panoptic segmentation can be built by heuristically fusing the outputs of a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and a pre-trained multi-object tracking model. This can be desired if one wants to easily extend the capabilities of either model. The second approach will counter some of the shortcomings of the first approach by building on top of a shared neural network backbone with task-specific heads. This network is designed for panoptic segmentation and will be extended by a mask propagation module to link instance masks across time, yielding the video panoptic segmentation format."
458,aaai,2021,Combinatorial Pure Exploration with Full-Bandit or Partial Linear Feedback,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16892,"In this paper, we first study the problem of combinatorial pure exploration with full-bandit feedback (CPE-BL), where a learner is given a combinatorial action space $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, and in each round the learner pulls an action $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and receives a random reward with expectation $x^{\top} \theta$, with $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$ a latent and unknown environment vector. The objective is to identify the optimal action with the highest expected reward, using as few samples as possible. For CPE-BL, we design the first {\em polynomial-time adaptive} algorithm, whose sample complexity matches the lower bound (within a logarithmic factor) for a family of instances and has a light dependence of $\Delta_{\min}$ (the smallest gap between the optimal action and sub-optimal actions). Furthermore, we propose a novel generalization of CPE-BL with flexible feedback structures, called combinatorial pure exploration with partial linear feedback (CPE-PL), which encompasses several families of sub-problems including full-bandit feedback, semi-bandit feedback, partial feedback and nonlinear reward functions. In CPE-PL, each pull of action $x$ reports a random feedback vector with expectation of $M_{x} \theta $, where $M_x \in \mathbb{R}^{m_x \times d}$ is a transformation matrix for $x$, and gains a random (possibly nonlinear) reward related to $x$. For CPE-PL, we develop the first {\em polynomial-time} algorithm, which simultaneously addresses limited feedback, general reward function and combinatorial action space, and provide its sample complexity analysis. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our algorithms run orders of magnitude faster than the existing ones, and our CPE-BL algorithm is robust across different $\Delta_{\min}$ settings while our CPE-PL algorithm is the only one returning correct answers for nonlinear reward functions."

We propose a One-Size-Fits-All solution to CBPs and present its applications to three encompassed problems, i.e. conservative multi-armed bandits (CMAB), conservative linear bandits (CLB) and conservative contextual combinatorial bandits (CCCB). Different from previous works which consider high probability constraints on the expected reward, we focus on a sample-path constraint on the actually received reward, and achieve better theoretical guarantees ($T$-independent additive regrets instead of $T$-dependent) and empirical performance. Furthermore, we extend the results and consider a novel conservative mean-variance bandit problem (MV-CBP), which measures the learning performance with both the expected reward and variability. For this extended problem, we provide a novel algorithm with $O(1/T)$ normalized additive regrets ($T$-independent in the cumulative form) and validate this result through empirical evaluation."

Our goal is to give a machine learning system similar abilities so that it can learn more efficiently. We introduce the \textit{knowledge refactoring} problem, where the goal is to restructure a learner's knowledge base to reduce its size and to minimise redundancy in it. We focus on inductive logic programming, where the knowledge base is a logic program. We introduce Knorf, a system which solves the refactoring problem using constraint optimisation. We evaluate our approach on two program induction domains: real-world string transformations and building Lego structures. Our experiments show that learning from refactored knowledge can improve predictive accuracies fourfold and reduce learning times by half."

However, social media also enables the widespread of fake news. Because of its detrimental effects brought by social media, fake news detection has attracted increasing attention. However, the performance of detecting fake news only from news content is generally limited as fake news pieces are written to mimic true news. In the real world, news pieces spread through propagation networks on social media. The news propagation networks usually involve multi-levels. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of investigating and exploiting news hierarchical propagation network on social media for fake news detection.   In an attempt to understand the correlations between news propagation networks and fake news, first, we build a hierarchical propagation network from macro-level and micro-level of fake news and true news; second, we perform a comparative analysis of the propagation network features of linguistic, structural and temporal perspectives between fake and real news, which demonstrates the potential of utilizing these features to detect fake news; third, we show the effectiveness of these propagation network features for fake news detection. We further validate the effectiveness of these features from feature important analysis. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of hierarchical propagation network and fake news and paves the way towards a healthier online news ecosystem."

Ridesharing platforms enable such sharing of rides using real-time data. Finding ride matches in real-time at urban scale is a difficult combinatorial optimization task and mostly heuristic approaches are applied. In this work, we mathematically model the problem as that of finding near-neighbors and devise a novel efficient spatio-temporal search algorithm based on the theory of locality sensitive hashing for Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). The proposed algorithm can find $k$ near-optimal potential matches for every ride from a pool of $n$ rides in time $O(n^{1 + \rho} (k + \log n) \log k)$ and space $O(n^{1 + \rho} \log k)$ for a small $\rho < 1$. Our algorithm can be extended in several useful and interesting ways increasing its practical appeal. Experiments with large NY yellow taxi trip datasets show that our algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic methods thereby proving its practical applicability."
464,aaai,2021,Semi-Supervised Metric Learning: A Deep Resurrection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16894,"Distance Metric Learning (DML) seeks to learn a discriminative embedding where similar examples are closer, and dissimilar examples are apart. In this paper, we address the problem of Semi-Supervised DML (SSDML) that tries to learn a metric using a few labeled examples, and abundantly available unlabeled examples. SSDML is important because it is infeasible to manually annotate all the examples present in a large dataset. Surprisingly, with the exception of a few classical approaches that learn a linear Mahalanobis metric, SSDML has not been studied in the recent years, and lacks approaches in the deep SSDML scenario. In this paper, we address this challenging problem, and revamp SSDML with respect to deep learning. In particular, we propose a stochastic, graph-based approach that first propagates the affinities between the pairs of examples from labeled data, to that of the unlabeled pairs. The propagated affinities are used to mine triplet based constraints for metric learning. We impose orthogonality constraint on the metric parameters, as it leads to a better performance by avoiding a model collapse."
465,aaai,2021,Recursion in Abstract Argumentation is Hard - On the Complexity of Semantics Based on Weak Admissibility,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16781,"Much like admissibility is the key concept underlying preferred semantics, strong admissibility is the key concept underlying grounded semantics, as membership of a strongly admissible set is sufficient to show membership of the grounded extension. As such, strongly admissible sets and labellings can be used as an explanation of membership of the grounded extension, as is for instance done in some of the proof procedures for grounded semantics. In the current paper, we present two polynomial algorithms for constructing relatively small strongly admissible labellings, with associated min-max numberings, for a particular argument. These labellings can be used as relatively small explanations for the argument's membership of the grounded extension. Although our algorithms are not guaranteed to yield an absolute minimal strongly admissible labelling for the argument (as doing do would have implied an exponential complexity), our best performing algorithm yields results that are only marginally bigger. Moreover, the runtime of this algorithm is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the existing approach for computing an absolute minimal strongly admissible labelling for a particular argument. As such, we believe that our algorithms can be of practical value in situations where the aim is to construct a minimal or near-minimal strongly admissible labelling in a time-efficient way."
466,aaai,2021,The Complexity Landscape of Claim-Augmented Argumentation Frameworks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16782,"We present a statistical method for complex energy landscape exploration which provides information on the metastable states--or valleys--actually explored by an unperturbed aging process following a quench. Energy fluctuations of record size are identified as the events which move the system from one valley to the next. This allows for a semi-analytical description in terms of log-Poisson statistics, whose main features are briefly explained. The bulk of the paper is devoted to thorough investigations of Ising spin glasses with Gaussian interactions of both short and long range, a well established paradigm for glassy dynamics. Simple scaling expressions with universal exponents for (a) barrier energies, (b) energy minima, and (c) the Hamming distance as a function of the valley index are found. The distribution of residence time inside valleys entered at age $t_w$ is investigated, along with the distribution of time at which the global minimum inside a valley is hit. Finally, the correlations between the minima of the landscape are presented.   The results fit well into the framework of available knowledge about spin glass aging. At the same time they support a novel interpretation of thermal relaxation in complex landscapes with multiple metastable states. The marginal stability of the attractors selected is emphasized and explained in terms of geometrical properties of the landscape."
467,aaai,2021,PoA of Simple Auctions with Interdependent Values,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16671,"We expand the literature on the price of anarchy (PoA) of simultaneous item auctions by considering settings with correlated values; we do this via the fundamental economic model of interdependent values (IDV). It is well-known that in multi-item settings with private values, correlated values can lead to bad PoA, which can be polynomially large in the number of agents $n$. In the more general model of IDV, we show that the PoA can be polynomially large even in single-item settings. On the positive side, we identify a natural condition on information dispersion in the market, termed $\gamma$-heterogeneity, which enables good PoA guarantees. Under this condition, we show that for single-item settings, the PoA of standard mechanisms degrades gracefully with $\gamma$. For settings with $m>1$ items we show a separation between two domains: If $n \geq m$, we devise a new simultaneous item auction with good PoA (with respect to $\gamma$), under limited information asymmetry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first positive PoA result for correlated values in multi-item settings. The main technical difficulty in establishing this result is that the standard tool for establishing PoA results -- the smoothness framework -- is unsuitable for IDV settings, and so we must introduce new techniques to address the unique challenges imposed by such settings. In the domain of $n \ll m$, we establish impossibility results even for surprisingly simple scenarios."
468,aaai,2021,Reinforcement Learning with Trajectory Feedback,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16895,"The standard feedback model of reinforcement learning requires revealing the reward of every visited state-action pair. However, in practice, it is often the case that such frequent feedback is not available. In this work, we take a first step towards relaxing this assumption and require a weaker form of feedback, which we refer to as \emph{trajectory feedback}. Instead of observing the reward obtained after every action, we assume we only receive a score that represents the quality of the whole trajectory observed by the agent, namely, the sum of all rewards obtained over this trajectory. We extend reinforcement learning algorithms to this setting, based on least-squares estimation of the unknown reward, for both the known and unknown transition model cases, and study the performance of these algorithms by analyzing their regret. For cases where the transition model is unknown, we offer a hybrid optimistic-Thompson Sampling approach that results in a tractable algorithm."

Specifically, given a set of incomplete d-dimensional vectors (representing rows of a matrix), the goal is to complete the missing vector entries in a way that admits a partitioning of the vectors into at most $k$ clusters with radius or diameter at most r. We give tight characterizations of the parameterized complexity of these problems with respect to the parameters k, r, and the minimum number of rows and columns needed to cover all the missing entries. We show that the considered problems are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the three parameters combined, and that dropping any of the three parameters results in parameterized intractability. A byproduct of our results is that, for the complete data setting, all problems under consideration are fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by k+r."

The study focuses on analyzing the impact of experience and learnable skills on success in the online card game. We also propose a framework to analyze online games to conclude on whether they are games of learnable skill or are they games of chance. The hypotheses proposed aim to test whether online and offline card games are comparable in terms of cognitive engagement and skill requirements. To assess these hypotheses, key elements of gameplay such as shuffling of cards, card deck randomness, and seating of players are analyzed. We also adopted statistical approaches to understand the characteristics of card games in terms of random chance or skill. From the analysis, we could see that the normality of the derived variables deviates significantly from the normal distribution showing a non-linear trend. It signifies that the mean of the involved skill variables is not zero as the user plays a greater number of games, thereby strengthening the assumption that the long-term success in online card games is attributed to skill and not chance. There is no difference in online and offline versions of card games (rummy and poker) from the perspective of requirement of skills. Moreover, our finding suggests that there is a preponderance of skills to succeed in online card gaming. Overall, the findings of this research contribute to a better understanding of cognitive skills in online gaming environments."

We completely describe semisimple, Gelfand, subtractive, and anti-bounded, CP-semirings. We give complete characterizations of congruence-simple subtractive and congruence-simple anti-bounded CP-semirings, which solve two earlier open problems for these classes of semirings. We also study in detail the properties of semimodules over Boolean algebras whose endomorphism semirings are CP-semirings; and, as a consequence of this result, we give a complete description of ideal-simple CP-semirings."

This model is suitable for modeling and forecasting variables that assume values in the interval $(0,1)$. Two of the proposed prediction intervals are based on approximations considering the normal distribution and the quantile function of the beta distribution. We also consider bootstrap-based prediction intervals, namely: (i) bootstrap prediction errors (BPE) interval; (ii) bias-corrected and acceleration (BCa) prediction interval; and (iii) percentile prediction interval based on the quantiles of the bootstrap-predicted values for two different bootstrapping schemes. The proposed prediction intervals were evaluated according to Monte Carlo simulations. The BCa prediction interval offered the best performance among the evaluated intervals, showing lower coverage rate distortion and small average length.

We describe a process -- called deliberation -- in which agents dynamically form coalitions around proposals they prefer over the status quo. We formulate conditions (on the space of proposals and on the ways in which coalitions are formed) that guarantee deliberation to succeed, that is, to terminate by identifying a majority-supported proposal with largest possible support, as long as such a proposal exists. Our results provide theoretical foundations for the analysis of deliberative processes in systems for democratic deliberation support, such as, e.g., LiquidFeedback."

This captures, for example, constraints arising from social distancing guidelines. While it is sometimes impossible to allocate a proportional share to every agent under the separation requirement, we show that the well-known criterion of maximin share fairness can always be attained. We then provide algorithmic analysis of maximin share fairness in this setting -- for instance, the maximin share of an agent cannot be computed exactly by any finite algorithm, but can be approximated with an arbitrarily small error. In addition, we consider the division of a pie (i.e., a circular cake) and show that an ordinal relaxation of maximin share fairness can be achieved. We also prove that an envy-free or equitable allocation that allocates the maximum amount of resource exists under separation."

Our main algorithms AdaACSA and AdaAGD+ are accelerated methods, which are universal in the sense that they achieve nearly-optimal convergence rates for both smooth and non-smooth functions, even when they only have access to stochastic gradients. In addition, they do not require any prior knowledge on how the objective function is parametrized, since they automatically adjust their per-coordinate learning rate. These can be seen as truly accelerated Adagrad methods for constrained optimization.   We complement them with a simpler algorithm AdaGrad+ which enjoys the same features, and achieves the standard non-accelerated convergence rate. We also present a set of new results involving adaptive methods for unconstrained optimization and monotone operators."
476,aaai,2021,Projection-Free Bandit Optimization with Privacy Guarantees,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16899,"We consider the standard $K$-armed bandit problem under a distributed trust model of differential privacy (DP), which enables to guarantee privacy without a trustworthy server. Under this trust model, previous work largely focus on achieving privacy using a shuffle protocol, where a batch of users data are randomly permuted before sending to a central server. This protocol achieves ($\epsilon,\delta$) or approximate-DP guarantee by sacrificing an additional additive $O\!\left(\!\frac{K\log T\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\epsilon}\!\right)\!$ cost in $T$-step cumulative regret. In contrast, the optimal privacy cost for achieving a stronger ($\epsilon,0$) or pure-DP guarantee under the widely used central trust model is only $\Theta\!\left(\!\frac{K\log T}{\epsilon}\!\right)\!$, where, however, a trusted server is required. In this work, we aim to obtain a pure-DP guarantee under distributed trust model while sacrificing no more regret than that under central trust model. We achieve this by designing a generic bandit algorithm based on successive arm elimination, where privacy is guaranteed by corrupting rewards with an equivalent discrete Laplace noise ensured by a secure computation protocol. We also show that our algorithm, when instantiated with Skellam noise and the secure protocol, ensures \emph{R\'{e}nyi differential privacy} -- a stronger notion than approximate DP -- under distributed trust model with a privacy cost of $O\!\left(\!\frac{K\sqrt{\log T}}{\epsilon}\!\right)\!$."
477,aaai,2021,Learning to Cascade: Confidence Calibration for Improving the Accuracy and Computational Cost of Cascade Inference Systems,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16900,"Recently, deep neural networks have become to be used in a variety of applications. While the accuracy of deep neural networks is increasing, the confidence score, which indicates the reliability of the prediction results, is becoming more important. Deep neural networks are seen as highly accurate but known to be overconfident, making it important to calibrate the confidence score. Many studies have been conducted on confidence calibration. They calibrate the confidence score of the model to match its accuracy, but it is not clear whether these confidence scores can improve the performance of systems that use confidence scores. This paper focuses on cascade inference systems, one kind of systems using confidence scores, and discusses the desired confidence score to improve system performance in terms of inference accuracy and computational cost. Based on the discussion, we propose a new confidence calibration method, Learning to Cascade. Learning to Cascade is a simple but novel method that optimizes the loss term for confidence calibration simultaneously with the original loss term. Experiments are conducted using two datasets, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, in two system settings, and show that naive application of existing calibration methods to cascade inference systems sometimes performs worse. However, Learning to Cascade always achieves a better trade-off between inference accuracy and computational cost. The simplicity of Learning to Cascade allows it to be easily applied to improve the performance of existing systems."

We prove bounds for their expected regrets that improve over the best-known regret bounds for any number of batches. In particular, our algorithms in both settings achieve the optimal expected regrets by using only a logarithmic number of batches. We also study the batched adversarial multi-armed bandit problem for the first time and find the optimal regret, up to logarithmic factors, of any algorithm with predetermined batch sizes."

One of their most attractive features con- sists in not making use of prior knowledge of the number of clusters that a dataset contains along with their shape. In this paper we propose a new algorithm named Linear DBSCAN (Lin-DBSCAN), a simple approach to clustering inspired by the density model introduced with the well known algorithm DBSCAN. Designed to minimize the computational cost of density based clustering on geospatial data, Lin-DBSCAN features a linear time complexity that makes it suitable for real-time applications on low-resource devices. Lin-DBSCAN uses a discrete version of the density model of DBSCAN that takes ad- vantage of a grid-based scan and merge approach. The name of the algorithm stems exactly from its main features outlined above. The algorithm was tested with well known data sets. Experimental results prove the efficiency and the validity of this approach over DBSCAN in the context of spatial data clustering, enabling the use of a density-based clustering technique on large datasets with low computational cost."
481,aaai,2021,Incentivizing Truthfulness Through Audits in Strategic Classification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16674,"In many societal resource allocation domains, machine learning methods are increasingly used to either score or rank agents in order to decide which ones should receive either resources (e.g., homeless services) or scrutiny (e.g., child welfare investigations) from social services agencies. An agency's scoring function typically operates on a feature vector that contains a combination of self-reported features and information available to the agency about individuals or households.This can create incentives for agents to misrepresent their self-reported features in order to receive resources or avoid scrutiny, but agencies may be able to selectively audit agents to verify the veracity of their reports.   We study the problem of optimal auditing of agents in such settings. When decisions are made using a threshold on an agent's score, the optimal audit policy has a surprisingly simple structure, uniformly auditing all agents who could benefit from lying. While this policy can, in general, be hard to compute because of the difficulty of identifying the set of agents who could benefit from lying given a complete set of reported types, we also present necessary and sufficient conditions under which it is tractable. We show that the scarce resource setting is more difficult, and exhibit an approximately optimal audit policy in this case. In addition, we show that in either setting verifying whether it is possible to incentivize exact truthfulness is hard even to approximate. However, we also exhibit sufficient conditions for solving this problem optimally, and for obtaining good approximations."

Interestingly, brain graph evolution models remain almost absent in the literature. Here we design an adversarial brain network normalizer for representing each brain network as a transformation of a fixed centered population-driven connectional template. Such graph normalization with respect to a fixed reference paves the way for reliably identifying the most similar training samples (i.e., brain graphs) to the testing sample at baseline timepoint. The testing evolution trajectory will be then spanned by the selected training graphs and their corresponding evolution trajectories. We base our prediction framework on geometric deep learning which naturally operates on graphs and nicely preserves their topological properties. Specifically, we propose the first graph-based Generative Adversarial Network (gGAN) that not only learns how to normalize brain graphs with respect to a fixed connectional brain template (CBT) (i.e., a brain template that selectively captures the most common features across a brain population) but also learns a high-order representation of the brain graphs also called embeddings. We use these embeddings to compute the similarity between training and testing subjects which allows us to pick the closest training subjects at baseline timepoint to predict the evolution of the testing brain graph over time. A series of benchmarks against several comparison methods showed that our proposed method achieved the lowest brain disease evolution prediction error using a single baseline timepoint. Our gGAN code is available at http://github.com/basiralab/gGAN."

However, the agent's behavior is usually difficult to interpret due to the introduction of black-box function, making it difficult to acquire the trust of users. Although there have been some interesting interpretation methods for vision-based RL, most of them cannot uncover temporal causal information, raising questions about their reliability. To address this problem, we present a temporal-spatial causal interpretation (TSCI) model to understand the agent's long-term behavior, which is essential for sequential decision-making. TSCI model builds on the formulation of temporal causality, which reflects the temporal causal relations between sequential observations and decisions of RL agent. Then a separate causal discovery network is employed to identify temporal-spatial causal features, which are constrained to satisfy the temporal causality. TSCI model is applicable to recurrent agents and can be used to discover causal features with high efficiency once trained. The empirical results show that TSCI model can produce high-resolution and sharp attention masks to highlight task-relevant temporal-spatial information that constitutes most evidence about how vision-based RL agents make sequential decisions. In addition, we further demonstrate that our method is able to provide valuable causal interpretations for vision-based RL agents from the temporal perspective."

As highlighted by other researchers, most of these bots have malicious purposes and tend to mimic human behavior, posing high-level security threats on OSN platforms. Moreover, recent studies have shown that social bots evolve over time by reforming and reinventing unforeseen and sophisticated characteristics, making them capable of evading the current machine learning state-of-the-art bot detection systems. This work is motivated by the critical need to establish adaptive bot detection methods in order to proactively capture unseen evolved bots towards healthier OSNs interactions. In contrast with most earlier supervised ML approaches which are limited by the inability to effectively detect new types of bots, this paper proposes CALEB, a robust end-to-end proactive framework based on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and its extension, Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN), to simulate bot evolution by creating realistic synthetic instances of different bot types. These simulated evolved bots augment existing bot datasets and therefore enhance the detection of emerging generations of bots before they even appear! Furthermore, we show that our augmentation approach overpasses other earlier augmentation techniques which fail at simulating evolving bots. Extensive experimentation on well established public bot datasets, show that our approach offers a performance boost of up to 10% regarding the detection of new unseen bots. Finally, the use of the AC-GAN Discriminator as a bot detector, has outperformed former ML approaches, showcasing the efficiency of our end to end framework."

We introduce a framework of differentially private Riemannian optimization by adding noise to the Riemannian gradient on the tangent space. The noise follows a Gaussian distribution intrinsically defined with respect to the Riemannian metric. We adapt the Gaussian mechanism from the Euclidean space to the tangent space compatible to such generalized Gaussian distribution. We show that this strategy presents a simple analysis as compared to directly adding noise on the manifold. We further show privacy guarantees of the proposed differentially private Riemannian (stochastic) gradient descent using an extension of the moments accountant technique. Additionally, we prove utility guarantees under geodesic (strongly) convex, general nonconvex objectives as well as under the Riemannian Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition.

Results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that our method can consistently match or outperform prior approaches for provable l infinity robustness.

But many of gene regulatory networks extracted from databases are static. The tumor suppressor gene $P53$ is involved in the pathogenesis of many tumors, and its inhibition effects occur after a certain period. Therefore, it is of great significance to elucidate the regulation mechanism over time points. Result:A qualitative method for representing dynamic gene regulatory network is developed, called CdtGRN. It adopts the combination of convolutional neural networks(CNN) and fully connected networks(DNN) as the core mechanism of prediction. The ionizing radiation Affymetrix dataset (E-MEXP-549) was obtained at ArrayExpress, by microarray gene expression levels predicting relations between regulation. CdtGRN is tested against a time-delayed gene regulatory network with $22,284$ genes related to $P53$. The accuracy of CdtGRN reaches 92.07$\%$ on the classification of conservative verification set, and a kappa coefficient reaches $0.84$ and an average AUC accuracy is 94.25$\%$. This resulted in the construction of. Conclusion:The algorithm and program we developed in our study would be useful for identifying dynamic gene regulatory networks, and objectively analyze the delay of the regulatory relationship by analyzing the gene expression levels at different time points.

488,aaai,2021,Learning to Reweight with Deep Interactions,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16906,"Recently, the concept of teaching has been introduced into machine learning, in which a teacher model is used to guide the training of a student model (which will be used in real tasks) through data selection, loss function design, etc. Learning to reweight, which is a specific kind of teaching that reweights training data using a teacher model, receives much attention due to its simplicity and effectiveness. In existing learning to reweight works, the teacher model only utilizes shallow/surface information such as training iteration number and loss/accuracy of the student model from training/validation sets, but ignores the internal states of the student model, which limits the potential of learning to reweight. In this work, we propose an improved data reweighting algorithm, in which the student model provides its internal states to the teacher model, and the teacher model returns adaptive weights of training samples to enhance the training of the student model. The teacher model is jointly trained with the student model using meta gradients propagated from a validation set. Experiments on image classification with clean/noisy labels and neural machine translation empirically demonstrate that our algorithm makes significant improvement over previous methods."
489,aaai,2021,Treewidth-Aware Complexity in ASP: Not all Positive Cycles are Equally Hard,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16784,"It is well-know that deciding consistency for normal answer set programs (ASP) is NP-complete, thus, as hard as the satisfaction problem for classical propositional logic (SAT). The best algorithms to solve these problems take exponential time in the worst case. The exponential time hypothesis (ETH) implies that this result is tight for SAT, that is, SAT cannot be solved in subexponential time. This immediately establishes that the result is also tight for the consistency problem for ASP. However, accounting for the treewidth of the problem, the consistency problem for ASP is slightly harder than SAT: while SAT can be solved by an algorithm that runs in exponential time in the treewidth k, it was recently shown that ASP requires exponential time in k \cdot log(k). This extra cost is due checking that there are no self-supported true atoms due to positive cycles in the program. In this paper, we refine the above result and show that the consistency problem for ASP can be solved in exponential time in k \cdot log({\lambda}) where {\lambda} is the minimum between the treewidth and the size of the largest strongly-connected component in the positive dependency graph of the program. We provide a dynamic programming algorithm that solves the problem and a treewidth-aware reduction from ASP to SAT that adhere to the above limit."

Towards effective execution strategy, recent years have witnessed the shift from the analytical view with model-based market assumptions to model-free perspective, i.e., reinforcement learning, due to its nature of sequential decision optimization. However, the noisy and yet imperfect market information that can be leveraged by the policy has made it quite challenging to build up sample efficient reinforcement learning methods to achieve effective order execution. In this paper, we propose a novel universal trading policy optimization framework to bridge the gap between the noisy yet imperfect market states and the optimal action sequences for order execution. Particularly, this framework leverages a policy distillation method that can better guide the learning of the common policy towards practically optimal execution by an oracle teacher with perfect information to approximate the optimal trading strategy. The extensive experiments have shown significant improvements of our method over various strong baselines, with reasonable trading actions."
491,aaai,2021,FILTER: An Enhanced Fusion Method for Cross-lingual Language Understanding,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17512,"Large-scale cross-lingual language models (LM), such as mBERT, Unicoder and XLM, have achieved great success in cross-lingual representation learning. However, when applied to zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks, most existing methods use only single-language input for LM finetuning, without leveraging the intrinsic cross-lingual alignment between different languages that proves essential for multilingual tasks. In this paper, we propose FILTER, an enhanced fusion method that takes cross-lingual data as input for XLM finetuning. Specifically, FILTER first encodes text input in the source language and its translation in the target language independently in the shallow layers, then performs cross-language fusion to extract multilingual knowledge in the intermediate layers, and finally performs further language-specific encoding. During inference, the model makes predictions based on the text input in the target language and its translation in the source language. For simple tasks such as classification, translated text in the target language shares the same label as the source language. However, this shared label becomes less accurate or even unavailable for more complex tasks such as question answering, NER and POS tagging. To tackle this issue, we further propose an additional KL-divergence self-teaching loss for model training, based on auto-generated soft pseudo-labels for translated text in the target language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FILTER achieves new state of the art on two challenging multilingual multi-task benchmarks, XTREME and XGLUE."

However, conventional two-stage methods are usually slow in inference. On the other hand, existing one-stage methods mainly focus on the union regions of interactions, which introduce unnecessary visual information as disturbances to HOI detection. To tackle the problems above, we propose a novel one-stage HOI detection approach DIRV in this paper, based on a new concept called interaction region for the HOI problem. Unlike previous methods, our approach concentrates on the densely sampled interaction regions across different scales for each human-object pair, so as to capture the subtle visual features that is most essential to the interaction. Moreover, in order to compensate for the detection flaws of a single interaction region, we introduce a novel voting strategy that makes full use of those overlapped interaction regions in place of conventional Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS). Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks: V-COCO and HICO-DET show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-arts by a large margin with the highest inference speed and lightest network architecture. We achieved 56.1 mAP on V-COCO without addtional input. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/DIRV"

It is challenging because an enormous number of possible combinations of objects and verbs types forms a long-tail distribution. We devise a deep Visual Compositional Learning (VCL) framework, which is a simple yet efficient framework to effectively address this problem. VCL first decomposes an HOI representation into object and verb specific features, and then composes new interaction samples in the feature space via stitching the decomposed features. The integration of decomposition and composition enables VCL to share object and verb features among different HOI samples and images, and to generate new interaction samples and new types of HOI, and thus largely alleviates the long-tail distribution problem and benefits low-shot or zero-shot HOI detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed VCL can effectively improve the generalization of HOI detection on HICO-DET and V-COCO and outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on HICO-DET.

We introduce predictive Blackwell approachability, where an estimate of the next payoff vector is given, and the decision maker tries to achieve better performance based on the accuracy of that estimator. In order to derive algorithms that achieve predictive Blackwell approachability, we start by showing a powerful connection between four well-known algorithms. Follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) and online mirror descent (OMD) are the most prevalent regret minimizers in online convex optimization. In spite of this prevalence, the regret matching (RM) and regret matching+ (RM+) algorithms have been preferred in the practice of solving large-scale games (as the local regret minimizers within the counterfactual regret minimization framework). We show that RM and RM+ are the algorithms that result from running FTRL and OMD, respectively, to select the halfspace to force at all times in the underlying Blackwell approachability game. By applying the predictive variants of FTRL or OMD to this connection, we obtain predictive Blackwell approachability algorithms, as well as predictive variants of RM and RM+. In experiments across 18 common zero-sum extensive-form benchmark games, we show that predictive RM+ coupled with counterfactual regret minimization converges vastly faster than the fastest prior algorithms (CFR+, DCFR, LCFR) across all games but two of the poker games, sometimes by two or more orders of magnitude."
495,aaai,2021,Model-Free Online Learning in Unknown Sequential Decision Making Problems and Games,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16678,"Regret minimization has proved to be a versatile tool for tree-form sequential decision making and extensive-form games. In large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games, modern extensions of counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) are currently the practical state of the art for computing a Nash equilibrium. Most regret-minimization algorithms for tree-form sequential decision making, including CFR, require (i) an exact model of the player's decision nodes, observation nodes, and how they are linked, and (ii) full knowledge, at all times t, about the payoffs -- even in parts of the decision space that are not encountered at time t. Recently, there has been growing interest towards relaxing some of those restrictions and making regret minimization applicable to settings for which reinforcement learning methods have traditionally been used -- for example, those in which only black-box access to the environment is available. We give the first, to our knowledge, regret-minimization algorithm that guarantees sublinear regret with high probability even when requirement (i) -- and thus also (ii) -- is dropped. We formalize an online learning setting in which the strategy space is not known to the agent and gets revealed incrementally whenever the agent encounters new decision points. We give an efficient algorithm that achieves $O(T^{3/4})$ regret with high probability for that setting, even when the agent faces an adversarial environment. Our experiments show it significantly outperforms the prior algorithms for the problem, which do not have such guarantees. It can be used in any application for which regret minimization is useful: approximating Nash equilibrium or quantal response equilibrium, approximating coarse correlated equilibrium in multi-player games, learning a best response, learning safe opponent exploitation, and online play against an unknown opponent/environment."

It captures the online decision-making problems that each player faces in an extensive-form game, as well as Markov decision processes and partially-observable Markov decision processes where the agent conditions on observed history. Over the past decade, there has been considerable effort into designing online optimization methods for TFSDM. Virtually all of that work has been in the full-feedback setting, where the agent has access to counterfactuals, that is, information on what would have happened had the agent chosen a different action at any decision node. Little is known about the bandit setting, where that assumption is reversed (no counterfactual information is available), despite this latter setting being well understood for almost 20 years in one-shot decision making. In this paper, we give the first algorithm for the bandit linear optimization problem for TFSDM that offers both (i) linear-time iterations (in the size of the decision tree) and (ii) $O(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret in expectation compared to any fixed strategy, at all times $T$. This is made possible by new results that we derive, which may have independent uses as well: 1) geometry of the dilated entropy regularizer, 2) autocorrelation matrix of the natural sampling scheme for sequence-form strategies, 3) construction of an unbiased estimator for linear losses for sequence-form strategies, and 4) a refined regret analysis for mirror descent when using the dilated entropy regularizer."

A registry of such incompatible donor-recipient pairs is created, and compatibility is achieved through the exchange of donors. Single-center kidney exchange registries do not have a significant pool size for achieving the full benefits of the kidney exchange program. Thus multi-registry exchange transplants seem to be a natural way forward. There are various challenges in multi-registry exchange programs, such as different constraints for each registry, varying bound on cycle lengths, and data sharing among registries. Researchers have proposed different merging mechanisms with a sequential merger, full merger with fair allocations, and full merger without any restrictions. To form a stable multi-registry sharing mechanism, registries should be individually rational both in the long run as well as in the short run. In this paper, an Integer Programming model for a multi-registry exchange program has been proposed with individual rationality constraints for each registry. A simulation study is conducted to compare the benefits of multi-registry programs with individual registry allocations on Indian data, and multiple analyses have been done. It was concluded that registries with lower arrival rates could benefit 7-9\% in terms of the number of transplants and 4-6\% in terms of quality of matches in a typical kidney exchange registry. Registry with more hard to match patients will benefit significantly larger than registries with more easy to match patients."

Network-aware recommendations have been very recently proposed as a promising solution to improve network performance. However, the idea of QoS-aware RSs has been studied from the network perspective. Its feasibility and performance performance advantages for the content-provider or user perspective have only been speculated. Hence, in this paper we aim to provide initial answers for the feasibility of the concept of QoS-aware RS, by investigating its impact on real user experience. To this end, we conduct experiments with real users on a testbed, and present initial experimental results. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of the idea: QoS-aware RSs could be beneficial for both the users (better experience) and content providers (higher user engagement). Moreover, based on the collected dataset, we build statistical models to (i) predict the user experience as a function of QoS, relevance of recommendations (QoR) and user interest, and (ii) provide useful insights for the design of QoS-aware RSs. We believe that our study is an important first step towards QoS-aware recommendations, by providing experimental evidence for their feasibility and benefits, and can help open a future research direction."

Despite this, it is common for ERM systems to follow myopic decision policies in the real world. Principled approaches to aid ERM decision-making under uncertainty have been explored but have failed to be accepted into real systems. We identify a key issue impeding their adoption --- algorithmic approaches to emergency response focus on reactive, post-incident dispatching actions, i.e. optimally dispatching a responder \textit{after} incidents occur. However, the critical nature of emergency response dictates that when an incident occurs, first responders always dispatch the closest available responder to the incident. We argue that the crucial period of planning for ERM systems is not post-incident, but between incidents. This is not a trivial planning problem --- a major challenge with dynamically balancing the spatial distribution of responders is the complexity of the problem. An orthogonal problem in ERM systems is planning under limited communication, which is particularly important in disaster scenarios that affect communication networks. We address both problems by proposing two partially decentralized multi-agent planning algorithms that utilize heuristics and exploit the structure of the dispatch problem. We evaluate our proposed approach using real-world data, and find that in several contexts, dynamic re-balancing the spatial distribution of emergency responders reduces both the average response time as well as its variance."

Despite many efforts, generating discriminative captions for images remains non-trivial. Most traditional approaches imitate the language structure patterns, thus tend to fall into a stereotype of replicating frequent phrases or sentences and neglect unique aspects of each image. In this work, we propose an image captioning framework with a self-retrieval module as training guidance, which encourages generating discriminative captions. It brings unique advantages: (1) the self-retrieval guidance can act as a metric and an evaluator of caption discriminativeness to assure the quality of generated captions. (2) The correspondence between generated captions and images are naturally incorporated in the generation process without human annotations, and hence our approach could utilize a large amount of unlabeled images to boost captioning performance with no additional laborious annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed retrieval-guided method on COCO and Flickr30k captioning datasets, and show its superior captioning performance with more discriminative captions."

The problem is both fundamental and interesting, as most machine-generated captions, despite phenomenal research progresses in the past several years, are expressed in a very monotonic and featureless format. While such captions are normally accurate, they often lack important characteristics in human languages - distinctiveness for each caption and diversity for different images. To address this problem, we propose a novel conditional generative adversarial network for generating diverse captions across images. Instead of estimating the quality of a caption solely on one image, the proposed comparative adversarial learning framework better assesses the quality of captions by comparing a set of captions within the image-caption joint space. By contrasting with human-written captions and image-mismatched captions, the caption generator effectively exploits the inherent characteristics of human languages, and generates more discriminative captions. We show that our proposed network is capable of producing accurate and diverse captions across images."

In a typical experiment, proteins in a sample are first broken into their constituent peptides. The resulting mixture of peptides is then subjected to mass spectrometry, which generates thousands of spectra, each characteristic of its generating peptide. Here we consider the problem of inferring, from these spectra, which proteins and peptides are present in the sample. We develop a statistical approach to the problem, based on a nested mixture model. In contrast to commonly used two-stage approaches, this model provides a one-stage solution that simultaneously identifies which proteins are present, and which peptides are correctly identified. In this way our model incorporates the evidence feedback between proteins and their constituent peptides. Using simulated data and a yeast data set, we compare and contrast our method with existing widely used approaches (PeptideProphet/ProteinProphet) and with a recently published new approach, HSM. For peptide identification, our single-stage approach yields consistently more accurate results. For protein identification the methods have similar accuracy in most settings, although we exhibit some scenarios in which the existing methods perform poorly."
504,aaai,2021,Simultaneous 2nd Price Item Auctions with No-Underbidding,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16679,"The literature on the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of simple auctions employs a no-overbidding assumption but has completely overlooked the no-underbidding phenomenon, which is evident in empirical studies on variants of the second price auction. In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for the no-underbidding phenomenon. We study the PoA of simultaneous 2nd price auctions (S2PA) under a new natural condition of {\em no underbidding}, meaning that agents never bid on items less than their marginal values. We establish improved (mostly tight) bounds on the PoA of S2PA under no underbidding for different valuation classes (including unit-demand, submodular, XOS, subadditive, and general monotone valuations), in both full-information and incomplete information settings.   To derive our results, we introduce a new parameterized property of auctions, termed $(\gamma,\delta)$-revenue guaranteed, which implies a PoA of at least $\gamma/(1+\delta)$. Via extension theorems, this guarantee extends to coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) in full information settings, and to Bayesian PoA (BPoA) in settings with incomplete information and arbitrary (correlated) distributions. We then show that S2PA are $(1,1)$-revenue guaranteed with respect to bids satisfying no underbidding. This implies a PoA of at least $1/2$ for general monotone valuation, which extends to BPOA with arbitrary correlated distributions. Moreover, we show that $(\lambda,\mu)$-smoothness combined with $(\gamma,\delta)$-revenue guaranteed guarantees a PoA of at least $(\gamma+\lambda)/(1+\delta+\mu)$. This implies a host of results, such as a tight PoA of $2/3$ for S2PA with submodular (or XOS) valuations, under no overbidding and no underbidding. Beyond establishing improved bounds for S2PA, the no underbidding assumption sheds new light on the performance of S2PA relative to simultaneous 1st price auctions."

The model trades off between expressiveness and the possibility of supporting parameterized verification of safety properties on top of it. Specifically, taking inspiration from the literature on verification of artifact systems, we study verification problems where safety properties are checked irrespectively of the content of the read-only catalog, and accepting the potential presence of unboundedly many tuples in the catalog and repository. We tackle such problems using an array-based backward reachability procedure fully implemented in MCMT -- a state-of-the-art array-based SMT model checker. Notably, we prove that the procedure is sound and complete for checking safety of DABs, and single out additional conditions that guarantee its termination and, in turn, show decidability of checking safety."
506,aaai,2021,Multi-Objective Submodular Maximization by Regret Ratio Minimization with Theoretical Guarantee,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17460,"In this paper, we study fundamental problems of maximizing DR-submodular continuous functions that have real-world applications in the domain of machine learning, economics, operations research and communication systems. It captures a subclass of non-convex optimization that provides both theoretical and practical guarantees. Here, we focus on minimizing regret for online arriving non-monotone DR-submodular functions over different types of convex sets: hypercube, down-closed and general convex sets.   First, we present an online algorithm that achieves a $1/e$-approximation ratio with the regret of $O(T^{2/3})$ for maximizing DR-submodular functions over any down-closed convex set. Note that, the approximation ratio of $1/e$ matches the best-known guarantee for the offline version of the problem. Moreover, when the convex set is the hypercube, we propose a tight 1/2-approximation algorithm with regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Next, we give an online algorithm that achieves an approximation guarantee (depending on the search space) for the problem of maximizing non-monotone continuous DR-submodular functions over a \emph{general} convex set (not necessarily down-closed). To best of our knowledge, no prior algorithm with approximation guarantee was known for non-monotone DR-submodular maximization in the online setting. Finally we run experiments to verify the performance of our algorithms on problems arising in machine learning domain with the real-world datasets."

In this paper, we provided a new solution to improve automated collaborative learning analyses using deep neural networks. Instead of using self-reported questionnaires, which are subject to bias and noise, we automatically extract group-working information by object recognition results using Mask R-CNN method. This process is based on detecting the people and other objects from pictures and video clips of the collaborative learning process, then evaluate the mobile learning performance using the collaborative indicators. We tested our approach to automatically evaluate the group-work collaboration in a controlled study of thirty-three dyads while performing an anatomy body painting intervention. The results indicate that our approach recognizes the differences of collaborations among teams of treatment and control groups in the case study. This work introduces new methods for automated quality prediction of collaborations among human-human interactions using computer vision techniques."

This recognition mechanism and underlying generalization capability seem to contrast to state-of-the-art image segmentation networks that rely on large-scale category-aware annotated training samples. In this paper, we make an attempt towards building models that explicitly account for visual boundary knowledge, in hope to reduce the training effort on segmenting unseen categories. Specifically, we investigate a new task termed as Boundary Knowledge Translation (BKT). Given a set of fully labeled categories, BKT aims to translate the visual boundary knowledge learned from the labeled categories, to a set of novel categories, each of which is provided only a few labeled samples. To this end, we propose a Translation Segmentation Network (Trans-Net), which comprises a segmentation network and two boundary discriminators. The segmentation network, combined with a boundary-aware self-supervised mechanism, is devised to conduct foreground segmentation, while the two discriminators work together in an adversarial manner to ensure an accurate segmentation of the novel categories under light supervision. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with only tens of labeled samples as guidance, Trans-Net achieves close results on par with fully supervised methods."

In this paper, we investigate and propose two causes of this problem: (1) The ELBO objective cannot utilize the label information directly. (2) A bottleneck value exists and continuing to optimize ELBO after this value will not improve inference accuracy. On the basis of the experiment results, we propose SHOT-VAE to address these problems without introducing additional prior knowledge. The SHOT-VAE offers two contributions: (1) A new ELBO approximation named smooth-ELBO that integrates the label predictive loss into ELBO. (2) An approximation based on optimal interpolation that breaks the ELBO value bottleneck by reducing the margin between ELBO and the data likelihood. The SHOT-VAE achieves good performance with a 25.30% error rate on CIFAR-100 with 10k labels and reduces the error rate to 6.11% on CIFAR-10 with 4k labels."
510,aaai,2021,Learning to Augment for Data-scarce Domain BERT Knowledge Distillation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16910,"Despite pre-trained language models such as BERT have achieved appealing performance in a wide range of natural language processing tasks, they are computationally expensive to be deployed in real-time applications. A typical method is to adopt knowledge distillation to compress these large pre-trained models (teacher models) to small student models. However, for a target domain with scarce training data, the teacher can hardly pass useful knowledge to the student, which yields performance degradation for the student models. To tackle this problem, we propose a method to learn to augment for data-scarce domain BERT knowledge distillation, by learning a cross-domain manipulation scheme that automatically augments the target with the help of resource-rich source domains. Specifically, the proposed method generates samples acquired from a stationary distribution near the target data and adopts a reinforced selector to automatically refine the augmentation strategy according to the performance of the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four different tasks, and for the data-scarce domains, the compressed student models even perform better than the original large teacher model, with much fewer parameters (only ${\sim}13.3\%$) when only a few labeled examples available."
511,aaai,2021,Multi-View Feature Representation for Dialogue Generation with Bidirectional Distillation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17516,"Neural dialogue models suffer from low-quality responses when interacted in practice, demonstrating difficulty in generalization beyond training data. Recently, knowledge distillation has been used to successfully regularize the student by transferring knowledge from the teacher. However, the teacher and the student are trained on the same dataset and tend to learn similar feature representations, whereas the most general knowledge should be found through differences. The finding of general knowledge is further hindered by the unidirectional distillation, as the student should obey the teacher and may discard some knowledge that is truly general but refuted by the teacher. To this end, we propose a novel training framework, where the learning of general knowledge is more in line with the idea of reaching consensus, i.e., finding common knowledge that is beneficial to different yet all datasets through diversified learning partners. Concretely, the training task is divided into a group of subtasks with the same number of students. Each student assigned to one subtask not only is optimized on the allocated subtask but also imitates multi-view feature representation aggregated from other students (i.e., student peers), which induces students to capture common knowledge among different subtasks and alleviates the over-fitting of students on the allocated subtasks. To further enhance generalization, we extend the unidirectional distillation to the bidirectional distillation that encourages the student and its student peers to co-evolve by exchanging complementary knowledge with each other. Empirical results and analysis demonstrate that our training framework effectively improves the model generalization without sacrificing training efficiency."
512,aaai,2021,UAG: Uncertainty-aware Attention Graph Neural Network for Defending Adversarial Attacks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16908,"With the increasing popularity of graph-based learning, graph neural networks (GNNs) emerge as the essential tool for gaining insights from graphs. However, unlike the conventional CNNs that have been extensively explored and exhaustively tested, people are still worrying about the GNNs' robustness under the critical settings, such as financial services. The main reason is that existing GNNs usually serve as a black-box in predicting and do not provide the uncertainty on the predictions. On the other side, the recent advancement of Bayesian deep learning on CNNs has demonstrated its success of quantifying and explaining such uncertainties to fortify CNN models. Motivated by these observations, we propose UAG, the first systematic solution to defend adversarial attacks on GNNs through identifying and exploiting hierarchical uncertainties in GNNs. UAG develops a Bayesian Uncertainty Technique (BUT) to explicitly capture uncertainties in GNNs and further employs an Uncertainty-aware Attention Technique (UAT) to defend adversarial attacks on GNNs. Intensive experiments show that our proposed defense approach outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by a significant margin."

The diagnosis of MVI needs discovering the vessels that contain hepatocellular carcinoma cells and counting their number in each vessel, which depends heavily on experiences of the doctor, is largely subjective and time-consuming. However, there is no algorithm as yet tailored for the MVI detection from pathological images. This paper collects the first pathological liver image dataset containing 522 whole slide images with labels of vessels, MVI, and hepatocellular carcinoma grades. The first and essential step for the automatic diagnosis of MVI is the accurate segmentation of vessels. The unique characteristics of pathological liver images, such as super-large size, multi-scale vessel, and blurred vessel edges, make the accurate vessel segmentation challenging. Based on the collected dataset, we propose an Edge-competing Vessel Segmentation Network (EVS-Net), which contains a segmentation network and two edge segmentation discriminators. The segmentation network, combined with an edge-aware self-supervision mechanism, is devised to conduct vessel segmentation with limited labeled patches. Meanwhile, two discriminators are introduced to distinguish whether the segmented vessel and background contain residual features in an adversarial manner. In the training stage, two discriminators are devised tocompete for the predicted position of edges. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with only limited labeled patches, EVS-Net achieves a close performance of fully supervised methods, which provides a convenient tool for the pathological liver vessel segmentation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zju-vipa/EVS-Net."

In this paper, we propose the Dual-Octave Convolution (Dual-OctConv), which is capable of learning multi-scale spatial-frequency features from both real and imaginary components, for fast parallel MR image reconstruction. By reformulating the complex operations using octave convolutions, our model shows a strong ability to capture richer representations of MR images, while at the same time greatly reducing the spatial redundancy. More specifically, the input feature maps and convolutional kernels are first split into two components (i.e., real and imaginary), which are then divided into four groups according to their spatial frequencies. Then, our Dual-OctConv conducts intra-group information updating and inter-group information exchange to aggregate the contextual information across different groups. Our framework provides two appealing benefits: (i) it encourages interactions between real and imaginary components at various spatial frequencies to achieve richer representational capacity, and (ii) it enlarges the receptive field by learning multiple spatial-frequency features of both the real and imaginary components. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on the acceleration of multi-coil MR image reconstruction. Extensive experiments are conducted on an {in vivo} knee dataset under different undersampling patterns and acceleration factors. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model in accelerated parallel MR image reconstruction. Our code is available at: github.com/chunmeifeng/Dual-OctConv."

The adaptation logic often describes the adaptation by using runtime models representing the underlying software and steps such as analysis and planning that operate on these runtime models. To systematically address this interplay, runtime megamodels, which are specific runtime models that have themselves runtime models as their elements and that also capture the relationships between multiple runtime models, have been proposed. In this paper, we go one step further and present a modeling language for runtime megamodels that considerably eases the development of the adaptation logic by providing a domain-specific modeling approach and a runtime interpreter for this part of a self-adaptive system. This supports development by modeling the feedback loops explicitly and at a higher level of abstraction. Moreover, it permits to build complex solutions where multiple feedback loops interact or operate on top of each other, which is leveraged by keeping the megamodels explicit and alive at runtime and by interpreting them."

This may require opening a drawer to observe its contents or moving an object out of the way to examine the space behind it. Upon receiving a new observation, the robot must update its belief about the world and compute a new plan of action. In this work, we present an online planning and execution system for robots faced with these challenges. We perform deterministic cost-sensitive planning in the space of hybrid belief states to select likely-to-succeed observation actions and continuous control actions. After execution and observation, we replan using our new state estimate. We initially enforce that planner reuses the structure of the unexecuted tail of the last plan. This both improves planning efficiency and ensures that the overall policy does not undo its progress towards achieving the goal. Our approach is able to efficiently solve partially observable problems both in simulation and in a real-world kitchen."
518,aaai,2021,Practical and Rigorous Uncertainty Bounds for Gaussian Process Regression,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16912,"Gaussian Process Regression is a popular nonparametric regression method based on Bayesian principles that provides uncertainty estimates for its predictions. However, these estimates are of a Bayesian nature, whereas for some important applications, like learning-based control with safety guarantees, frequentist uncertainty bounds are required. Although such rigorous bounds are available for Gaussian Processes, they are too conservative to be useful in applications. This often leads practitioners to replacing these bounds by heuristics, thus breaking all theoretical guarantees. To address this problem, we introduce new uncertainty bounds that are rigorous, yet practically useful at the same time. In particular, the bounds can be explicitly evaluated and are much less conservative than state of the art results. Furthermore, we show that certain model misspecifications lead to only graceful degradation. We demonstrate these advantages and the usefulness of our results for learning-based control with numerical examples."

The model jointly learns to locate the human joints in the image, to estimate their 3D coordinates and to group these predictions into full human skeletons. The proposed method deals with a variable number of people and does not need bounding boxes to estimate the 3D poses. It leverages and extends the Stacked Hourglass Network and its multi-scale feature learning to manage multi-person situations. Thus, we exploit a robust 3D human pose formulation to fully describe several 3D human poses even in case of strong occlusions or crops. Then, joint grouping and human pose estimation for an arbitrary number of people are performed using the associative embedding method. Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on the challenging CMU Panoptic and a previous single shot method on the MuPoTS-3D dataset. Furthermore, it leads to good results on the complex and synthetic images from the newly proposed JTA Dataset."

We show that under some assumptions usual in this literature, with an even number of voters if the core of the voting situation is singleton (and in the interior of the policy space) then the element in the core is never a Condorcet winner. This is in sharp contrast with what happens with an odd number of voters: in that case, under identical assumptions, it is well known that if the core of the voting situation is non-empty then the single element in the core is the Condorcet winner as well."

How to control the intensity of accent in the process of TTS is a very interesting research direction, and has attracted more and more attention. Recent work design a speaker-adversarial loss to disentangle the speaker and accent information, and then adjust the loss weight to control the accent intensity. However, such a control method lacks interpretability, and there is no direct correlation between the controlling factor and natural accent intensity. To this end, this paper propose a new intuitive and explicit accent intensity control scheme for accented TTS. Specifically, we first extract the posterior probability, called as ``goodness of pronunciation (GoP)'' from the L1 speech recognition model to quantify the phoneme accent intensity for accented speech, then design a FastSpeech2 based TTS model, named Ai-TTS, to take the accent intensity expression into account during speech generation. Experiments show that the our method outperforms the baseline model in terms of accent rendering and intensity control."

This paper introduces a framework of personalized optimization to han- dle such problems. Unlike traditional robust optimization, personalized optimization devotes to finding a series of optimal control variables for different values of environmental variables. Therefore, the solution from personalized optimization consists of optimal surfaces defined on the domain of the environmental variables. When the environmental variables can be observed or measured, personalized optimization yields more reasonable and better solution- s than robust optimization. The implementation of personalized optimization for complex computer models is discussed. Based on statistical modeling of computer experiments, we provide two algorithms to sequentially design input values for approximating the optimal surfaces. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of our algorithms."

While GAN generated levels are stylistically similar to human-authored examples, human designers often want to explore the generative design space of GANs to extract interesting levels. However, human designers find latent vectors opaque and would rather explore along dimensions the designer specifies, such as number of enemies or obstacles. We propose using state-of-the-art quality diversity algorithms designed to optimize continuous spaces, i.e. MAP-Elites with a directional variation operator and Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites, to efficiently explore the latent space of a GAN to extract levels that vary across a set of specified gameplay measures. In the benchmark domain of Super Mario Bros, we demonstrate how designers may specify gameplay measures to our system and extract high-quality (playable) levels with a diverse range of level mechanics, while still maintaining stylistic similarity to human authored examples. An online user study shows how the different mechanics of the automatically generated levels affect subjective ratings of their perceived difficulty and appearance."

Two of the most widely used sampling schemes are subgraph sampling, where we sample each vertex independently with probability $p$ and observe the subgraph induced by the sampled vertices, and neighborhood sampling, where we additionally observe the edges between the sampled vertices and their neighbors.   In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the number of motifs as induced subgraphs under both models from a statistical perspective. We show that: for any connected $h$ on $k$ vertices, to estimate $s=\mathsf{s}(h,G)$, the number of copies of $h$ in the parent graph $G$ of maximum degree $d$, with a multiplicative error of $\epsilon$, (a) For subgraph sampling, the optimal sampling ratio $p$ is $\Theta_{k}(\max\{ (s\epsilon^2)^{-\frac{1}{k}}, \; \frac{d^{k-1}}{s\epsilon^{2}} \})$, achieved by Horvitz-Thompson type of estimators. (b) For neighborhood sampling, we propose a family of estimators, encompassing and outperforming the Horvitz-Thompson estimator and achieving the sampling ratio $O_{k}(\min\{ (\frac{d}{s\epsilon^2})^{\frac{1}{k-1}}, \; \sqrt{\frac{d^{k-2}}{s\epsilon^2}}\})$. This is shown to be optimal for all motifs with at most $4$ vertices and cliques of all sizes.   The matching minimax lower bounds are established using certain algebraic properties of subgraph counts. These results quantify how much more informative neighborhood sampling is than subgraph sampling, as empirically verified by experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. We also address the issue of adaptation to the unknown maximum degree, and study specific problems for parent graphs with additional structures, e.g., trees or planar graphs."
526,aaai,2021,Learning General Planning Policies from Small Examples Without Supervision,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17402,"Generalized planning is concerned with the computation of general policies that solve multiple instances of a planning domain all at once. It has been recently shown that these policies can be computed in two steps: first, a suitable abstraction in the form of a qualitative numerical planning problem (QNP) is learned from sample plans, then the general policies are obtained from the learned QNP using a planner. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach for computing more expressive general policies which does not require sample plans or a QNP planner. The new formulation is very simple and can be cast in terms that are more standard in machine learning: a large but finite pool of features is defined from the predicates in the planning examples using a general grammar, and a small subset of features is sought for separating ""good"" from ""bad"" state transitions, and goals from non-goals. The problems of finding such a ""separating surface"" while labeling the transitions as ""good"" or ""bad"" are jointly addressed as a single combinatorial optimization problem expressed as a Weighted Max-SAT problem. The advantage of looking for the simplest policy in the given feature space that solves the given examples, possibly non-optimally, is that many domains have no general, compact policies that are optimal. The approach yields general policies for a number of benchmark domains."

The study focuses on analyzing the impact of experience and learnable skills on success in the online card game. We also propose a framework to analyze online games to conclude on whether they are games of learnable skill or are they games of chance. The hypotheses proposed aim to test whether online and offline card games are comparable in terms of cognitive engagement and skill requirements. To assess these hypotheses, key elements of gameplay such as shuffling of cards, card deck randomness, and seating of players are analyzed. We also adopted statistical approaches to understand the characteristics of card games in terms of random chance or skill. From the analysis, we could see that the normality of the derived variables deviates significantly from the normal distribution showing a non-linear trend. It signifies that the mean of the involved skill variables is not zero as the user plays a greater number of games, thereby strengthening the assumption that the long-term success in online card games is attributed to skill and not chance. There is no difference in online and offline versions of card games (rummy and poker) from the perspective of requirement of skills. Moreover, our finding suggests that there is a preponderance of skills to succeed in online card gaming. Overall, the findings of this research contribute to a better understanding of cognitive skills in online gaming environments."

Common approaches have taken the form of meta-learning: learning to learn on the new problem given the old. Following the recognition that meta-learning is implementing learning in a multi-level model, we present a Bayesian treatment for the meta-learning inner loop through the use of deep kernels. As a result we can learn a kernel that transfers to new tasks; we call this Deep Kernel Transfer (DKT). This approach has many advantages: is straightforward to implement as a single optimizer, provides uncertainty quantification, and does not require estimation of task-specific parameters. We empirically demonstrate that DKT outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in few-shot classification, and is the state of the art for cross-domain adaptation and regression. We conclude that complex meta-learning routines can be replaced by a simpler Bayesian model without loss of accuracy."

It needs to address two mutually exclusive objectives: removing rain streaks and reserving realistic details. Balancing them is critical for de-raining methods. We propose an end-to-end network, called dual-task de-raining network (DTDN), consisting of two sub-networks: generative adversarial network (GAN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), to remove rain streaks via coordinating the two mutually exclusive objectives self-adaptively. DTDN-GAN is mainly used to remove structural rain streaks, and DTDN-CNN is designed to recover details in original images. We also design a training algorithm to train these two sub-networks of DTDN alternatively, which share same weights but use different training sets. We further enrich two existing datasets to approximate the distribution of real rain streaks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several recent state-of-the-art methods, based on both benchmark testing datasets and real rainy images."

In this letter, we explore a data-driven approach to account for environmental lighting changes, improving the quality of images for use in visual odometry (VO) or visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We train a deep convolutional neural network model to predictively adjust camera gain and exposure time parameters such that consecutive images contain a maximal number of matchable features. The training process is fully self-supervised: our training signal is derived from an underlying VO or SLAM pipeline and, as a result, the model is optimized to perform well with that specific pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive real-world experiments that our network can anticipate and compensate for dramatic lighting changes (e.g., transitions into and out of road tunnels), maintaining a substantially higher number of inlier feature matches than competing camera parameter control algorithms."
532,aaai,2021,A Theoretical Analysis of the Repetition Problem in Text Generation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17520,"Text generation tasks, including translation, summarization, language models, and etc. see rapid growth during recent years. Despite the remarkable achievements, the repetition problem has been observed in nearly all text generation models undermining the generation performance extensively. To solve the repetition problem, many methods have been proposed, but there is no existing theoretical analysis to show why this problem happens and how it is resolved. In this paper, we propose a new framework for theoretical analysis for the repetition problem. We first define the Average Repetition Probability (ARP) to characterize the repetition problem quantitatively. Then, we conduct an extensive analysis of the Markov generation model and derive several upper bounds of the average repetition probability with intuitive understanding. We show that most of the existing methods are essentially minimizing the upper bounds explicitly or implicitly. Grounded on our theory, we show that the repetition problem is, unfortunately, caused by the traits of our language itself. One major reason is attributed to the fact that there exist too many words predicting the same word as the subsequent word with high probability. Consequently, it is easy to go back to that word and form repetitions and we dub it as the high inflow problem. Furthermore, we derive a concentration bound of the average repetition probability for a general generation model. Finally, based on the theoretical upper bounds, we propose a novel rebalanced encoding approach to alleviate the high inflow problem. The experimental results show that our theoretical framework is applicable in general generation models and our proposed rebalanced encoding approach alleviates the repetition problem significantly.

533,aaai,2021,Generalize a Small Pre-trained Model to Arbitrarily Large TSP Instances,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16916,"For the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the existing supervised learning based algorithms suffer seriously from the lack of generalization ability. To overcome this drawback, this paper tries to train (in supervised manner) a small-scale model, which could be repetitively used to build heat maps for TSP instances of arbitrarily large size, based on a series of techniques such as graph sampling, graph converting and heat maps merging. Furthermore, the heat maps are fed into a reinforcement learning approach (Monte Carlo tree search), to guide the search of high-quality solutions. Experimental results based on a large number of instances (with up to 10,000 vertices) show that, this new approach clearly outperforms the existing machine learning based TSP algorithms, and significantly improves the generalization ability of the trained model."
534,aaai,2021,Nested Named Entity Recognition with Partially-Observed TreeCRFs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17519,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a well-studied task in natural language processing. However, the widely-used sequence labeling framework is difficult to detect entities with nested structures. In this work, we view nested NER as constituency parsing with partially-observed trees and model it with partially-observed TreeCRFs. Specifically, we view all labeled entity spans as observed nodes in a constituency tree, and other spans as latent nodes. With the TreeCRF we achieve a uniform way to jointly model the observed and the latent nodes. To compute the probability of partial trees with partial marginalization, we propose a variant of the Inside algorithm, the \textsc{Masked Inside} algorithm, that supports different inference operations for different nodes (evaluation for the observed, marginalization for the latent, and rejection for nodes incompatible with the observed) with efficient parallelized implementation, thus significantly speeding up training and inference. Experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) F1 scores on the ACE2004, ACE2005 dataset, and shows comparable performance to SOTA models on the GENIA dataset. Our approach is implemented at: \url{https://github.com/FranxYao/Partially-Observed-TreeCRFs}."
535,aaai,2021,Towards Effective Context for Meta-Reinforcement Learning: an Approach based on Contrastive Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i8.16914,"Detecting anomalies in temporal data is challenging due to anomalies being dependent on temporal dynamics. One-class classification methods are commonly used for anomaly detection tasks, but they have limitations when applied to temporal data. In particular, mapping all normal instances into a single hypersphere to capture their global characteristics can lead to poor performance in detecting context-based anomalies where the abnormality is defined with respect to local information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach inspired by the loss function of DeepSVDD. Instead of mapping all normal instances into a single hypersphere center, each normal instance is pulled toward a recent context window. However, this approach is prone to a representation collapse issue where the neural network that encodes a given instance and its context is optimized towards a constant encoder solution. To overcome this problem, we combine our approach with a deterministic contrastive loss from Neutral AD, a promising self-supervised learning anomaly detection approach. We provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the incorporation of the deterministic contrastive loss can effectively prevent the occurrence of a constant encoder solution. Experimental results show superior performance of our model over various baselines and model variants on real-world industrial datasets."
536,aaai,2021,Predicting Flashover Occurrence using Surrogate Temperature Data,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17736,"A flashover occurs when a fire spreads very rapidly through crevices due to intense heat. Flashovers present one of the most frightening and challenging fire phenomena to those who regularly encounter them: firefighters. Firefighters' safety and lives often depend on their ability to predict flashovers before they occur. Typical pre-flashover fire characteristics include dark smoke, high heat, and rollover (""angel fingers"") and can be quantified by color, size, and shape. Using a color video stream from a firefighter's body camera, we applied generative adversarial neural networks for image enhancement. The neural networks were trained to enhance very dark fire and smoke patterns in videos and monitor dynamic changes in smoke and fire areas. Preliminary tests with limited flashover training videos showed that we predicted a flashover as early as 55 seconds before it occurred."

Existing generative models and reinforcement learning approaches made initial success, but still face difficulties in simultaneously optimizing multiple drug properties. To address such challenges, we propose the MultI-constraint MOlecule SAmpling (MIMOSA) approach, a sampling framework to use input molecule as an initial guess and sample molecules from the target distribution. MIMOSA first pretrains two property agnostic graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecule topology and substructure-type prediction, where a substructure can be either atom or single ring. For each iteration, MIMOSA uses the GNNs' prediction and employs three basic substructure operations (add, replace, delete) to generate new molecules and associated weights. The weights can encode multiple constraints including similarity and drug property constraints, upon which we select promising molecules for next iteration. MIMOSA enables flexible encoding of multiple property- and similarity-constraints and can efficiently generate new molecules that satisfy various property constraints and achieved up to 49.6% relative improvement over the best baseline in terms of success rate. The code repository (including readme file, data preprocessing and model construction, evaluation) is available https://github.com/futianfan/MIMOSA."
538,aaai,2021,CompFeat: Comprehensive Feature Aggregation for Video Instance Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16225,"Modern one-stage video instance segmentation networks suffer from two limitations. First, convolutional features are neither aligned with anchor boxes nor with ground-truth bounding boxes, reducing the mask sensitivity to spatial location. Second, a video is directly divided into individual frames for frame-level instance segmentation, ignoring the temporal correlation between adjacent frames. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective one-stage video instance segmentation framework by spatial calibration and temporal fusion, namely STMask. To ensure spatial feature calibration with ground-truth bounding boxes, we first predict regressed bounding boxes around ground-truth bounding boxes, and extract features from them for frame-level instance segmentation. To further explore temporal correlation among video frames, we aggregate a temporal fusion module to infer instance masks from each frame to its adjacent frames, which helps our framework to handle challenging videos such as motion blur, partial occlusion and unusual object-to-camera poses. Experiments on the YouTube-VIS valid set show that the proposed STMask with ResNet-50/-101 backbone obtains 33.5 % / 36.8 % mask AP, while achieving 28.6 / 23.4 FPS on video instance segmentation. The code is released online https://github.com/MinghanLi/STMask."

Most existing works take a two-stage strategy that first generates region proposals and then detects objects of interest, where adversarial learning is widely adopted to mitigate the inter-domain discrepancy in both stages. However, adversarial learning may impair the alignment of well-aligned samples as it merely aligns the global distributions across domains. To address this issue, we design an uncertainty-aware domain adaptation network (UaDAN) that introduces conditional adversarial learning to align well-aligned and poorly-aligned samples separately in different manners. Specifically, we design an uncertainty metric that assesses the alignment of each sample and adjusts the strength of adversarial learning for well-aligned and poorly-aligned samples adaptively. In addition, we exploit the uncertainty metric to achieve curriculum learning that first performs easier image-level alignment and then more difficult instance-level alignment progressively. Extensive experiments over four challenging domain adaptive object detection datasets show that UaDAN achieves superior performance as compared with state-of-the-art methods."

However, a large number of parameters need significant amounts of memory and the consumption of inference time, which makes it difficult to deploy them on edge devices. In this work, we propose a knowledge distillation method LRC-BERT based on contrastive learning to fit the output of the intermediate layer from the angular distance aspect, which is not considered by the existing distillation methods. Furthermore, we introduce a gradient perturbation-based training architecture in the training phase to increase the robustness of LRC-BERT, which is the first attempt in knowledge distillation. Additionally, in order to better capture the distribution characteristics of the intermediate layer, we design a two-stage training method for the total distillation loss. Finally, by verifying 8 datasets on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, the performance of the proposed LRC-BERT exceeds the existing state-of-the-art methods, which proves the effectiveness of our method."
541,aaai,2021,Paragraph-level Commonsense Transformers with Recurrent Memory,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17521,"Human understanding of narrative texts requires making commonsense inferences beyond what is stated explicitly in the text. A recent model, COMET, can generate such implicit commonsense inferences along several dimensions such as pre- and post-conditions, motivations, and mental states of the participants. However, COMET was trained on commonsense inferences of short phrases, and is therefore discourse-agnostic. When presented with each sentence of a multi-sentence narrative, it might generate inferences that are inconsistent with the rest of the narrative.   We present the task of discourse-aware commonsense inference. Given a sentence within a narrative, the goal is to generate commonsense inferences along predefined dimensions, while maintaining coherence with the rest of the narrative. Such large-scale paragraph-level annotation is hard to get and costly, so we use available sentence-level annotations to efficiently and automatically construct a distantly supervised corpus.   Using this corpus, we train PARA-COMET, a discourse-aware model that incorporates paragraph-level information to generate coherent commonsense inferences from narratives. PARA-COMET captures both semantic knowledge pertaining to prior world knowledge, and episodic knowledge involving how current events relate to prior and future events in a narrative. Our results show that PARA-COMET outperforms the sentence-level baselines, particularly in generating inferences that are both coherent and novel."

The study focuses on analyzing the impact of experience and learnable skills on success in the online card game. We also propose a framework to analyze online games to conclude on whether they are games of learnable skill or are they games of chance. The hypotheses proposed aim to test whether online and offline card games are comparable in terms of cognitive engagement and skill requirements. To assess these hypotheses, key elements of gameplay such as shuffling of cards, card deck randomness, and seating of players are analyzed. We also adopted statistical approaches to understand the characteristics of card games in terms of random chance or skill. From the analysis, we could see that the normality of the derived variables deviates significantly from the normal distribution showing a non-linear trend. It signifies that the mean of the involved skill variables is not zero as the user plays a greater number of games, thereby strengthening the assumption that the long-term success in online card games is attributed to skill and not chance. There is no difference in online and offline versions of card games (rummy and poker) from the perspective of requirement of skills. Moreover, our finding suggests that there is a preponderance of skills to succeed in online card gaming. Overall, the findings of this research contribute to a better understanding of cognitive skills in online gaming environments."

Therefore, the problem of missing data is a crucial and unavoidable issue in the analysis and modeling of real-world social networks. However, most of the research on different aspects of social networks does not consider this limitation. One effective way to solve this problem is to recover the missing data as a pre-processing step. In this paper, a model is learned from partially observed data to infer unobserved diffusion and structure networks. To jointly discover omitted diffusion activities and hidden network structures, we develop a probabilistic generative model called ""DiffStru."" The interrelations among links of nodes and cascade processes are utilized in the proposed method via learning coupled with low-dimensional latent factors. Besides inferring unseen data, latent factors such as community detection may also aid in network classification problems. We tested different missing data scenarios on simulated independent cascades over LFR networks and real datasets, including Twitter and Memtracker. Experiments on these synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method successfully detects invisible social behaviors, predicts links, and identifies latent features."

However, the existing studies have not focused on the important value embedded in judgments reversals, which limits the improvement of the efficiency of legal intelligence. In this paper, we propose a causal Framework for Accurately Inferring case Reversals (FAIR), which models the problem of judgments reversals based on real Chinese judgments. We mine the causes of judgments reversals by causal inference methods and inject the obtained causal relationships into the neural network as a priori knowledge. And then, our framework is validated on a challenging dataset as a legal judgment prediction task. The experimental results show that our framework can tap the most critical factors in judgments reversal, and the obtained causal relationships can effectively improve the neural network's performance. In addition, we discuss the generalization ability of large language models for legal intelligence tasks using ChatGPT as an example. Our experiment has found that the generalization ability of large language models still has defects, and mining causal relationships can effectively improve the accuracy and explain ability of model predictions."

However, the discrete nature of natural language makes the disentangling of textual representations more challenging (e.g., the manipulation over the data space cannot be easily achieved). Inspired by information theory, we propose a novel method that effectively manifests disentangled representations of text, without any supervision on semantics. A new mutual information upper bound is derived and leveraged to measure dependence between style and content. By minimizing this upper bound, the proposed method induces style and content embeddings into two independent low-dimensional spaces. Experiments on both conditional text generation and text-style transfer demonstrate the high quality of our disentangled representation in terms of content and style preservation."
546,aaai,2021,Stabilizing Q Learning Via Soft Mellowmax Operator,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16919,"Learning complicated value functions in high dimensional state space by function approximation is a challenging task, partially due to that the max-operator used in temporal difference updates can theoretically cause instability for most linear or non-linear approximation schemes. Mellowmax is a recently proposed differentiable and non-expansion softmax operator that allows a convergent behavior in learning and planning. Unfortunately, the performance bound for the fixed point it converges to remains unclear, and in practice, its parameter is sensitive to various domains and has to be tuned case by case. Finally, the Mellowmax operator may suffer from oversmoothing as it ignores the probability being taken for each action when aggregating them. In this paper, we address all the above issues with an enhanced Mellowmax operator, named SM2 (Soft Mellowmax). Particularly, the proposed operator is reliable, easy to implement, and has provable performance guarantee, while preserving all the advantages of Mellowmax. Furthermore, we show that our SM2 operator can be applied to the challenging multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios, leading to stable value function approximation and state of the art performance."
547,aaai,2021,Optimising Automatic Calibration of Electric Muscle Stimulation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16493,"Human movement disorders or paralysis lead to the loss of control of muscle activation and thus motor control. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is an established and safe technique for contracting muscles by stimulating the skin above a muscle to induce its contraction. However, an open challenge remains on how to restore motor abilities to human limbs through FES, as the problem of controlling the stimulation is unclear. We are taking a robotics perspective on this problem, by developing robot learning algorithms that control the ultimate humanoid robot, the human body, through electrical muscle stimulation. Human muscles are not trivial to control as actuators due to their force production being non-stationary as a result of fatigue and other internal state changes, in contrast to robot actuators which are well-understood and stationary over broad operation ranges. We present our Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to the control of human muscles with FES, using a recurrent neural network for dynamic state representation, to overcome the unobserved elements of the behaviour of human muscles under external stimulation. We demonstrate our technique both in neuromuscular simulations but also experimentally on a human. Our results show that our controller can learn to manipulate human muscles, applying appropriate levels of stimulation to achieve the given tasks while compensating for advancing muscle fatigue which arises throughout the tasks. Additionally, our technique can learn quickly enough to be implemented in real-world human-in-the-loop settings."
548,aaai,2021,A Systematic Evaluation of Object Detection Networks for Scientific Plots,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16227,"Are existing object detection methods adequate for detecting text and visual elements in scientific plots which are arguably different than the objects found in natural images? To answer this question, we train and compare the accuracy of various SOTA object detection networks on the PlotQA dataset. At the standard IOU setting of 0.5, most networks perform well with mAP scores greater than 80% in detecting the relatively simple objects in plots. However, the performance drops drastically when evaluated at a stricter IOU of 0.9 with the best model giving a mAP of 35.70%. Note that such a stricter evaluation is essential when dealing with scientific plots where even minor localisation errors can lead to large errors in downstream numerical inferences. Given this poor performance, we propose minor modifications to existing models by combining ideas from different object detection networks. While this significantly improves the performance, there are still 2 main issues: (i) performance on text objects which are essential for reasoning is very poor, and (ii) inference time is unacceptably large considering the simplicity of plots. To solve this open problem, we make a series of contributions: (a) an efficient region proposal method based on Laplacian edge detectors, (b) a feature representation of region proposals that includes neighbouring information, (c) a linking component to join multiple region proposals for detecting longer textual objects, and (d) a custom loss function that combines a smooth L1-loss with an IOU-based loss. Combining these ideas, our final model is very accurate at extreme IOU values achieving a mAP of 93.44%@0.9 IOU. Simultaneously, our model is very efficient with an inference time 16x lesser than the current models, including one-stage detectors. With these contributions, we enable further exploration on the automated reasoning of plots."

We propose to cast the problem of multiple object tracking as learning the frame-wise associations between detections in consecutive frames. To this end, we propose differentiable soft object assignment for object association, making it possible to learn features tailored to object association with differentiable end-to-end training. With this training approach in hand, we develop an appearance-based model for learning instance-aware object features used to construct a cost matrix based on the pairwise distances between the object features. We train our model using temporal and multi-view data, where we obtain association pseudo-labels using optical flow and disparity information. Unlike most self-supervised tracking methods that rely on pretext tasks for learning the feature correspondences, our method is directly optimized for cross-object association in complex scenarios. As such, the proposed method offers a reidentification-based MOT approach that is robust to training hyperparameters and does not suffer from local minima, which are a challenge in self-supervised methods. We evaluate our proposed model on the KITTI, Waymo, nuScenes, and Argoverse datasets, consistently improving over other unsupervised methods ($7.8\%$ improvement in association accuracy on nuScenes)."

Manually optimizing tensor operators has limitations in terms of supporting new operators or hardware platforms. Therefore, automatically optimizing device code configurations of tensor operators is getting increasingly attractive. However, current methods for tensor operator optimization usually suffer from poor sample-efficiency due to the combinatorial search space. In this work, we propose a novel evolutionary method, OpEvo, which efficiently explores the search spaces of tensor operators by introducing a topology-aware mutation operation based on q-random walk to leverage the topological structures over the search spaces. Our comprehensive experiment results show that compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods OpEvo can find the best configuration with the lowest variance and least efforts in the number of trials and wall-clock time.

Under the general convex-concave assumption, most first-order methods only guarantee an ergodic convergence rate, that is, the uniform averages of the iterates converge at a $O(1/T)$ rate in terms of the saddle-point residual. However, numerically, the iterates themselves can often converge much faster than the uniform averages. This observation motivates increasing averaging schemes that put more weight on later iterates, in contrast to the usual uniform averaging. We show that such increasing averaging schemes, applied to various first-order methods, are able to preserve the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate with no additional assumptions or computational overhead. Extensive numerical experiments on zero-sum game solving, market equilibrium computation and image denoising demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. In particular, the increasing averages consistently outperform the uniform averages in all test problems by orders of magnitude. When solving matrix and extensive-form games, increasing averages consistently outperform the last iterates as well. For matrix games, a first-order method equipped with increasing averaging outperforms the highly competitive CFR$^+$ algorithm."

For quadratic models the algorithm is also an instance of averaged stochastic gradient, where the parameter is a moving average of a ""fast"", constant-rate gradient descent. TANGO appears as a particular de-linearization of averaged SGD, and is sometimes quite different on non-quadratic models. This further connects averaged SGD and natural gradient, both of which are arguably optimal asymptotically.   In large dimension, small learning rates will be required to approximate the natural gradient well. Still, this shows it is possible to get arbitrarily close to exact natural gradient descent with a lightweight algorithm."

Recent works introduce the label knowledge to enhance the text representation by formalizing the span extraction task into a question answering problem (QA Formalization), which achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, QA Formalization does not fully exploit the label knowledge and suffers from low efficiency in training/inference. To address those problems, we introduce a new paradigm to integrate label knowledge and further propose a novel model to explicitly and efficiently integrate label knowledge into text representations. Specifically, it encodes texts and label annotations independently and then integrates label knowledge into text representation with an elaborate-designed semantics fusion module. We conduct extensive experiments on three typical span extraction tasks: flat NER, nested NER, and event detection. The empirical results show that 1) our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, and 2) reduces training time and inference time by 76% and 77% on average, respectively, compared with the QA Formalization paradigm.

Representation learning for 3D meshes is important in many computer vision and graphics applications. The recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for structured data (e.g., images) suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN for 3D shapes. However, 3D shape data are irregular since each node's neighbors are unordered. Various graph neural networks for 3D shapes have been developed with isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems to overcome the node inconsistency on graphs. However, isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems limit the representation power. In this paper, we propose a local structure-aware anisotropic convolutional operation (LSA-Conv) that learns adaptive weighting matrices for each node according to the local neighboring structure and performs shared anisotropic filters. In fact, the learnable weighting matrix is similar to the attention matrix in the random synthesizer -- a new Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model produces significant improvement in 3D shape reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods."
557,aaai,2021,Addressing Domain Gap via Content Invariant Representation for Semantic Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16922,"In this paper, we tackle the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation, which aims to segment the unlabeled real data using labeled synthetic data. The main problem of UDA for semantic segmentation relies on reducing the domain gap between the real image and synthetic image. To solve this problem, we focused on separating information in an image into content and style. Here, only the content has cues for semantic segmentation, and the style makes the domain gap. Thus, precise separation of content and style in an image leads to effect as supervision of real data even when learning with synthetic data. To make the best of this effect, we propose a zero-style loss. Even though we perfectly extract content for semantic segmentation in the real domain, another main challenge, the class imbalance problem, still exists in UDA for semantic segmentation. We address this problem by transferring the contents of tail classes from synthetic to real domain. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation on the major two UDA settings."

These training settings expose the encoder and the decoder in a machine translation model with different data distributions. In this paper, we examine how different varieties of multilingual training contribute to learning these two components of the MT model. Specifically, we compare bilingual models with encoders and/or decoders initialized by multilingual training. We show that multilingual training is beneficial to encoders in general, while it only benefits decoders for low-resource languages (LRLs). We further find the important attention heads for each language pair and compare their correlations during inference. Our analysis sheds light on how multilingual translation models work and enables us to propose methods to improve performance by training with highly related languages. Our many-to-one models for high-resource languages and one-to-many models for LRL outperform the best results reported by Aharoni et al. (2019)"

We fix a mean, $\mu$, in the interval $[0, 1]$ and let each player choose any random variable distributed on that interval with the given mean. The winner of the zero-sum game is the player whose random variable has the highest realization. We show that the position of the mean within the interval is paramount. Remarkably, if the given mean is above a crucial threshold then the unique equilibrium must contain a point mass on $1$. The cutoff is strictly decreasing in the number of players, $n$; and for fixed $\mu$, as the number of players is increased, each player places more weight on $1$ at equilibrium. We characterize the equilibrium as the number of players goes to infinity."

In this paper, we propose to equip the backbone network with an attention agent, which is trained by reinforcement learning. The policy gradient algorithm is employed to train the agent towards adaptively localizing the representative regions on feature maps over time. We further design a reward function based on the prediction of the held-out data, thus helping the attention mechanism to generalize better across the unseen classes. The extensive experiments show, with the help of the reinforced attention, that our embedding network has the capability to progressively generate a more discriminative representation in few-shot learning. Moreover, experiments on the task of image classification also show the effectiveness of the proposed design."
562,aaai,2021,Fair and Interpretable Algorithmic Hiring using Evolutionary Many Objective Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17737,"Society has come to rely on algorithms like classifiers for important decision making, giving rise to the need for ethical guarantees such as fairness. Fairness is typically defined by asking that some statistic of a classifier be approximately equal over protected groups within a population. In this paper, current approaches to fairness are discussed and used to motivate algorithmic proposals that incorporate fairness into genetic programming for classification. We propose two ideas. The first is to incorporate a fairness objective into multi-objective optimization. The second is to adapt lexicase selection to define cases dynamically over intersections of protected groups. We describe why lexicase selection is well suited to pressure models to perform well across the potentially infinitely many subgroups over which fairness is desired. We use a recent genetic programming approach to construct models on four datasets for which fairness constraints are necessary, and empirically compare performance to prior methods utilizing game-theoretic solutions. Methods are assessed based on their ability to generate trade-offs of subgroup fairness and accuracy that are Pareto optimal. The result show that genetic programming methods in general, and random search in particular, are well suited to this task."

The problem concerns industrial test laboratories in which a large number of tests has to be performed by qualified personnel using specialised equipment, while respecting deadlines and other constraints. We present different constraint programming models and search strategies for this problem. Furthermore, we propose a Very Large Neighborhood Search approach based on our CP methods. Our models are evaluated using CP solvers and a MIP solver both on real-world test laboratory data and on a set of generated instances of different sizes based on the real-world data. Further, we compare the exact approaches with VLNS and a Simulated Annealing heuristic. We could find feasible solutions for all instances and several optimal solutions and we show that using VLNS we can improve upon the results of the other approaches."

It uses a net that reveals preferences from the agents' past joint trajectory, and a differentiable implicit layer that maps these preferences to local Nash equilibria, forming the modes of the predicted future trajectory. Additionally, it learns an equilibrium refinement concept. For tractability, we introduce a new class of continuous potential games and an equilibrium-separating partition of the action space. We provide theoretical results for explicit gradients and soundness. In experiments, we evaluate our approach on two real-world data sets, where we predict highway driver merging trajectories, and on a simple decision-making transfer task."

This task thus poses a challenging multi-modal representation learning and reasoning scenario, advancements into which could influence several human-machine interaction applications. To solve this task, we introduce a semantics-controlled multi-modal shuffled Transformer reasoning framework, consisting of a sequence of Transformer modules, each taking a modality as input and producing representations conditioned on the input question. Our proposed Transformer variant uses a shuffling scheme on their multi-head outputs, demonstrating better regularization. To encode fine-grained visual information, we present a novel dynamic scene graph representation learning pipeline that consists of an intra-frame reasoning layer producing spatio-semantic graph representations for every frame, and an inter-frame aggregation module capturing temporal cues. Our entire pipeline is trained end-to-end. We present experiments on the benchmark AVSD dataset, both on answer generation and selection tasks. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performances on all evaluation metrics."

Learning better representations is critical to improve the performance of downstream tasks. Due to the advances in machine learning, we now can learn better and meaningful representations from EHR through disentangling the underlying factors inside data and distilling large amounts of information and knowledge from heterogeneous EHR sources. In this chapter, we first introduce the background of learning representations and reasons why we need good EHR representations in machine learning for medicine and healthcare in Section 1. Next, we explain the commonly-used machine learning and evaluation methods for representation learning using a deep learning approach in Section 2. Following that, we review recent related studies of learning patient state representation from EHR for clinical machine learning tasks in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 we discuss more techniques, studies, and challenges for learning natural language representations when free texts, such as clinical notes, examination reports, or biomedical literature are used. We also discuss challenges and opportunities in these rapidly growing research fields."

Unlike many other EaaS tools that focus primarily on fixed sample A/B testing, Comparison Lift deploys a custom bandit-based experimentation algorithm. The advantages of the bandit-based approach are two-fold. First, it aligns the randomization induced in the test with the advertiser's goals from testing. Second, by adapting experimental design to information acquired during the test, it reduces substantially the cost of experimentation to the advertiser. Since launch in May 2019, Comparison Lift has been utilized in over 1,500 experiments. We estimate that utilization of the product has helped increase click-through rates of participating advertising campaigns by 46% on average. We estimate that the adaptive design in the product has generated 27% more clicks on average during testing compared to a fixed sample A/B design. Both suggest significant value generation and cost savings to advertisers from the product."
568,aaai,2021,Creating Interpretable Data-Driven Approaches for Remote Health Monitoring,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17853,"Sensor-based remote health monitoring is used in industrial, urban and healthcare settings to monitor ongoing operation of equipment and human health. An important aim is to intervene early if anomalous events or adverse health is detected. In the wild, these anomaly detection approaches are challenged by noise, label scarcity, high dimensionality, explainability and wide variability in operating environments. The Contextual Matrix Profile (CMP) is a configurable 2-dimensional version of the Matrix Profile (MP) that uses the distance matrix of all subsequences of a time series to discover patterns and anomalies. The CMP is shown to enhance the effectiveness of the MP and other SOTA methods at detecting, visualising and interpreting true anomalies in noisy real world data from different domains. It excels at zooming out and identifying temporal patterns at configurable time scales. However, the CMP does not address cross-sensor information, and cannot scale to high dimensional data. We propose a novel, self-supervised graph-based approach for temporal anomaly detection that works on context graphs generated from the CMP distance matrix. The learned graph embeddings encode the anomalous nature of a time context. In addition, we evaluate other graph outlier algorithms for the same task. Given our pipeline is modular, graph construction, generation of graph embeddings, and pattern recognition logic can all be chosen based on the specific pattern detection application. We verified the effectiveness of graph-based anomaly detection and compared it with the CMP and 3 state-of-the art methods on two real-world healthcare datasets with different anomalies. Our proposed method demonstrated better recall, alert rate and generalisability."

This study aims to determine whether indoor smoking bans at workplaces can effectively reduce the smoking rate. The Smokeban dataset used for this study is an observational dataset that contains some socio-demographic factors, whether people smoke, and whether smoking bans exist. Since the observational data used in the study did not randomize people into with-smoking-bans group and without-smoking-bans group, confounders may cause bias in the estimation of whether the smoking bans can reduce smoking rates. The propensity score matching(PSM) method can reduce these biases via using a logistic regression model to predict the similarities of people in those 2 groups and using the nearest neighbour matching technique to match people who are the most similar. After reducing the bias, another regression model was created to interpret the relationship between the probability of smoking and the indoor smoking bans. We conclude by arguing that with the existence of indoor smoking bans, the probability of people who smoke can be decreased greatly."

Given the multitude of propositions, it has become imperative to formally verify the fairness metrics satisfied by different algorithms on different datasets. In this paper, we propose a stochastic satisfiability (SSAT) framework, Justicia, that formally verifies different fairness measures of supervised learning algorithms with respect to the underlying data distribution. We instantiate Justicia on multiple classification and bias mitigation algorithms, and datasets to verify different fairness metrics, such as disparate impact, statistical parity, and equalized odds. Justicia is scalable, accurate, and operates on non-Boolean and compound sensitive attributes unlike existing distribution-based verifiers, such as FairSquare and VeriFair. Being distribution-based by design, Justicia is more robust than the verifiers, such as AIF360, that operate on specific test samples. We also theoretically bound the finite-sample error of the verified fairness measure."

These changes can force workers to transition to new jobs. This may be because new technologies emerge or production is moved abroad. Perhaps it is a global crisis, such as COVID-19, which shutters industries and displaces labor en masse. Regardless of the impetus, people are faced with the challenge of moving between jobs to find new work. Successful transitions typically occur when workers leverage their existing skills in the new occupation. Here, we propose a novel method to measure the similarity between occupations using their underlying skills. We then build a recommender system for identifying optimal transition pathways between occupations using job advertisements (ads) data and a longitudinal household survey. Our results show that not only can we accurately predict occupational transitions (Accuracy = 76%), but we account for the asymmetric difficulties of moving between jobs (it is easier to move in one direction than the other). We also build an early warning indicator for new technology adoption (showcasing Artificial Intelligence), a major driver of rising job transitions. By using real-time data, our systems can respond to labor demand shifts as they occur (such as those caused by COVID-19). They can be leveraged by policy-makers, educators, and job seekers who are forced to confront the often distressing challenges of finding new jobs."

For querying the absence of information, however, there exist only few ontology-based approaches. Moreover, these proposals conflate the closed-domain and closed-world assumption, and therefore are not suited to deal with the anonymous objects that are common in ontological reasoning. Many real-world applications, like processing electronic health records (EHRs), also contain a temporal dimension, and require efficient reasoning algorithms. Moreover, since medical data is not recorded on a regular basis, reasoners must deal with sparse data with potentially large temporal gaps. Our contribution consists of two main parts: In the first part we introduce a new closed-world semantics for answering conjunctive queries with negation over ontologies formulated in the description logic ELHb, which is based on the minimal canonical model. We propose a rewriting strategy for dealing with negated query atoms, which shows that query answering is possible in polynomial time in data complexity. In the second part, we extend this minimal-world semantics for answering metric temporal conjunctive queries with negation over the lightweight temporal logic TELHb and obtain similar rewritability and complexity results. This paper is under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)."

We propose a novel unsupervised approach to transform data into a compressed binary representation independent of sensitive attributes.

Empirical results show that the proposed method, \textbf{FBC}, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-fairness trade-off. Explicit control of the entropy of the representation bit stream allows the user to move smoothly and simultaneously along both rate-distortion and rate-fairness curves. \end{abstract}"

Our goal is to distribute these resources to maximize fairness and efficiency. Achieving any non-trivial guarantees in an adversarial setting is impossible. However, we show that normalizing the agent values, a very common assumption in fair division, allows us to escape this impossibility. Our main result is an online algorithm for the case of two agents that ensures the outcome is envy-free while guaranteeing 91.6% of the optimal social welfare. We also show that this is near-optimal: there is no envy-free algorithm that guarantees more than 93.3% of the optimal social welfare."

Inspired by recent advances in quantum cognition, we show that the sentiment judgment from one modality could be incompatible with the judgment from another, i.e., the order matters and they cannot be jointly measured to produce a final decision. Thus the cognitive process exhibits ""quantum-like"" biases that cannot be captured by classical probability theories. Accordingly, we propose a fundamentally new, quantum cognitively motivated fusion strategy for predicting sentiment judgments. In particular, we formulate utterances as quantum superposition states of positive and negative sentiment judgments, and uni-modal classifiers as mutually incompatible observables, on a complex-valued Hilbert space with positive-operator valued measures. Experiments on two benchmarking datasets illustrate that our model significantly outperforms various existing decision level and a range of state-of-the-art content-level fusion approaches. The results also show that the concept of incompatibility allows effective handling of all combination patterns, including those extreme cases that are wrongly predicted by all uni-modal classifiers."

NAS performs exhaustive candidate architecture search, incurring tremendous search cost. Though (structured) pruning can simply shrink model dimension, it remains unclear how to decide the per-layer sparsity automatically and optimally. In this work, we revisit the problem of layer-width optimization and propose Pruning-as-Search (PaS), an end-to-end channel pruning method to search out desired sub-network automatically and efficiently. Specifically, we add a depth-wise binary convolution to learn pruning policies directly through gradient descent. By combining the structural reparameterization and PaS, we successfully searched out a new family of VGG-like and lightweight networks, which enable the flexibility of arbitrary width with respect to each layer instead of each stage. Experimental results show that our proposed architecture outperforms prior arts by around $1.0\%$ top-1 accuracy under similar inference speed on ImageNet-1000 classification task. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our width search on complex tasks including instance segmentation and image translation. Code and models are released."

For Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers proof logging has been introduced as a way to certify correctness, but the methods used seem hard to generalize to stronger paradigms. What is more, even for enhanced SAT techniques such as parity (XOR) reasoning, cardinality detection, and symmetry handling, it has remained beyond reach to design practically efficient proofs in the standard DRAT format. In this work, we show how to instead use pseudo-Boolean inequalities with extension variables to concisely justify XOR reasoning. Our experimental evaluation of a SAT solver integration shows a dramatic decrease in proof logging and verification time compared to existing DRAT methods. Since our method is a strict generalization of DRAT, and readily lends itself to expressing also 0-1 programming and even constraint programming problems, we hope this work points the way towards a unified approach for efficient machine-verifiable proofs for a rich class of combinatorial optimization paradigms."

In this model, called the voting committee model, the elected group of representatives runs a number of ballots to make final decisions regarding various issues. The satisfaction of voters comes from the final decisions made by the elected committee. Our results suggest that depending on a decision system used by the committee to make these final decisions, different multi-winner election rules are most suitable for electing the committee. Furthermore, we show that if we allow not only a committee, but also an election rule used to make final decisions, to depend on the voters' preferences, we can obtain an even better representation of the voters."
579,aaai,2021,The Importance of Modeling Data Missingness in Algorithmic Fairness: A Causal Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16926,"Training datasets for machine learning often have some form of missingness. For example, to learn a model for deciding whom to give a loan, the available training data includes individuals who were given a loan in the past, but not those who were not. This missingness, if ignored, nullifies any fairness guarantee of the training procedure when the model is deployed. Using causal graphs, we characterize the missingness mechanisms in different real-world scenarios. We show conditions under which various distributions, used in popular fairness algorithms, can or can not be recovered from the training data. Our theoretical results imply that many of these algorithms can not guarantee fairness in practice. Modeling missingness also helps to identify correct design principles for fair algorithms. For example, in multi-stage settings where decisions are made in multiple screening rounds, we use our framework to derive the minimal distributions required to design a fair algorithm. Our proposed algorithm decentralizes the decision-making process and still achieves similar performance to the optimal algorithm that requires centralization and non-recoverable distributions."

The most compelling defence to date is adversarial training and consists of complementing the training data set with adversarial examples. Yet adversarial training severely impacts training time and depends on finding representative adversarial samples. In this paper we propose to train models on output spaces with large class separation in order to gain robustness without adversarial training. We introduce a method to partition the output space into class prototypes with large separation and train models to preserve it. Experimental results shows that models trained with these prototypes -- which we call deep repulsive prototypes -- gain robustness competitive with adversarial training, while also preserving more accuracy on natural samples. Moreover, the models are more resilient to large perturbation sizes. For example, we obtained over 50% robustness for CIFAR-10, with 92% accuracy on natural samples and over 20% robustness for CIFAR-100, with 71% accuracy on natural samples without adversarial training. For both data sets, the models preserved robustness against large perturbations better than adversarially trained models."

We study the problem of heart signal electrocardiogram (ECG) synthesis for improved heartbeat classification. ECG synthesis is challenging: the generation of training examples for such biological-physiological systems is not straightforward, due to their dynamic nature in which the various parts of the system interact in complex ways. However, an understanding of these dynamics has been developed for years in the form of mathematical process simulators. We study how to incorporate this knowledge into the generative process by leveraging a biological simulator for the task of ECG classification. Specifically, we use a system of ordinary differential equations representing heart dynamics, and incorporate this ODE system into the optimization process of a generative adversarial network to create biologically plausible ECG training examples. We perform empirical evaluation and show that heart simulation knowledge during the generation process improves ECG classification."

However MELD score accuracy to predict long term mortality has not been statistically evaluated. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze the MELD score as well as other variables as a predictor of long-term mortality using a new model: the Survival Tree analysis. Study Design and Setting: The variables obtained at the time of liver transplantation list enrollment and considered in this study are: sex, age, blood type, body mass index, etiology of liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, waiting time for transplant and MELD. Mortality on the waiting list is the outcome. Exclusion, transplantation or still in the transplantation list at the end of the study are censored data. Results: The graphical representation of the survival trees showed that the most statistically significant cut off is related to MELD score at point 16. Conclusion: The results are compatible with the cut off point of MELD indicated in the clinical literature."

In high temperature and high pressure in-cylinder conditions, the fuel-air mixture auto-ignites creating pressure shock waves in the cylinder. Knock can significantly damage the engine and hinder its performance; as such, conservative knock control strategies are generally implemented that avoid such operating conditions at the cost of lower thermal efficiencies. Significant improvements in the performance of conventional knock controllers are possible if the properties of the knock process are better characterized and exploited in knock controller designs. One of the methods undertaken to better characterize knocking instances is to employ a probabilistic approach, in which the likelihood of knock is derived from the statistical distribution of knock intensity. In this paper, it is shown that knock intensity values at a fixed operating point for single fuel and dual fuel engines are accurately described using a mixed lognormal distribution. The fitting accuracy is compared against those for a randomly generated mixed-lognormally distributed data set, and shown to exceed a 95% accuracy threshold for almost all of the operating points tested. Additionally, this paper discusses a stochastic knock control approach that leverages the mixed lognormal distribution to adjust spark timing based on knock intensity measurements. This more informed knock control strategy would allow for improvements in engine performance and fuel efficiency by minimizing knock occurrences."

Therefore, it is a natural choice to aggregate temporal information from other frames of the same video into the current frame. However, RoI Align, as one of the most core procedures of video detectors, still remains extracting features from a single-frame feature map for proposals, making the extracted RoI features lack temporal information from videos. In this work, considering the features of the same object instance are highly similar among frames in a video, a novel Temporal RoI Align operator is proposed to extract features from other frames feature maps for current frame proposals by utilizing feature similarity. The proposed Temporal RoI Align operator can extract temporal information from the entire video for proposals. We integrate it into single-frame video detectors and other state-of-the-art video detectors, and conduct quantitative experiments to demonstrate that the proposed Temporal RoI Align operator can consistently and significantly boost the performance. Besides, the proposed Temporal RoI Align can also be applied into video instance segmentation. Codes are available at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmtracking"

While exceptionally successful, current methods assume the availability of training images in both source and target domains, which does not always hold in practice. Inspired by humans' reasoning capability of analogy, we propose analogical image translation (AIT). Given images of two styles in the source domain: $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}^\prime$, along with images $\mathcal{B}$ of the first style in the target domain, learn a model to translate $\mathcal{B}$ to $\mathcal{B}^\prime$ in the target domain, such that $\mathcal{A}:\mathcal{A}^\prime ::\mathcal{B}:\mathcal{B}^\prime$. AIT is especially useful for translation scenarios in which training data of one style is hard to obtain but training data of the same two styles in another domain is available. For instance, in the case from normal conditions to extreme, rare conditions, obtaining real training images for the latter case is challenging but obtaining synthetic data for both cases is relatively easy. In this work, we are interested in adding adverse weather effects, more specifically fog effects, to images taken in clear weather. To circumvent the challenge of collecting real foggy images, AIT learns with synthetic clear-weather images, synthetic foggy images and real clear-weather images to add fog effects onto real clear-weather images without seeing any real foggy images during training. AIT achieves this zero-shot image translation capability by coupling a supervised training scheme in the synthetic domain, a cycle consistency strategy in the real domain, an adversarial training scheme between the two domains, and a novel network design. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method for zero-short image translation and its benefit for downstream tasks such as semantic foggy scene understanding."

Existing abusive language detection techniques are particularly ill-suited to comments containing heterogeneous abusive language patterns, i.e., both abusive and non-abusive parts. This is due in part to the lack of datasets that explicitly annotate heterogeneity in abusive language. We tackle this challenge by providing an annotated dataset of abusive language in over 11,000 comments from YouTube. We account for heterogeneity in this dataset by separately annotating both the comment as a whole and the individual sentences that comprise each comment. We then propose an algorithm that uses a supervised attention mechanism to detect and categorize abusive content using multi-task learning. We empirically demonstrate the challenges of using traditional techniques on heterogeneous content and the comparative gains in performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods."

Finding structural and semantic differences between two different three-dimensional point clouds, say, of the same region but acquired at different time instances is an important problem. A comparison of point clouds involves computationally expensive registration and segmentation. We are interested in capturing the relative differences in the geometric uncertainty and semantic content of the point cloud without the registration process. Hence, we propose an orientation-invariant geometric signature of the point cloud, which integrates its probabilistic geometric and semantic classifications. We study different properties of the geometric signature, which are an image-based encoding of geometric uncertainty and semantic content. We explore different metrics to determine differences between these signatures, which in turn compare point clouds without performing point-to-point registration. Our results show that the differences in the signatures corroborate with the geometric and semantic differences of the point clouds."

In that work, policies are stochastic and are defined on finite action spaces. We extend those results to offer a provably-convergent decentralized actor-critic algorithm for learning deterministic policies on continuous action spaces. Deterministic policies are important in real-world settings. To handle the lack of exploration inherent in deterministic policies, we consider both off-policy and on-policy settings. We provide the expression of a local deterministic policy gradient, decentralized deterministic actor-critic algorithms and convergence guarantees for linearly-approximated value functions. This work will help enable decentralized MARL in high-dimensional action spaces and pave the way for more widespread use of MARL."
590,aaai,2021,SMART Frame Selection for Action Recognition,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16235,"Action recognition is computationally expensive. In this paper, we address the problem of frame selection to improve the accuracy of action recognition. In particular, we show that selecting good frames helps in action recognition performance even in the trimmed videos domain. Recent work has successfully leveraged frame selection for long, untrimmed videos, where much of the content is not relevant, and easy to discard. In this work, however, we focus on the more standard short, trimmed action recognition problem. We argue that good frame selection can not only reduce the computational cost of action recognition but also increase the accuracy by getting rid of frames that are hard to classify. In contrast to previous work, we propose a method that instead of selecting frames by considering one at a time, considers them jointly. This results in a more efficient selection, where good frames are more effectively distributed over the video, like snapshots that tell a story. We call the proposed frame selection SMART and we test it in combination with different backbone architectures and on multiple benchmarks (Kinetics, Something-something, UCF101). We show that the SMART frame selection consistently improves the accuracy compared to other frame selection strategies while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 4 to 10 times. Additionally, we show that when the primary goal is recognition performance, our selection strategy can improve over recent state-of-the-art models and frame selection strategies on various benchmarks (UCF101, HMDB51, FCVID, and ActivityNet)."
591,aaai,2021,Neural Latent Space Model for Dynamic Networks and Temporal Knowledge Graphs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16526,"Although static networks have been extensively studied in machine learning, data mining, and AI communities for many decades, the study of dynamic networks has recently taken center stage due to the prominence of social media and its effects on the dynamics of social networks. In this paper, we propose a statistical model for dynamically evolving networks, together with a variational inference approach. Our model, Neural Latent Space Model with Variational Inference, encodes edge dependencies across different time snapshots. It represents nodes via latent vectors and uses interaction matrices to model the presence of edges. These matrices can be used to incorporate multiple relations in heterogeneous networks by having a separate matrix for each of the relations. To capture the temporal dynamics, both node vectors and interaction matrices are allowed to evolve with time. Existing network analysis methods use representation learning techniques for modelling networks. These techniques are different for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks because heterogeneous networks can have multiple types of edges and nodes as opposed to a homogeneous network. Unlike these, we propose a unified model for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks in a variational inference framework. Moreover, the learned node latent vectors and interaction matrices may be interpretable and therefore provide insights on the mechanisms behind network evolution. We experimented with a single step and multi-step link forecasting on real-world networks of homogeneous, bipartite, and heterogeneous nature, and demonstrated that our model significantly outperforms existing models."

To solve them, one typically resorts to robust optimization methods. However, this significantly increases computational complexity and limits scalability in both learning and planning. On the other hand, regularized MDPs show more stability in policy learning without impairing time complexity. Yet, they generally do not encompass uncertainty in the model dynamics. In this work, we aim to learn robust MDPs using regularization. We first show that regularized MDPs are a particular instance of robust MDPs with uncertain reward. We thus establish that policy iteration on reward-robust MDPs can have the same time complexity as on regularized MDPs. We further extend this relationship to MDPs with uncertain transitions: this leads to a regularization term with an additional dependence on the value function. We finally generalize regularized MDPs to twice regularized MDPs (R${}^2$ MDPs), i.e., MDPs with $\textit{both}$ value and policy regularization. The corresponding Bellman operators enable developing policy iteration schemes with convergence and robustness guarantees. It also reduces planning and learning in robust MDPs to regularized MDPs."

It gives EU residents the ability to request deletion of their personal data, including training records used to train machine learning models. Unfortunately, Deep Neural Network models are vulnerable to information leaking attacks such as model inversion attacks which extract class information from a trained model and membership inference attacks which determine the presence of an example in a model's training data. If a malicious party can mount an attack and learn private information that was meant to be removed, then it implies that the model owner has not properly protected their user's rights and their models may not be compliant with the GDPR law. In this paper, we present two efficient methods that address this question of how a model owner or data holder may delete personal data from models in such a way that they may not be vulnerable to model inversion and membership inference attacks while maintaining model efficacy. We start by presenting a real-world threat model that shows that simply removing training data is insufficient to protect users. We follow that up with two data removal methods, namely Unlearning and Amnesiac Unlearning, that enable model owners to protect themselves against such attacks while being compliant with regulations. We provide extensive empirical analysis that show that these methods are indeed efficient, safe to apply, effectively remove learned information about sensitive data from trained models while maintaining model efficacy."

They also raise ethical concerns about the generation of fake media, data protection, privacy and ownership of AI-generated art. Since generative AI is already being used in products used by youth, it is critical that they understand how these tools work and how they can be used or misused. In this work, we facilitated students' generative AI learning through expression of their imagined future identities. We designed a learning workshop - Dreaming with AI - where students learned about the inner workings of generative AI tools, used text-to-image generation algorithms to create their imaged future dreams, reflected on the potential benefits and harms of generative AI tools and voiced their opinions about policies for the use of these tools in classrooms. In this paper, we present the learning activities and experiences of 34 high school students who engaged in our workshops. Students reached creative learning objectives by using prompt engineering to create their future dreams, gained technical knowledge by learning the abilities, limitations, text-visual mappings and applications of generative AI, and identified most potential societal benefits and harms of generative AI."

Our goal is to pinpoint correct and incorrect concepts in student answers in order to achieve better student learning gains. Although automatic methods for providing personalized feedback exist, they do not explicitly inform students about which concepts in their answers are correct or incorrect. Our approach involves decomposing students answers using neural discourse segmentation and classification techniques. This decomposition yields a relational graph over all discourse units covered by the reference solutions and student answers. We use this inferred relational graph structure and a neural classifier to match student answers with reference solutions and generate personalized feedback. Although the process is completely automated and data-driven, the personalized feedback generated is highly contextual, domain-aware and effectively targets each student's misconceptions and knowledge gaps. We test our method in a dialogue-based ITS and demonstrate that our approach results in high-quality feedback and significantly improved student learning gains."

For this purpose, we introduce Stochastic Lagrangian Reachability (SLR), an abstraction-based technique for constructing a tight Reachtube (an over-approximation of the set of reachable states over a given time-horizon), and provide stochastic guarantees in the form of confidence intervals for the Reachtube bounds. SLR inherently avoids the infamous wrapping effect (accumulation of over-approximation errors) by performing local optimization steps to expand safe regions instead of repeatedly forward-propagating them as is done by deterministic reachability methods. To enable fast local optimizations, we introduce a novel forward-mode adjoint sensitivity method to compute gradients without the need for backpropagation. Finally, we establish asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence rates for SLR."

Such variation in word usage is often called lexical semantic change (LSC). The goal of LSC is to characterize and quantify language variations with respect to word meaning, to measure how distinct two language sources are (that is, people or language models). Because there is hardly any data available for such a task, most solutions involve unsupervised methods to align two embeddings and predict semantic change with respect to a distance measure. To that end, we propose a self-supervised approach to model lexical semantic change by generating training samples by introducing perturbations of word vectors in the input corpora. We show that our method can be used for the detection of semantic change with any alignment method. Furthermore, it can be used to choose the landmark words to use in alignment and can lead to substantial improvements over the existing techniques for alignment.   We illustrate the utility of our techniques using experimental results on three different datasets, involving words with the same or different meanings. Our methods not only provide significant improvements but also can lead to novel findings for the LSC problem."

Even very restricted special cases of BNSL are computationally hard, and, thus, in practice heuristics such as local search are used. A natural approach for a local search algorithm is a hill climbing strategy, where one replaces a given BNSL solution by a better solution within some pre-defined neighborhood as long as this is possible. We study ordering-based local search, where a solution is described via a topological ordering of the variables. We show that given such a topological ordering, one can compute an optimal DAG whose ordering is within inversion distance $r$ in subexponential FPT time; the parameter $r$ allows to balance between solution quality and running time of the local search algorithm. This running time bound can be achieved for BNSL without structural constraints and for all structural constraints that can be expressed via a sum of weights that are associated with each parent set. We also introduce a related distance called `window inversions distance' and show that the corresponding local search problem can also be solved in subexponential FPT time for the parameter $r$. For two further natural modification operations on the variable orderings, we show that algorithms with an FPT time for $r$ are unlikely. We also outline the limits of ordering-based local search by showing that it cannot be used for common structural constraints on the moralized graph of the network."

The novelty of this research lies in the utilisation of the Kelly Index to first classify matches into categories where each one denotes the different levels of predictive difficulty. Classification models using a wide suite of algorithms were developed for each category of matches in order to determine the efficacy of the approach. In conjunction to this, a set of previously unexplored features were engineering including Elo-based variables.   The dataset originated from the Premier League match data covering the 2019-2021 seasons. The findings indicate that the process of decomposing the predictive problem into sub-tasks was effective and produced competitive results with prior works, while the ensemble-based methods were the most effective.   The paper also devised an investment strategy in order to evaluate its effectiveness by benchmarking against bookmaker odds. An approach was developed that minimises risk by combining the Kelly Index with the predefined confidence thresholds of the predictive models. The experiments found that the proposed strategy can return a profit when following a conservative approach that focuses primarily on easy-to-predict matches where the predictive models display a high confidence level."

Unlike CNNs, capsule networks are designed to explicitly model part-whole hierarchical relationships by using groups of neurons to encode visual entities, and learn the relationships between those entities. Promising early results achieved by capsule networks have motivated the deep learning community to continue trying to improve their performance and scalability across several application areas. However, a major hurdle for capsule network research has been the lack of a reliable point of reference for understanding their foundational ideas and motivations. The aim of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the capsule network research landscape, which will serve as a valuable resource for the community going forward. To that end, we start with an introduction to the fundamental concepts and motivations behind capsule networks, such as equivariant inference in computer vision. We then cover the technical advances in the capsule routing mechanisms and the various formulations of capsule networks, e.g. generative and geometric. Additionally, we provide a detailed explanation of how capsule networks relate to the popular attention mechanism in Transformers, and highlight non-trivial conceptual similarities between them in the context of representation learning. Afterwards, we explore the extensive applications of capsule networks in computer vision, video and motion, graph representation learning, natural language processing, medical imaging and many others. To conclude, we provide an in-depth discussion regarding the main hurdles in capsule network research, and highlight promising research directions for future work."

In recent years, probabilistic load forecasting (PLF) has gained increased attention for its ability to provide uncertainty information that helps to improve the reliability and economics of system operation performances. This paper proposes a two-stage probabilistic load forecasting framework by integrating point forecast as a key probabilistic forecasting feature into PLF. In the first stage, all related features are utilized to train a point forecast model and also obtain the feature importance. In the second stage the forecasting model is trained, taking into consideration point forecast features, as well as selected feature subsets. During the testing period of the forecast model, the final probabilistic load forecast results are leveraged to obtain both point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting. Numerical results obtained from ISO New England demand data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the hour-ahead load forecasting, which uses the gradient boosting regression for the point forecasting and quantile regression neural networks for the probabilistic forecasting."

Mask R-CNN is a classic method of instance segmentation, but we find that its predicted masks are unclear and inaccurate near contours. To cope with this problem, we draw on the idea of contour matching based on distance transformation image and propose a novel loss function, called contour loss. Contour loss is designed to specifically optimize the contour parts of the predicted masks, thus can assure more accurate instance segmentation. In order to make the proposed contour loss to be jointly trained under modern neural network frameworks, we design a differentiable k-step distance transformation image calculation module, which can approximately compute truncated distance transformation images of the predicted mask and corresponding ground-truth mask online. The proposed contour loss can be integrated into existing instance segmentation methods such as Mask R-CNN, and combined with their original loss functions without modification of the inference network structures, thus has strong versatility. Experimental results on COCO show that contour loss is effective, which can further improve instance segmentation performances."

Recently, the concept of adaptive sparse connectivity, has emerged to allow training sparse neural networks from scratch by optimizing the sparse structure during training. However, comparing different sparse topologies and determining how sparse topologies evolve during training, especially for the situation in which the sparse structure optimization is involved, remain as challenging open questions. This comparison becomes increasingly complex as the number of possible topological comparisons increases exponentially with the size of networks. In this work, we introduce an approach to understand and compare sparse neural network topologies from the perspective of graph theory. We first propose Neural Network Sparse Topology Distance (NNSTD) to measure the distance between different sparse neural networks. Further, we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can outperform over-parameterized models in terms of performance, even without any further structure optimization. To the end, we also show that adaptive sparse connectivity can always unveil a plenitude of sparse sub-networks with very different topologies which outperform the dense model, by quantifying and comparing their topological evolutionary processes. The latter findings complement the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis by showing that there is a much more efficient and robust way to find ""winning tickets"". Altogether, our results start enabling a better theoretical understanding of sparse neural networks, and demonstrate the utility of using graph theory to analyze them."

Most existing works have tried to achieve this using different types of metric objectives and hard sample mining strategies with given training data. However, learning with only the training data can be overfitted to the seen classes, leading to the lack of generalization capability on unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose a simple regularizer called Proxy Synthesis that exploits synthetic classes for stronger generalization in deep metric learning. The proposed method generates synthetic embeddings and proxies that work as synthetic classes, and they mimic unseen classes when computing proxy-based losses. Proxy Synthesis derives an embedding space considering class relations and smooth decision boundaries for robustness on unseen classes. Our method is applicable to any proxy-based losses, including softmax and its variants. Extensive experiments on four famous benchmarks in image retrieval tasks demonstrate that Proxy Synthesis significantly boosts the performance of proxy-based losses and achieves state-of-the-art performance."

Most existing approaches relying on adequate context for long text EL are not effective for the concise and sparse short text. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Multi-turn Multiple-choice Machine reading comprehension (M3}) to solve the short text EL from a new perspective: a query is generated for each ambiguous mention exploiting its surrounding context, and an option selection module is employed to identify the golden entity from candidates using the query. In this way, M3 framework sufficiently interacts limited context with candidate entities during the encoding process, as well as implicitly considers the dissimilarities inside the candidate bunch in the selection stage. In addition, we design a two-stage verifier incorporated into M3 to address the commonly existed unlinkable problem in short text. To further consider the topical coherence and interdependence among referred entities, M3 leverages a multi-turn fashion to deal with mentions in a sequence manner by retrospecting historical cues. Evaluation shows that our M3 framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on five Chinese and English datasets for the real-world short text EL."

A common way for user modeling is to learn user representations that can be distinguished by their interests or preferences. In this work, we focus on developing universal user representation model. The obtained universal representations are expected to contain rich information, and be applicable to various downstream applications without further modifications (e.g., user preference prediction and user profiling). Accordingly, we can be free from the heavy work of training task-specific models for every downstream task as in previous works. In specific, we propose Self-supervised User Modeling Network (SUMN) to encode behavior data into the universal representation. It includes two key components. The first one is a new learning objective, which guides the model to fully identify and preserve valuable user information under a self-supervised learning framework. The other one is a multi-hop aggregation layer, which benefits the model capacity in aggregating diverse behaviors.

Existing metrics such as BLEU show a low correlation with human judgment. We propose a novel and powerful learning-based evaluation metric: Perception Score. The method measures the overall quality of the generation and scores holistically instead of only focusing on one evaluation criteria, such as word overlapping. Moreover, it also shows the amount of uncertainty about its evaluation result. By connecting the uncertainty, Perception Score gives a more accurate evaluation for the generation system. Perception Score provides state-of-the-art results on two conditional generation tasks and two unconditional generation tasks."

However, existing methods usually view the dialogue context as a linear sequence of tokens and learn to generate the next word through token-level self-attention. Such token-level encoding hinders the exploration of discourse-level coherence among utterances. This paper presents DialogBERT, a novel conversational response generation model that enhances previous PLM-based dialogue models. DialogBERT employs a hierarchical Transformer architecture. To efficiently capture the discourse-level coherence among utterances, we propose two training objectives, including masked utterance regression and distributed utterance order ranking in analogy to the original BERT training. Experiments on three multi-turn conversation datasets show that our approach remarkably outperforms the baselines, such as BART and DialoGPT, in terms of quantitative evaluation. The human evaluation suggests that DialogBERT generates more coherent, informative, and human-like responses than the baselines with significant margins."

To combat poaching, rangers patrol expansive protected areas for illegal poaching activity. However, rangers often cannot comprehensively search such large parks. Thus, the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS) was introduced as a machine learning approach to help identify the areas with highest poaching risk. As PAWS is deployed to parks around the world, we recognized that many parks have limited resources for data collection and therefore have scarce feature sets. To ensure under-resourced parks have access to meaningful poaching predictions, we introduce the use of publicly available remote sensing data to extract features for parks. By employing this data from Google Earth Engine, we also incorporate previously unavailable dynamic data to enrich predictions with seasonal trends. We automate the entire data-to-deployment pipeline and find that, with only using publicly available data, we recuperate prediction performance comparable to predictions made using features manually computed by park specialists. We conclude that the inclusion of satellite imagery creates a robust system through which parks of any resource level can benefit from poaching risks for years to come."
612,aaai,2021,Label Confusion Learning to Enhance Text Classification Models,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17529,"Representing a true label as a one-hot vector is a common practice in training text classification models. However, the one-hot representation may not adequately reflect the relation between the instances and labels, as labels are often not completely independent and instances may relate to multiple labels in practice. The inadequate one-hot representations tend to train the model to be over-confident, which may result in arbitrary prediction and model overfitting, especially for confused datasets (datasets with very similar labels) or noisy datasets (datasets with labeling errors). While training models with label smoothing (LS) can ease this problem in some degree, it still fails to capture the realistic relation among labels. In this paper, we propose a novel Label Confusion Model (LCM) as an enhancement component to current popular text classification models. LCM can learn label confusion to capture semantic overlap among labels by calculating the similarity between instances and labels during training and generate a better label distribution to replace the original one-hot label vector, thus improving the final classification performance. Extensive experiments on five text classification benchmark datasets reveal the effectiveness of LCM for several widely used deep learning classification models. Further experiments also verify that LCM is especially helpful for confused or noisy datasets and superior to the label smoothing method."
613,aaai,2021,Hierarchical Graph Convolution Network for Traffic Forecasting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16088,"Traffic forecasting is an indispensable part of Intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and long-term network-wide accurate traffic speed forecasting is one of the most challenging tasks. Recently, deep learning methods have become popular in this domain. As traffic data are physically associated with road networks, most proposed models treat it as a spatiotemporal graph modeling problem and use Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based methods. These GCN-based models highly depend on a predefined and fixed adjacent matrix to reflect the spatial dependency. However, the predefined fixed adjacent matrix is limited in reflecting the actual dependence of traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel model, Traffic Transformer, for spatial-temporal graph modeling and long-term traffic forecasting to overcome these limitations. Transformer is the most popular framework in Natural Language Processing (NLP). And by adapting it to the spatiotemporal problem, Traffic Transformer hierarchically extracts spatiotemporal features through data dynamically by multi-head attention and masked multi-head attention mechanism, and fuse these features for traffic forecasting. Furthermore, analyzing the attention weight matrixes can find the influential part of road networks, allowing us to learn the traffic networks better. Experimental results on the public traffic network datasets and real-world traffic network datasets generated by ourselves demonstrate our proposed model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art ones."

Our approach takes as input a RGB-D sequence and a dense coarse mesh reconstructed from it, and generates a lightweight, low-polygonal mesh with clear face textures and sharp features without losing geometry details from the original scene. Compared to existing methods which only cover large planar regions in the scene, our method builds the entire scene by adaptive planes without losing geometry details and also preserves sharp features in the mesh. Experiments show that our method is more efficient to generate textured mesh from RGB-D data than state-of-the-arts."

To address this issue, we present a novel framework for boosting neural semantic parsers via iterative utterance segmentation. Given an input utterance, our framework iterates between two neural modules: a segmenter for segmenting a span from the utterance, and a parser for mapping the span into a partial meaning representation. Then, these intermediate parsing results are composed into the final meaning representation. One key advantage is that this framework does not require any handcraft templates or additional labeled data for utterance segmentation: we achieve this through proposing a novel training method, in which the parser provides pseudo supervision for the segmenter. Experiments on Geo, ComplexWebQuestions, and Formulas show that our framework can consistently improve performances of neural semantic parsers in different domains. On data splits that require compositional generalization, our framework brings significant accuracy gains: Geo 63.1 to 81.2, Formulas 59.7 to 72.7, ComplexWebQuestions 27.1 to 56.3."

The issue with analysis of any one mode of expression (Visual, Verbal or Vocal) is that lot of contextual information can get lost. This asks researchers to inspect multiple modalities to get a thorough understanding of the cross-modal dependencies and temporal context of the situation to analyze the expression. This work attempts at preserving the long-range dependencies within and across different modalities, which would be bottle-necked by the use of recurrent networks and adds the concept of delta-attention to focus on local differences per modality to capture the idiosyncrasy of different people. We explore a cross-attention fusion technique to get the global view of the emotion expressed through these delta-self-attended modalities, in order to fuse all the local nuances and global context together. The addition of attention is new to the multi-modal fusion field and currently being scrutinized for on what stage the attention mechanism should be used, this work achieves competitive accuracy for overall and per-class classification which is close to the current state-of-the-art with almost half number of parameters."
617,aaai,2021,Automated Lay Language Summarization of Biomedical Scientific Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16089,"Health literacy has emerged as a crucial factor in making appropriate health decisions and ensuring treatment outcomes. However, medical jargon and the complex structure of professional language in this domain make health information especially hard to interpret. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for automated methods to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature to the general population. This problem can be framed as a type of translation problem between the language of healthcare professionals, and that of the general public. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of automated generation of lay language summaries of biomedical scientific reviews, and construct a dataset to support the development and evaluation of automated methods through which to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature. We conduct analyses of the various challenges in solving this task, including not only summarization of the key points but also explanation of background knowledge and simplification of professional language. We experiment with state-of-the-art summarization models as well as several data augmentation techniques, and evaluate their performance using both automated metrics and human assessment. Results indicate that automatically generated summaries produced using contemporary neural architectures can achieve promising quality and readability as compared with reference summaries developed for the lay public by experts (best ROUGE-L of 50.24 and Flesch-Kincaid readability score of 13.30). We also discuss the limitations of the current attempt, providing insights and directions for future work."

Existing deraining methods usually make heuristic assumptions of the rain model, which compels them to employ complex optimization or iterative refinement for high recovery quality. This, however, leads to time-consuming methods and affects the effectiveness for addressing rain patterns deviated from from the assumptions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient deraining method by formulating deraining as a predictive filtering problem without complex rain model assumptions. Specifically, we identify spatially-variant predictive filtering (SPFilt) that adaptively predicts proper kernels via a deep network to filter different individual pixels. Since the filtering can be implemented via well-accelerated convolution, our method can be significantly efficient. We further propose the EfDeRain+ that contains three main contributions to address residual rain traces, multi-scale, and diverse rain patterns without harming the efficiency. First, we propose the uncertainty-aware cascaded predictive filtering (UC-PFilt) that can identify the difficulties of reconstructing clean pixels via predicted kernels and remove the residual rain traces effectively. Second, we design the weight-sharing multi-scale dilated filtering (WS-MS-DFilt) to handle multi-scale rain streaks without harming the efficiency. Third, to eliminate the gap across diverse rain patterns, we propose a novel data augmentation method (i.e., RainMix) to train our deep models. By combining all contributions with sophisticated analysis on different variants, our final method outperforms baseline methods on four single-image deraining datasets and one video deraining dataset in terms of both recovery quality and speed."

Among the various partition strategies, edge partition has demonstrated more promising performance in power-law graphs than vertex partition and thereby has been more widely adopted as the default partition strategy by existing graph systems. The graph edge partition problem, which is to split the edge set into multiple balanced parts to minimize the total number of copied vertices, has been widely studied from the view of optimization and algorithms. In this paper, we study local search algorithms for this problem to further improve the partition results from existing methods. More specifically, we propose two novel concepts, namely adjustable edges and blocks. Based on these, we develop a greedy heuristic as well as an improved search algorithm utilizing the property of the max-flow model. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we first provide adequate theoretical analysis in terms of the approximation quality. We significantly improve the previously known approximation ratio for this problem. Then we conduct extensive experiments on a large number of benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art edge partition strategies. The results show that our proposed local search framework can further improve the quality of graph partition by a wide margin."

In this paper, we revisit iterative back-translation, a simple yet effective semi-supervised method, to investigate whether and how it can improve compositional generalization. In this work: (1) We first empirically show that iterative back-translation substantially improves the performance on compositional generalization benchmarks (CFQ and SCAN). (2) To understand why iterative back-translation is useful, we carefully examine the performance gains and find that iterative back-translation can increasingly correct errors in pseudo-parallel data. (3) To further encourage this mechanism, we propose curriculum iterative back-translation, which better improves the quality of pseudo-parallel data, thus further improving the performance."

To address this issue, our main contribution in this paper is to propose an effective approach to learn a low dimensional gaze representation without gaze annotations, which to the best of our best knowledge, is the first work to do so. The main idea is to rely on a gaze redirection network and use the gaze representation difference of the input and target images (of the redirection network) as the redirection variable. A redirection loss in image domain allows the joint training of both the redirection network and the gaze representation network. In addition, we propose a warping field regularization which not only provides an explicit physical meaning to the gaze representations but also avoids redirection distortions. Promising results on few-shot gaze estimation (competitive results can be achieved with as few as <= 100 calibration samples), cross-dataset gaze estimation, gaze network pretraining, and another task (head pose estimation) demonstrate the validity of our framework."
622,aaai,2021,Reinforcement Based Learning on Classification Task Yields Better Generalization and Adversarial Accuracy (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17893,"Deep Learning has become interestingly popular in computer vision, mostly attaining near or above human-level performance in various vision tasks. But recent work has also demonstrated that these deep neural networks are very vulnerable to adversarial examples (adversarial examples - inputs to a model which are naturally similar to original data but fools the model in classifying it into a wrong class). Humans are very robust against such perturbations; one possible reason could be that humans do not learn to classify based on an error between ""target label"" and ""predicted label"" but possibly due to reinforcements that they receive on their predictions. In this work, we proposed a novel method to train deep learning models on an image classification task. We used a reward-based optimization function, similar to the vanilla policy gradient method used in reinforcement learning, to train our model instead of conventional cross-entropy loss. An empirical evaluation on the cifar10 dataset showed that our method learns a more robust classifier than the same model architecture trained using cross-entropy loss function (on adversarial training). At the same time, our method shows a better generalization with the difference in test accuracy and train accuracy $< 2\%$ for most of the time compared to the cross-entropy one, whose difference most of the time remains $> 2\%$."
623,aaai,2021,Controllable Guarantees for Fair Outcomes via Contrastive Information Estimation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16931,"Controlling bias in training datasets is vital for ensuring equal treatment, or parity, between different groups in downstream applications. A naive solution is to transform the data so that it is statistically independent of group membership, but this may throw away too much information when a reasonable compromise between fairness and accuracy is desired. Another common approach is to limit the ability of a particular adversary who seeks to maximize parity. Unfortunately, representations produced by adversarial approaches may still retain biases as their efficacy is tied to the complexity of the adversary used during training. To this end, we theoretically establish that by limiting the mutual information between representations and protected attributes, we can assuredly control the parity of any downstream classifier. We demonstrate an effective method for controlling parity through mutual information based on contrastive information estimators and show that they outperform approaches that rely on variational bounds based on complex generative models. We test our approach on UCI Adult and Heritage Health datasets and demonstrate that our approach provides more informative representations across a range of desired parity thresholds while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the parity of any downstream algorithm."

We define simple heuristics to construct such examples. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art models consistently fail to recognize them as ill-formed, and instead produce high confidence predictions on them. As a consequence of this phenomenon, models trained on sentences with randomly permuted word order perform close to state-of-the-art models. To alleviate these issues, we show that if models are explicitly trained to recognize invalid inputs, they can be robust to such attacks without a drop in performance."

We demonstrate the performance of these approaches relative to the SSVI industry standard. The GP approach is proven arbitrage-free, whereas arbitrages are only penalized under the SSVI and NN approaches. The GP approach obtains the best out-of-sample calibration error and provides uncertainty quantification.The NN approach yields a smoother local volatility and a better backtesting performance, as its training criterion incorporates a local volatility regularization term."

Automating figure caption generation helps move model understandings of scientific documents beyond text and will help authors write informative captions that facilitate communicating scientific findings. Unlike previous studies, we reframe scientific figure captioning as a knowledge-augmented image captioning task that models need to utilize knowledge embedded across modalities for caption generation. To this end, we extended the large-scale SciCap dataset~\cite{hsu-etal-2021-scicap-generating} to SciCap+ which includes mention-paragraphs (paragraphs mentioning figures) and OCR tokens. Then, we conduct experiments with the M4C-Captioner (a multimodal transformer-based model with a pointer network) as a baseline for our study. Our results indicate that mention-paragraphs serves as additional context knowledge, which significantly boosts the automatic standard image caption evaluation scores compared to the figure-only baselines. Human evaluations further reveal the challenges of generating figure captions that are informative to readers. The code and SciCap+ dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/ZhishenYang/scientific_figure_captioning_dataset"

Existing methods are effective in highlighting the regions that affect the resulting classification the most. However, as we show, these methods are limited in their ability to identify the support for alternative classifications, an effect we name {\em the saliency bias} hypothesis. In this work, we integrate two lines of research: gradient-based methods and attribution-based methods, and develop an algorithm that provides per-class explainability. The algorithm back-projects the per pixel local influence, in a manner that is guided by the local attributions, while correcting for salient features that would otherwise bias the explanation. In an extensive battery of experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our methods to class-specific visualization, and not just the predicted label. Remarkably, the method obtains state of the art results in benchmarks that are commonly applied to gradient-based methods as well as in those that are employed mostly for evaluating attribution methods. Using a new unsupervised procedure, our method is also successful in demonstrating that self-supervised methods learn semantic information."

Rather than training networks for different tasks independently, we adapt the training process to produce network components that are compatible across tasks. In particular, we split a network into two components, a features extractor and a target task head, and propose various approaches to accomplish compatibility between them. We systematically analyse these approaches on the task of image classification on standard datasets. We demonstrate that we can produce components which are directly compatible without any fine-tuning or compromising accuracy on the original tasks. Afterwards, we demonstrate the use of compatible components on three applications: Unsupervised domain adaptation, transferring classifiers across feature extractors with different architectures, and increasing the computational efficiency of transfer learning."

This paper proposes novel methods to solve the high dimensional LSE problems using Bayesian Neural Networks. In particular, we consider two types of LSE problems: (1) \textit{explicit} LSE problem where the threshold level is a fixed user-specified value, and, (2) \textit{implicit} LSE problem where the threshold level is defined as a percentage of the (unknown) maximum of the objective function. For each problem, we derive the corresponding theoretic information based acquisition function to sample the data points so as to maximally increase the level set accuracy. Furthermore, we also analyse the theoretical time complexity of our proposed acquisition functions, and suggest a practical methodology to efficiently tune the network hyper-parameters to achieve high model accuracy. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed method can achieve better results compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches."

Presentation attacks can be performed by fabricating the fake fingerprint of a user with or without the intention of the subject. This paper presents a dynamic ensemble of deep learning and handcrafted features to detect presentation attacks in known-material and unknown-material protocols. The proposed model is a dynamic ensemble of deep CNN and handcrafted features empowered deep neural networks both of which learn their parameters together. The proposed presentation attack detection model, in this way, utilizes the capabilities of both classification techniques and exhibits better performance than their individual results. The proposed model's performance is validated using benchmark LivDet 2015, 2017, and 2019 databases, with an overall accuracy of 96.10\%, 96.49\%, and 95.99\% attained on them, respectively.

SVBMC reuses all existing target density evaluations -- for example, from previous optimizations or partial Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs -- to build a sparse Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model of the log posterior density. Uncertain regions of the surrogate are then refined via active learning as needed. Our work builds on the Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) framework for sample-efficient inference, with several novel contributions. First, we make VBMC scalable to a large number of pre-existing evaluations via sparse GP regression, deriving novel Bayesian quadrature formulae and acquisition functions for active learning with sparse GPs. Second, we introduce noise shaping, a general technique to induce the sparse GP approximation to focus on high posterior density regions. Third, we prove theoretical results in support of the SVBMC refinement procedure. We validate our method on a variety of challenging synthetic scenarios and real-world applications. We find that SVBMC consistently builds good posterior approximations by post-processing of existing model evaluations from different sources, often requiring only a small number of additional density evaluations."
632,aaai,2021,GAN Ensemble for Anomaly Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16530,"When formulated as an unsupervised learning problem, anomaly detection often requires a model to learn the distribution of normal data. Previous works apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to anomaly detection tasks and show good performances from these models. Motivated by the observation that GAN ensembles often outperform single GANs in generation tasks, we propose to construct GAN ensembles for anomaly detection. In the proposed method, a group of generators and a group of discriminators are trained together, so every generator gets feedback from multiple discriminators, and vice versa. Compared to a single GAN, a GAN ensemble can better model the distribution of normal data and thus better detect anomalies. Our theoretical analysis of GANs and GAN ensembles explains the role of a GAN discriminator in anomaly detection. In the empirical study, we evaluate ensembles constructed from four types of base models, and the results show that these ensembles clearly outperform single models in a series of tasks of anomaly detection."

Though many efforts have been made for air quality or weather prediction, most of them simply employ one another as feature input, which ignores the inner-connection between two predictive tasks. On the one hand, the accurate prediction of one task can help improve another task's performance. On the other hand, geospatially distributed air quality and weather monitoring stations provide additional hints for city-wide spatiotemporal dependency modeling. Inspired by the above two insights, in this paper, we propose the Multi-adversarial spatiotemporal recurrent Graph Neural Networks (MasterGNN) for joint air quality and weather predictions. Specifically, we first propose a heterogeneous recurrent graph neural network to model the spatiotemporal autocorrelation among air quality and weather monitoring stations. Then, we develop a multi-adversarial graph learning framework to against observation noise propagation introduced by spatiotemporal modeling. Moreover, we present an adaptive training strategy by formulating multi-adversarial learning as a multi-task learning problem. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that MasterGNN achieves the best performance compared with seven baselines on both air quality and weather prediction tasks."

In this paper, we study such linear explanations produced either post-hoc by a few recent methods or generated along with predictions with contextual explanation networks (CENs). We focus on two questions: (i) whether linear explanations are always consistent or can be misleading, and (ii) when integrated into the prediction process, whether and how explanations affect the performance of the model. Our analysis sheds more light on certain properties of explanations produced by different methods and suggests that learning models that explain and predict jointly is often advantageous."

The detection task unifies all persons while the re-id task discriminates different identities, resulting in conflict optimal objectives. Existing works proposed to decouple end-to-end person search to alleviate such conflict. Yet these methods are still sub-optimal on one or two of the sub-tasks due to their partially decoupled models, which limits the overall person search performance. In this paper, we propose to fully decouple person search towards optimal person search. A task-incremental person search network is proposed to incrementally construct an end-to-end model for the detection and re-id sub-task, which decouples the model architecture for the two sub-tasks. The proposed task-incremental network allows task-incremental training for the two conflicting tasks. This enables independent learning for different objectives thus fully decoupled the model for persons earch. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fully decoupled models for end-to-end person search."

Many studies have been devoted to finding diverse solutions. Baste et al. (Algorithms 2019, IJCAI 2020) recently initiated the study of computing diverse solutions of combinatorial problems from the perspective of fixed-parameter tractability. They considered problems of finding $r$ solutions that maximize some diversity measures (the minimum or sum of the pairwise Hamming distances among them) and gave some fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for the diverse version of several well-known problems, such as {\sc Vertex Cover}, {\sc Feedback Vertex Set}, {\sc $d$-Hitting Set}, and problems on bounded-treewidth graphs. In this work, we investigate the (fixed-parameter) tractability of problems of finding diverse spanning trees, paths, and several subgraphs. In particular, we show that, given a graph $G$ and an integer $r$, the problem of computing $r$ spanning trees of $G$ maximizing the sum of the pairwise Hamming distances among them can be solved in polynomial time. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time solvable case for finding diverse solutions of unbounded size."

Recent emergence of Transformer networks, which replace convolution layers with self-attention blocks, has revealed the limitation of stationary convolution kernels and opened the door to the era of dynamic feature transforms. The existing dynamic transforms, including self-attention, however, are all limited for video understanding where correspondence relations in space and time, i.e., motion information, are crucial for effective representation. In this work, we introduce a relational feature transform, dubbed the relational self-attention (RSA), that leverages rich structures of spatio-temporal relations in videos by dynamically generating relational kernels and aggregating relational contexts. Our experiments and ablation studies show that the RSA network substantially outperforms convolution and self-attention counterparts, achieving the state of the art on the standard motion-centric benchmarks for video action recognition, such as Something-Something-V1 & V2, Diving48, and FineGym."

Counterfactual story rewriting is a recently proposed task to test the causal reasoning ability for text generation models, which requires a model to predict the corresponding story ending when the condition is modified to a counterfactual one. Previous works have shown that the traditional sequence-to-sequence model cannot well handle this problem, as it often captures some spurious correlations between the original and counterfactual endings, instead of the causal relations between conditions and endings. To address this issue, we propose a sketch-and-customize generation model guided by the causality implicated in the conditions and endings. In the sketch stage, a skeleton is extracted by removing words which are conflict to the counterfactual condition, from the original ending. In the customize stage, a generation model is used to fill proper words in the skeleton under the guidance of the counterfactual condition. In this way, the obtained counterfactual ending is both relevant to the original ending and consistent with the counterfactual condition. Experimental results show that the proposed model generates much better endings, as compared with the traditional sequence-to-sequence model."

Some popular algorithms using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for semi-supervised classification share a single architecture for classification and discrimination. However, this may require a model to converge to a separate data distribution for each task, which may reduce overall performance. While progress in semi-supervised learning has been made, less addressed are small-scale, fully-supervised tasks where even unlabeled data is unavailable and unattainable. We therefore, propose a novel GAN model namely External Classifier GAN (EC-GAN), that utilizes GANs and semi-supervised algorithms to improve classification in fully-supervised regimes. Our method leverages a GAN to generate artificial data used to supplement supervised classification. More specifically, we attach an external classifier, hence the name EC-GAN, to the GAN's generator, as opposed to sharing an architecture with the discriminator. Our experiments demonstrate that EC-GAN's performance is comparable to the shared architecture method, far superior to the standard data augmentation and regularization-based approach, and effective on a small, realistic dataset."

Generating a spherical image from a single normal-field-of-view (NFOV) image is convenient and considerably expands the usage scenarios because there is no need to use a specific panoramic camera or take images from multiple directions; however, it is still a challenging and unsolved problem. The primary challenge is controlling the high degree of freedom involved in generating a wide area that includes the all directions of the desired plausible spherical image. On the other hand, scene symmetry is a basic property of the global structure of the spherical images, such as rotation symmetry, plane symmetry and asymmetry. We propose a method to generate spherical image from a single NFOV image, and control the degree of freedom of the generated regions using scene symmetry. We incorporate scene-symmetry parameters as latent variables into conditional variational autoencoders, following which we learn the conditional probability of spherical images for NFOV images and scene symmetry. Furthermore, the probability density functions are represented using neural networks, and scene symmetry is implemented using both circular shift and flip of the hidden variables. Our experiments show that the proposed method can generate various plausible spherical images, controlled from symmetric to asymmetric."

HUSPM is useful for several applications such as market basket analysis, marketing, and website clickstream analysis. In these applications, users may also consider high utility patterns frequently appearing in the dataset to obtain more fruitful information. However, this task is high computation since algorithms may generate a combinatorial explosive number of candidates that may be redundant or of low importance. To reduce complexity and obtain a compact set of frequent high utility sequential patterns (FHUSPs), this paper proposes an algorithm named CHUSP for mining closed frequent high utility sequential patterns (CHUSPs). Such patterns keep a concise representation while preserving the same expressive power of the complete set of FHUSPs. The proposed algorithm relies on a CHUS data structure to maintain information during mining. It uses three pruning strategies to eliminate early low-utility and non-frequent patterns, thereby reducing the search space. An extensive experimental evaluation was performed on six real-life datasets to evaluate the performance of CHUSP in terms of execution time, memory usage, and the number of generated patterns. Experimental results show that CHUSP can efficiently discover the compact set of CHUSPs under different user-defined thresholds."

The few existing datasets for humor are mostly in English. However, due to the tremendous growth in multilingual content, there is a great demand to build models and systems that support multilingual information access. To this end, we propose a dataset for Multimodal Multiparty Hindi Humor (M2H2) recognition in conversations containing 6,191 utterances from 13 episodes of a very popular TV series ""Shrimaan Shrimati Phir Se"". Each utterance is annotated with humor/non-humor labels and encompasses acoustic, visual, and textual modalities. We propose several strong multimodal baselines and show the importance of contextual and multimodal information for humor recognition in conversations. The empirical results on M2H2 dataset demonstrate that multimodal information complements unimodal information for humor recognition. The dataset and the baselines are available at http://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/resources.html and https://github.com/declare-lab/M2H2-dataset."

Our method employs a novel algorithm for synthesis of compact automata to uncover this sequential structure automatically. We synthesise a human-interpretable automaton from trace data collected by exploring the environment. The state space of the environment is then enriched with the synthesised automaton so that the generation of a control policy by deep RL is guided by the discovered structure encoded in the automaton. The proposed approach is able to cope with both high-dimensional, low-level features and unknown sparse non-Markovian rewards. We have evaluated DeepSynth's performance in a set of experiments that includes the Atari game Montezuma's Revenge. Compared to existing approaches, we obtain a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the number of iterations required for policy synthesis, and also a significant improvement in scalability."

For molecular liquids, however, it always takes place in a supercooled liquid state metastable against crystallization, which has led to a number of serious debates concerning its origin: liquid-liquid transition vs. unusual nano-crystal formation. Thus, there have so far been no single example free from such debates. Here we show the first firm experimental evidence that the transition is truly liquid-liquid transition and not nano-crystallization for a molecular liquid, triphenyl phosphite. We kinetically isolate the reverse liquid-liquid transition from glass transition and crystallization with an extremely high heating rate of flash differential scanning calorimetry, and prove the reversibility and first-order nature of liquid-liquid transition. Our finding not only deepens our physical understanding of liquid-liquid transition but also will initiate a new phase of its research from both fundamental and applications viewpoints."
645,aaai,2021,Learning with Safety Constraints: Sample Complexity of Reinforcement Learning for Constrained MDPs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16937,"Practical reinforcement learning problems are often formulated as constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problems, in which the agent has to maximize the expected return while satisfying a set of prescribed safety constraints. In this study, we propose a novel simulator-based method to approximately solve a CMDP problem without making any compromise on the safety constraints. We achieve this by decomposing the CMDP into a pair of MDPs; reconnaissance MDP and planning MDP. The purpose of reconnaissance MDP is to evaluate the set of actions that are safe, and the purpose of planning MDP is to maximize the return while using the actions authorized by reconnaissance MDP. RMDP can define a set of safe policies for any given set of safety constraint, and this set of safe policies can be used to solve another CMDP problem with different reward. Our method is not only computationally less demanding than the previous simulator-based approaches to CMDP, but also capable of finding a competitive reward-seeking policy in a high dimensional environment, including those involving multiple moving obstacles."
646,aaai,2021,Expected Eligibility Traces,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i11.17200,"The question of how to determine which states and actions are responsible for a certain outcome is known as the credit assignment problem and remains a central research question in reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence. Eligibility traces enable efficient credit assignment to the recent sequence of states and actions experienced by the agent, but not to counterfactual sequences that could also have led to the current state. In this work, we introduce expected eligibility traces. Expected traces allow, with a single update, to update states and actions that could have preceded the current state, even if they did not do so on this occasion. We discuss when expected traces provide benefits over classic (instantaneous) traces in temporal-difference learning, and show that sometimes substantial improvements can be attained. We provide a way to smoothly interpolate between instantaneous and expected traces by a mechanism similar to bootstrapping, which ensures that the resulting algorithm is a strict generalisation of TD($\lambda$). Finally, we discuss possible extensions and connections to related ideas, such as successor features."
647,aaai,2021,Consistent-Separable Feature Representation for Semantic Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16244,"Zero-shot learning has been actively studied for image classification task to relieve the burden of annotating image labels. Interestingly, semantic segmentation task requires more labor-intensive pixel-wise annotation, but zero-shot semantic segmentation has only attracted limited research interest. Thus, we focus on zero-shot semantic segmentation, which aims to segment unseen objects with only category-level semantic representations provided for unseen categories. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-aware feature Generation Network (CaGNet), which can synthesize context-aware pixel-wise visual features for unseen categories based on category-level semantic representations and pixel-wise contextual information. The synthesized features are used to finetune the classifier to enable segmenting unseen objects. Furthermore, we extend pixel-wise feature generation and finetuning to patch-wise feature generation and finetuning, which additionally considers inter-pixel relationship. Experimental results on Pascal-VOC, Pascal-Context, and COCO-stuff show that our method significantly outperforms the existing zero-shot semantic segmentation methods.

Despite of dramatic progresses in the area of video classification research, a severe problem faced by the community is that the detailed understanding of human actions is ignored. Our motivation is that parsing human actions needs to build models that focus on the specific problem. We present a simple yet effective approach, named disentangled action parsing (DAP). Specifically, we divided the part-level action parsing into three stages: 1) person detection, where a person detector is adopted to detect all persons from videos as well as performs instance-level action recognition; 2) Part parsing, where a part-parsing model is proposed to recognize human parts from detected person images; and 3) Action parsing, where a multi-modal action parsing network is used to parse action category conditioning on all detection results that are obtained from previous stages. With these three major models applied, our approach of DAP records a global mean of $0.605$ score in 2021 Kinetics-TPS Challenge."

Machine learning models are becoming exceptionally powerful at climate forecasting, but methodological gaps remain in terms of facilitating anticipatory action. Here we provide an overview of anticipatory action, review relevant applications of machine learning, identify common challenges, and highlight areas where machine learning can uniquely contribute to advancing disaster response for populations most vulnerable to climate change."

Firstly, existing methods achieve state-of-the-art performance based on different backbones and kinds of training tricks. We collect different backbones and training tricks and evaluate the impact of changing them and develop an efficient pipeline for crowd counting, which decreases MAE and RMSE significantly on multiple datasets. We also propose a clustering algorithm named isolated KMeans to locate the heads in density maps. This method can divide the density maps into subregions and find the centers under local count constraints without training any parameter and can be integrated with existing methods easily."

The system is an example of a learning-apprentice software- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and semantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface. Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the interface, an agent acts for the user.

Because its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, it is crucial to accurately and quickly detect COVID-19 infection. Many recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans. However, most existing work focuses on 2D datasets, which may result in low quality models as the real CT scans are 3D images. Besides, the reported results span a broad spectrum on different datasets with a relatively unfair comparison. In this paper, we first use three state-of-the-art 3D models (ResNet3D101, DenseNet3D121, and MC3\_18) to establish the baseline performance on the three publicly available chest CT scan datasets. Then we propose a differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework to automatically search for the 3D DL models for 3D chest CT scans classification with the Gumbel Softmax technique to improve the searching efficiency. We further exploit the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) technique on our models to provide the interpretability of the results. The experimental results show that our automatically searched models (CovidNet3D) outperform the baseline human-designed models on the three datasets with tens of times smaller model size and higher accuracy. Furthermore, the results also verify that CAM can be well applied in CovidNet3D for COVID-19 datasets to provide interpretability for medical diagnosis."

However, the extra latency and memory costs introduced by this approach may make it unacceptable for efficiency-constrained applications. It has recently been shown for bilingual translation that using a deep encoder and shallow decoder (DESD) can reduce inference latency while maintaining translation quality, so we study similar speed-accuracy trade-offs for multilingual translation. We find that for many-to-one translation we can indeed increase decoder speed without sacrificing quality using this approach, but for one-to-many translation, shallow decoders cause a clear quality drop. To ameliorate this drop, we propose a deep encoder with multiple shallow decoders (DEMSD) where each shallow decoder is responsible for a disjoint subset of target languages. Specifically, the DEMSD model with 2-layer decoders is able to obtain a 1.8x speedup on average compared to a standard transformer model with no drop in translation quality."

A popular technique to overcome the negative effects of these noisy labels is noise modelling where the underlying noise process is modelled. In this work, we study the quality of these estimated noise models from the theoretical side by deriving the expected error of the noise model. Apart from evaluating the theoretical results on commonly used synthetic noise, we also publish NoisyNER, a new noisy label dataset from the NLP domain that was obtained through a realistic distant supervision technique. It provides seven sets of labels with differing noise patterns to evaluate different noise levels on the same instances. Parallel, clean labels are available making it possible to study scenarios where a small amount of gold-standard data can be leveraged. Our theoretical results and the corresponding experiments give insights into the factors that influence the noise model estimation like the noise distribution and the sampling technique."

The marketplace allows the suppliers to list their goods and facilitates matching between buyers and sellers. In return, such a marketplace typically charges fees for facilitating trade. The goal of this work is to design a dynamic fee schedule for the marketplace that is equitable and profitable to all traders while being profitable to the marketplace at the same time (from charging fees). Since the traders adapt their strategies to the fee schedule, we present a reinforcement learning framework for simultaneously learning a marketplace fee schedule and trading strategies that adapt to this fee schedule using a weighted optimization objective of profits and equitability. We illustrate the use of the proposed approach in detail on a simulated stock exchange with different types of investors, specifically market makers and consumer investors. As we vary the equitability weights across different investor classes, we see that the learnt exchange fee schedule starts favoring the class of investors with the highest weight. We further discuss the observed insights from the simulated stock exchange in light of the general framework of equitable marketplace mechanism design."

It introduces uncertainty both by physical randomization and by incomplete information about opponents hands.Another source OF uncertainty IS the limited information available TO construct psychological models OF opponents, their tendencies TO bluff, play conservatively, reveal weakness, etc. AND the relation BETWEEN their hand strengths AND betting behaviour. ALL OF these uncertainties must be assessed accurately AND combined effectively FOR ANY reasonable LEVEL OF skill IN the game TO be achieved, since good decision making IS highly sensitive TO those tasks.We describe our Bayesian Poker Program(BPP), which uses a Bayesian network TO model the programs poker hand, the opponents hand AND the opponents playing behaviour conditioned upon the hand, and betting curves which govern play given a probability of winning. The history of play with opponents is used to improve BPPs understanding OF their behaviour.We compare BPP experimentally WITH : a simple RULE - based system; a program which depends exclusively ON hand probabilities(i.e., without opponent modeling); AND WITH human players.BPP has shown itself TO be an effective player against ALL these opponents, barring the better humans.We also sketch out SOME likely ways OF improving play."

However, most methods are designed for verification of an idealized model of the actual network which works over real arithmetic and ignores rounding imprecisions. This idealization is in stark contrast to network quantization, which is a technique that trades numerical precision for computational efficiency and is, therefore, often applied in practice. Neglecting rounding errors of such low-bit quantized neural networks has been shown to lead to wrong conclusions about the network's correctness. Thus, the desired approach for verifying quantized neural networks would be one that takes these rounding errors into account. In this paper, we show that verifying the bit-exact implementation of quantized neural networks with bit-vector specifications is PSPACE-hard, even though verifying idealized real-valued networks and satisfiability of bit-vector specifications alone are each in NP. Furthermore, we explore several practical heuristics toward closing the complexity gap between idealized and bit-exact verification. In particular, we propose three techniques for making SMT-based verification of quantized neural networks more scalable. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods allow a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude over existing approaches."

Against this background, we study the expressive power of neural networks through the example of the classical NP-hard Knapsack Problem. Our main contribution is a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with rectified linear units that are iteratively applied to each item of a Knapsack instance and thereby compute optimal or provably good solution values. We show that an RNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum Knapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum Knapsack solutions. We also prove the following tradeoff between the size of an RNN and the quality of the computed Knapsack solution: for Knapsack instances consisting of $n$ items, an RNN of depth five and width $w$ computes a solution of value at least $1-\mathcal{O}(n^2/\sqrt{w})$ times the optimum solution value. Our results build upon a classical dynamic programming formulation of the Knapsack Problem as well as a careful rounding of profit values that are also at the core of the well-known fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Knapsack Problem. A carefully conducted computational study qualitatively supports our theoretical size bounds. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized to many other combinatorial optimization problems that admit dynamic programming solution methods, such as various Shortest Path Problems, the Longest Common Subsequence Problem, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem."

662,aaai,2021,Towards Fully Automated Manga Translation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17537,"We tackle the problem of machine translation of manga, Japanese comics. Manga translation involves two important problems in machine translation: context-aware and multimodal translation. Since text and images are mixed up in an unstructured fashion in Manga, obtaining context from the image is essential for manga translation. However, it is still an open problem how to extract context from image and integrate into MT models. In addition, corpus and benchmarks to train and evaluate such model is currently unavailable. In this paper, we make the following four contributions that establishes the foundation of manga translation research. First, we propose multimodal context-aware translation framework. We are the first to incorporate context information obtained from manga image. It enables us to translate texts in speech bubbles that cannot be translated without using context information (e.g., texts in other speech bubbles, gender of speakers, etc.). Second, for training the model, we propose the approach to automatic corpus construction from pairs of original manga and their translations, by which large parallel corpus can be constructed without any manual labeling. Third, we created a new benchmark to evaluate manga translation. Finally, on top of our proposed methods, we devised a first comprehensive system for fully automated manga translation."

To address this, we hope to introduce a new method with the base learner, such as Bayesian regression or stochastic gradient descent to solve the problem of the vulnerability in the model. Because the mini-batch gradient descent allows for a more robust convergence than the batch gradient descent, we work a method with the mini-batch gradient descent, called Mini-Batch Gradient Descent with Trimming (MBGDT).

Like Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent reasoning, HTN planning performs hierarchical and context-based refinement of goals into subgoals and basic actions. However, while HTN planners 'lookahead' over the consequences of choosing one refinement over another, BDI agents interleave refinement with acting. There has been renewed interest in making HTN planners behave more like BDI agent systems, e.g. to have a unified representation for acting and planning. However, past work on the subject has remained informal or implementation-focused. This paper is a formal account of 'HTN acting', which supports interleaved deliberation, acting, and failure recovery. We use the syntax of the most general HTN planning formalism and build on its core semantics, and we provide an algorithm which combines our new formalism with the processing of exogenous events. We also study the properties of HTN acting and its relation to HTN planning."

In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a \textit{weakly-supervised} paradigm for learning MWPs. Our method only requires the annotations of the final answers and can generate various solutions for a single problem. To boost weakly-supervised learning, we propose a novel \textit{learning-by-fixing} (LBF) framework, which corrects the misperceptions of the neural network via symbolic reasoning. Specifically, for an incorrect solution tree generated by the neural network, the \textit{fixing} mechanism propagates the error from the root node to the leaf nodes and infers the most probable fix that can be executed to get the desired answer. To generate more diverse solutions, \textit{tree regularization} is applied to guide the efficient shrinkage and exploration of the solution space, and a \textit{memory buffer} is designed to track and save the discovered various fixes for each problem. Experimental results on the Math23K dataset show the proposed LBF framework significantly outperforms reinforcement learning baselines in weakly-supervised learning. Furthermore, it achieves comparable top-1 and much better top-3/5 answer accuracies than fully-supervised methods, demonstrating its strength in producing diverse solutions."

Previous neural solvers of math word problems directly translate problem texts into equations, lacking an explicit interpretation of the situations, and often fail to handle more sophisticated situations. To address such limits of neural solvers, we introduce the concept of a \emph{situation model}, which originates from psychology studies to represent the mental states of humans in problem-solving, and propose \emph{SMART}, which adopts attributed grammar as the representation of situation models for algebra story problems. Specifically, we first train an information extraction module to extract nodes, attributes, and relations from problem texts and then generate a parse graph based on a pre-defined attributed grammar. An iterative learning strategy is also proposed to improve the performance of SMART further. To rigorously study this task, we carefully curate a new dataset named \emph{ASP6.6k}. Experimental results on ASP6.6k show that the proposed model outperforms all previous neural solvers by a large margin while preserving much better interpretability. To test these models' generalization capability, we also design an out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation, in which problems are more complex than those in the training set. Our model exceeds state-of-the-art models by 17\% in the OOD evaluation, demonstrating its superior generalization ability."

However, despite the known benefits, the demonstrations may contain sensitive information about the teacher's training data and existing kickstarting methods do not take any measures to protect it. Therefore, we use the framework of differential privacy to develop a mechanism that securely shares the teacher's demonstrations with the student. The mechanism allows for the teacher to decide upon the accuracy of its demonstrations with respect to the privacy budget that it consumes, thereby granting the teacher full control over its data privacy. We then develop a kickstarted deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the student that is privacy-aware because we calibrate its objective with the parameters of the teacher's privacy mechanism. The privacy-aware design of the algorithm makes it possible to kickstart the student's learning despite the perturbations induced by the privacy mechanism. From numerical experiments, we highlight three empirical results: (i) the algorithm succeeds in expediting the student's learning, (ii) the student converges to a performance level that was not possible without the demonstrations, and (iii) the student maintains its enhanced performance even after the teacher stops sharing useful demonstrations due to its privacy budget constraints."

They are widely studied in game theory, economics, and multiagent systems. Equilibrium concepts are invariant under certain transforms of the payoffs. We define an equilibrium-inspired distance metric for the space of all normal-form games and uncover a distance-preserving equilibrium-invariant embedding. Furthermore, we propose an additional transform which defines a better-response-invariant distance metric and embedding. To demonstrate these metric spaces we study $2\times2$ games. The equilibrium-invariant embedding of $2\times2$ games has an efficient two variable parameterization (a reduction from eight), where each variable geometrically describes an angle on a unit circle. Interesting properties can be spatially inferred from the embedding, including: equilibrium support, cycles, competition, coordination, distances, best-responses, and symmetries. The best-response-invariant embedding of $2\times2$ games, after considering symmetries, rediscovers a set of 15 games, and their respective equivalence classes. We propose that this set of game classes is fundamental and captures all possible interesting strategic interactions in $2\times2$ games. We introduce a directed graph representation and name for each class. Finally, we leverage the tools developed for $2\times2$ games to develop game theoretic visualizations of large normal-form and extensive-form games that aim to fingerprint the strategic interactions that occur within."

In this work, we propose a distance complementary to existing measures: Topology Distance (TD), the main idea behind which is to compare the geometric and topological features of the latent manifold of real data with those of generated data. More specifically, we build Vietoris-Rips complex on image features, and define TD based on the differences in persistent-homology groups of the two manifolds. We compare TD with the most commonly used and relevant measures in the field, including Inception Score (IS), Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and Geometry Score (GS), in a range of experiments on various datasets. We demonstrate the unique advantage and superiority of our proposed approach over the aforementioned metrics. A combination of our empirical results and the theoretical argument we propose in favour of TD, strongly supports the claim that TD is a powerful candidate metric that researchers can employ when aiming to automatically evaluate the goodness of GANs' learning."
670,aaai,2021,Endomorphisms of Classical Planning Tasks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17406,"Planning in robotics is often split into task and motion planning. The high-level, symbolic task planner decides what needs to be done, while the motion planner checks feasibility and fills up geometric detail. It is known however that such a decomposition is not effective in general as the symbolic and geometrical components are not independent. In this work, we show that it is possible to compile task and motion planning problems into classical AI planning problems; i.e., planning problems over finite and discrete state spaces with a known initial state, deterministic actions, and goal states to be reached. The compilation is sound, meaning that classical plans are valid robot plans, and probabilistically complete, meaning that valid robot plans are classical plans when a sufficient number of configurations is sampled. In this approach, motion planners and collision checkers are used for the compilation, but not at planning time. The key elements that make the approach effective are 1) expressive classical AI planning languages for representing the compiled problems in compact form, that unlike PDDL make use of functions and state constraints, and 2) general width-based search algorithms capable of finding plans over huge combinatorial spaces using weak heuristics only. Empirical results are presented for a PR2 robot manipulating tens of objects, for which long plans are required."

For this we build on a recent model of Hosseini et al.[AAAI'21] and focus on the task of eliciting preferences to find matchings which are necessarily optimal, i.e., optimal under all possible completions of the elicited preferences. In particular, we follow the approach of Hosseini et al. and investigate the elicitation of necessarily Pareto optimal (NPO) and necessarily rank-maximal (NRM) matchings. Most importantly, we answer their open question and give an online algorithm for eliciting an NRM matching in the next-best query model which is 3/2-competitive, i.e., it takes at most 3/2 as many queries as an optimal algorithm. Besides this, we extend this field of research by introducing two new natural models of elicitation and by studying both the complexity of determining whether a necessarily optimal matching exists in them, and by giving online algorithms for these models."
672,aaai,2021,It Takes Two to Empathize: One to Seek and One to Provide,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17539,"The design of Nash equilibrium seeking strategies for games in which the involved players are of second-order integrator-type dynamics is investigated in this paper. Noticing that velocity signals are usually noisy or not available for feedback control in practical engineering systems, this paper supposes that the velocity signals are not accessible for the players. To deal with the absence of velocity measurements, two estimators are designed, based on which Nash equilibrium seeking strategies are constructed. The first strategy is established by employing an observer, which has the same order as the players' dynamics, to estimate the unavailable system states (e.g., the players' velocities). The second strategy is designed based on a high-pass filter and is motivated by the incentive to reduce the order of the closed-loop system which in turn reduces the computation costs of the seeking algorithm. Extensions to Nash equilibrium seeking for networked games are provided. Taking the advantages of leader-following consensus protocols, it turns out that both the observer-based method and the filter-based method can be adapted to deal with games in distributed systems, which shows the extensibility of the developed strategies. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is analytically proven that the players' actions can be regulated to the Nash equilibrium point and their velocities can be regulated to zero by utilizing the proposed velocity-free Nash equilibrium seeking strategies. A numerical example is provided for the verifications of the proposed algorithms."

A prominent fairness notion for allocating indivisible items is envy-freeness up to any item (EFX). Yet, its existence and computation has remained a notable open problem. By identifying a class of instances with ""terrible chores"", we show that determining the existence of an EFX allocation is NP-complete. This result immediately implies the intractability of EFX under additive preferences. Nonetheless, we propose a natural subclass of lexicographic preferences for which an EFX and Pareto optimal (PO) allocation is guaranteed to exist and can be computed efficiently for any mixed instance. Focusing on two weaker fairness notions, we investigate finding EF1 and PO allocations for special instances with terrible chores, and show that MMS and PO allocations can be computed efficiently for any mixed instance with lexicographic preferences."

To address this issue, we propose an OOV robust slot filling model based on multi-level data augmentations to solve the OOV problem from both word and slot perspectives. We present a unified contrastive learning framework, which pull representations of the origin sample and augmentation samples together, to make the model resistant to OOV problems. We evaluate the performance of the model from some specific slots and carefully design test data with OOV word perturbation to further demonstrate the effectiveness of OOV words. Experiments on two datasets show that our approach outperforms the previous sota methods in terms of both OOV slots and words."

In this paper, we first extract the runtime Application Programming Interface (API) call sequences from Android apps, and then analyze higher-level semantic relations within the ecosystem to comprehensively characterize the apps. To model different types of entities (i.e., app, API, IMEI, signature, affiliation) and the rich semantic relations among them, we then construct a structural heterogeneous information network (HIN) and present meta-path based approach to depict the relatedness over apps. To efficiently classify nodes (e.g., apps) in the constructed HIN, we propose the HinLearning method to first obtain in-sample node embeddings and then learn representations of out-of-sample nodes without rerunning/adjusting HIN embeddings at the first attempt. Afterwards, we design a deep neural network (DNN) classifier taking the learned HIN representations as inputs for Android malware detection. A comprehensive experimental study on the large-scale real sample collections from Tencent Security Lab is performed to compare various baselines. Promising experimental results demonstrate that our developed system AiDroid which integrates our proposed method outperforms others in real-time Android malware detection. AiDroid has already been incorporated into Tencent Mobile Security product that serves millions of users worldwide."
676,aaai,2021,Gaussian Process Priors for View-Aware Inference,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16948,"We study learning problems in which the conditional distribution of the output given the input varies as a function of additional task variables. In varying-coefficient models with Gaussian process priors, a Gaussian process generates the functional relationship between the task variables and the parameters of this conditional. Varying-coefficient models subsume hierarchical Bayesian multitask models, but also generalizations in which the conditional varies continuously, for instance, in time or space. However, Bayesian inference in varying-coefficient models is generally intractable. We show that inference for varying-coefficient models with isotropic Gaussian process priors resolves to standard inference for a Gaussian process that can be solved efficiently. MAP inference in this model resolves to multitask learning using task and instance kernels, and inference for hierarchical Bayesian multitask models can be carried out efficiently using graph-Laplacian kernels. We report on experiments for geospatial prediction."
677,aaai,2021,Few-shot Learning for Multi-label Intent Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17541,"Zero-shot intent detection (ZSID) aims to deal with the continuously emerging intents without annotated training data. However, existing ZSID systems suffer from two limitations: 1) They are not good at modeling the relationship between seen and unseen intents. 2) They cannot effectively recognize unseen intents under the generalized intent detection (GZSID) setting. A critical problem behind these limitations is that the representations of unseen intents cannot be learned in the training stage. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that utilizes unseen class labels to learn Class-Transductive Intent Representations (CTIR). Specifically, we allow the model to predict unseen intents during training, with the corresponding label names serving as input utterances. On this basis, we introduce a multi-task learning objective, which encourages the model to learn the distinctions among intents, and a similarity scorer, which estimates the connections among intents more accurately. CTIR is easy to implement and can be integrated with existing methods. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that CTIR brings considerable improvement to the baseline systems."

In particular, for real-time generation tasks, different devices require generators of different sizes due to varying computing power. In this paper, we introduce slimmable GANs (SlimGANs), which can flexibly switch the width of the generator to accommodate various quality-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Specifically, we leverage multiple discriminators that share partial parameters to train the slimmable generator. To facilitate the \textit{consistency} between generators of different widths, we present a stepwise inplace distillation technique that encourages narrow generators to learn from wide ones. As for class-conditional generation, we propose a sliceable conditional batch normalization that incorporates the label information into different widths. Our methods are validated, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by extensive experiments and a detailed ablation study."
679,aaai,2021,Storage Fit Learning with Feature Evolvable Streams,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16944,"Feature evolvable learning has been widely studied in recent years where old features will vanish and new features will emerge when learning with streams. Conventional methods usually assume that a label will be revealed after prediction at each time step. However, in practice, this assumption may not hold whereas no label will be given at most time steps. A good solution is to leverage the technique of manifold regularization to utilize the previous similar data to assist the refinement of the online model. Nevertheless, this approach needs to store all previous data which is impossible in learning with streams that arrive sequentially in large volume. Thus we need a buffer to store part of them. Considering that different devices may have different storage budgets, the learning approaches should be flexible subject to the storage budget limit. In this paper, we propose a new setting: Storage-Fit Feature-Evolvable streaming Learning (SF$^2$EL) which incorporates the issue of rarely-provided labels into feature evolution. Our framework is able to fit its behavior to different storage budgets when learning with feature evolvable streams with unlabeled data. Besides, both theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach can preserve the merit of the original feature evolvable learning i.e., can always track the best baseline and thus perform well at any time step."
680,aaai,2021,Compound Word Transformer: Learning to Compose Full-Song Music over Dynamic Directed Hypergraphs,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16091,"To apply neural sequence models such as the Transformers to music generation tasks, one has to represent a piece of music by a sequence of tokens drawn from a finite set of pre-defined vocabulary. Such a vocabulary usually involves tokens of various types. For example, to describe a musical note, one needs separate tokens to indicate the note's pitch, duration, velocity (dynamics), and placement (onset time) along the time grid. While different types of tokens may possess different properties, existing models usually treat them equally, in the same way as modeling words in natural languages. In this paper, we present a conceptually different approach that explicitly takes into account the type of the tokens, such as note types and metric types. And, we propose a new Transformer decoder architecture that uses different feed-forward heads to model tokens of different types. With an expansion-compression trick, we convert a piece of music to a sequence of compound words by grouping neighboring tokens, greatly reducing the length of the token sequences. We show that the resulting model can be viewed as a learner over dynamic directed hypergraphs. And, we employ it to learn to compose expressive Pop piano music of full-song length (involving up to 10K individual tokens per song), both conditionally and unconditionally. Our experiment shows that, compared to state-of-the-art models, the proposed model converges 5--10 times faster at training (i.e., within a day on a single GPU with 11 GB memory), and with comparable quality in the generated music."
681,aaai,2021,DropLoss for Long-Tail Instance Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16246,"Long-tailed class distributions are prevalent among the practical applications of object detection and instance segmentation. Prior work in long-tail instance segmentation addresses the imbalance of losses between rare and frequent categories by reducing the penalty for a model incorrectly predicting a rare class label. We demonstrate that the rare categories are heavily suppressed by correct background predictions, which reduces the probability for all foreground categories with equal weight. Due to the relative infrequency of rare categories, this leads to an imbalance that biases towards predicting more frequent categories. Based on this insight, we develop DropLoss -- a novel adaptive loss to compensate for this imbalance without a trade-off between rare and frequent categories. With this loss, we show state-of-the-art mAP across rare, common, and frequent categories on the LVIS dataset."

However, it is challenging to develop a single-lead-based ECG interpretation model for multiple diseases diagnosis due to the lack of some key disease information. In this work, we propose inter-lead Multi-View Knowledge Transferring of ECG (MVKT-ECG) to boost single-lead ECG's ability for multi-label disease diagnosis. This training strategy can transfer superior disease knowledge from multiple different views of ECG (e.g. 12-lead ECG) to single-lead-based ECG interpretation model to mine details in single-lead ECG signals that are easily overlooked by neural networks. MVKT-ECG allows this lead variety as a supervision signal within a teacher-student paradigm, where the teacher observes multi-lead ECG educates a student who observes only single-lead ECG. Since the mutual disease information between the single-lead ECG and muli-lead ECG plays a key role in knowledge transferring, we present a new disease-aware Contrastive Lead-information Transferring(CLT) to improve the mutual disease information between the single-lead ECG and muli-lead ECG. Moreover, We modify traditional Knowledge Distillation to multi-label disease Knowledge Distillation (MKD) to make it applicable for multi-label disease diagnosis. The comprehensive experiments verify that MVKT-ECG has an excellent performance in improving the diagnostic effect of single-lead ECG."

Prior works have shown that using Computer Vision (CV) techniques to identify smoke as visual evidence can influence the attitude of regulators and empower citizens to pursue environmental justice. However, existing datasets are not of sufficient quality nor quantity to train the robust CV models needed to support air quality advocacy. We introduce RISE, the first large-scale video dataset for Recognizing Industrial Smoke Emissions. We adopted a citizen science approach to collaborate with local community members to annotate whether a video clip has smoke emissions. Our dataset contains 12,567 clips from 19 distinct views from cameras that monitored three industrial facilities. These daytime clips span 30 days over two years, including all four seasons. We ran experiments using deep neural networks to establish a strong performance baseline and reveal smoke recognition challenges. Our survey study discussed community feedback, and our data analysis displayed opportunities for integrating citizen scientists and crowd workers into the application of Artificial Intelligence for Social Impact."

Although existing methods heavily rely on an object detection model, we view the detection step as vocabulary retrieval from an external knowledge in the form of embeddings for any object's definition from Wiktionary, where we use in the retrieval image region features learned from a transformers model. We propose an end-to-end Novel Object Captioning with Retrieved vocabulary from External Knowledge method (NOC-REK), which simultaneously learns vocabulary retrieval and caption generation, successfully describing novel objects outside of the training dataset. Furthermore, our model eliminates the requirement for model retraining by simply updating the external knowledge whenever a novel object appears. Our comprehensive experiments on held-out COCO and Nocaps datasets show that our NOC-REK is considerably effective against SOTAs."

Recently, deep neural networks have proven to be very effective in pattern recognition, classification tasks and human-level control to model highly nonlinear realworld systems. This paper investigates the effectiveness of deep neural networks in the modeling of dynamical systems with complex behavior. Three deep neural network structures are trained on sequential data, and we investigate the effectiveness of these networks in modeling associated characteristics of the underlying dynamical systems. We carry out similar evaluations on select publicly available system identification datasets. We demonstrate that deep neural networks are effective model estimators from input-output data"

Previously, anomaly detection was mostly conducted using traditional shallow learning techniques, but with little improvement. As the emergence of graph neural networks (GNN), graph anomaly detection has been greatly developed. However, recent studies have shown that GNN-based methods encounter challenge, in that no graph anomaly detection algorithm can perform generalization on most datasets. To bridge the tap, we propose a multi-view fusion approach for graph anomaly detection (Mul-GAD). The view-level fusion captures the extent of significance between different views, while the feature-level fusion makes full use of complementary information. We theoretically and experimentally elaborate the effectiveness of the fusion strategies. For a more comprehensive conclusion, we further investigate the effect of the objective function and the number of fused views on detection performance. Exploiting these findings, our Mul-GAD is proposed equipped with fusion strategies and the well-performed objective function. Compared with other state-of-the-art detection methods, we achieve a better detection performance and generalization in most scenarios via a series of experiments conducted on Pubmed, Amazon Computer, Amazon Photo, Weibo and Books.

687,aaai,2021,Predictive Adversarial Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16953,"Most real-world knowledge graphs (KG) are far from complete and comprehensive. This problem has motivated efforts in predicting the most plausible missing facts to complete a given KG, i.e., knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, existing KGC methods suffer from two main issues, 1) the false negative issue, i.e., the sampled negative training instances may include potential true facts; and 2) the data sparsity issue, i.e., true facts account for only a tiny part of all possible facts. To this end, we propose positive-unlabeled learning with adversarial data augmentation (PUDA) for KGC. In particular, PUDA tailors positive-unlabeled risk estimator for the KGC task to deal with the false negative issue. Furthermore, to address the data sparsity issue, PUDA achieves a data augmentation strategy by unifying adversarial training and positive-unlabeled learning under the positive-unlabeled minimax game. Extensive experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of our proposed method."
688,aaai,2021,Stratified Rule-Aware Network for Abstract Visual Reasoning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16248,"Abstract reasoning refers to the ability to analyze information, discover rules at an intangible level, and solve problems in innovative ways. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test is typically used to examine the capability of abstract reasoning. The subject is asked to identify the correct choice from the answer set to fill the missing panel at the bottom right of RPM (e.g., a 3$\times$3 matrix), following the underlying rules inside the matrix. Recent studies, taking advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have achieved encouraging progress to accomplish the RPM test. However, they partly ignore necessary inductive biases of RPM solver, such as order sensitivity within each row/column and incremental rule induction. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a Stratified Rule-Aware Network (SRAN) to generate the rule embeddings for two input sequences. Our SRAN learns multiple granularity rule embeddings at different levels, and incrementally integrates the stratified embedding flows through a gated fusion module. With the help of embeddings, a rule similarity metric is applied to guarantee that SRAN can not only be trained using a tuplet loss but also infer the best answer efficiently. We further point out the severe defects existing in the popular RAVEN dataset for RPM test, which prevent from the fair evaluation of the abstract reasoning ability. To fix the defects, we propose an answer set generation algorithm called Attribute Bisection Tree (ABT), forming an improved dataset named Impartial-RAVEN (I-RAVEN for short). Extensive experiments are conducted on both PGM and I-RAVEN datasets, showing that our SRAN outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a considerable margin."
689,aaai,2021,Multidimensional Uncertainty-Aware Evidential Neural Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16954,"Evidential deep learning, built upon belief theory and subjective logic, offers a principled and computationally efficient way to turn a deterministic neural network uncertainty-aware. The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions. A deeper analysis of evidential activation functions based on our theoretical underpinning inspires the design of a novel regularizer that effectively alleviates this fundamental limitation. Extensive experiments over many challenging real-world datasets and settings confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."
690,aaai,2021,Continual Learning by Using Information of Each Class Holistically,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16952,"Modern machine learning systems need to be able to cope with constantly arriving and changing data. Two main areas of research dealing with such scenarios are continual learning and data stream mining. Continual learning focuses on accumulating knowledge and avoiding forgetting, assuming information once learned should be stored. Data stream mining focuses on adaptation to concept drift and discarding outdated information, assuming that only the most recent data is relevant. While these two areas are mainly being developed in separation, they offer complementary views on the problem of learning from dynamic data. There is a need for unifying them, by offering architectures capable of both learning and storing new information, as well as revisiting and adapting to changes in previously seen concepts. We propose a novel continual learning approach that can handle both tasks. Our experience replay method is fueled by a centroid-driven memory storing diverse instances of incrementally arriving classes. This is enhanced with a reactive subspace buffer that tracks concept drift occurrences in previously seen classes and adapts clusters accordingly. The proposed architecture is thus capable of both remembering valid and forgetting outdated information, offering a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift."
691,aaai,2021,A Generative Adversarial Framework for Bounding Confounded Causal Effects,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17437,"Confounding seriously impairs our ability to learn about causal relations from observational data. Confounding can be defined as a statistical association between two variables due to inputs from a common source (the confounder). For example, if $Z\rightarrow Y$ and $Z\rightarrow X$, then $X$ and $Y$ will be statistically dependent, even if there are no causal connections between the two. There are several approaches available to adjust for confounding, i.e. to remove, or reduce, the association between two variables due to the confounder. Common adjustment techniques include stratifying the analysis on the confounder, and including confounders as covariates in regression models. Most adjustments rely on the assumption that the causal effects of confounders, on different variables, do not co-vary. For example, if the causal effect of $Z$ on $X$ and the causal effect of $Z$ on $Y$ co-vary between observational units, a confounding effect remains after adjustment for $Z$. This causal-effect covariability and its consequences is the topic of this paper.   Causal-effect covariability is first explicated using the framework of structural causal models. Using this framework it is easy to show that causal-effect covariability generally leads to confounding that cannot be adjusted for by standard methods. Evidence from data indicates that the confounding introduced by causal-effect covariability might be a real concern in applied work."

Sign languages are visual languages, which require sign embeddings to capture the visual and linguistic semantics of sign. Unlike many common approaches to Sign Recognition, we focus on explicitly creating sign embeddings that bridge the gap between sign language and spoken language. We propose a learning framework to derive LCC (Learnt Contrastive Concept) embeddings for sign language, a weakly supervised contrastive approach to learning sign embeddings. We train a vocabulary of embeddings that are based on the linguistic labels for sign video. Additionally, we develop a conceptual similarity loss which is able to utilise word embeddings from NLP methods to create sign embeddings that have better sign language to spoken language correspondence. These learnt representations allow the model to automatically localise the sign in time. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art keypoint-based sign recognition performance on the WLASL and BOBSL datasets."

The artificially generated images by GANs are very realistic. The GANs have shown potential usability in several computer vision applications, including image generation, image-to-image translation, video synthesis, and others. Conventionally, the generator network is the backbone of GANs, which generates the samples and the discriminator network is used to facilitate the training of the generator network. The discriminator network is usually a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Whereas, the generator network is usually either an Up-CNN for image generation or an Encoder-Decoder network for image-to-image translation. The convolution-based networks exploit the local relationship in a layer, which requires the deep networks to extract the abstract features. Hence, CNNs suffer to exploit the global relationship in the feature space. However, recently developed Transformer networks are able to exploit the global relationship at every layer. The Transformer networks have shown tremendous performance improvement for several problems in computer vision. Motivated from the success of Transformer networks and GANs, recent works have tried to exploit the Transformers in GAN framework for the image/video synthesis. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the developments and advancements in GANs utilizing the Transformer networks for computer vision applications. The performance comparison for several applications on benchmark datasets is also performed and analyzed. The conducted survey will be very useful to deep learning and computer vision community to understand the research trends \& gaps related with Transformer-based GANs and to develop the advanced GAN architectures by exploiting the global and local relationships for different applications."
694,aaai,2021,Consistent Right-Invariant Fixed-Lag Smoother with Application to Visual Inertial SLAM,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16758,"State estimation problems without absolute position measurements routinely arise in navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous ground vehicles, etc., whose proper operation relies on accurate state estimates and reliable covariances. Unaware of absolute positions, these problems have immanent unobservable directions. Traditional causal estimators, however, usually gain spurious information on the unobservable directions, leading to over-confident covariance inconsistent with actual estimator errors. The consistency problem of fixed-lag smoothers (FLSs) has only been attacked by the first estimate Jacobian (FEJ) technique because of the complexity to analyze their observability property. But the FEJ has several drawbacks hampering its wide adoption. To ensure the consistency of a FLS, this paper introduces the right invariant error formulation into the FLS framework. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the observability of a FLS with the right invariant error. Our main contributions are twofold. As the first novelty, to bypass the complexity of analysis with the classic observability matrix, we show that observability analysis of FLSs can be done equivalently on the linearized system. Second, we prove that the inconsistency issue in the traditional FLS can be elegantly solved by the right invariant error formulation without artificially correcting Jacobians. By applying the proposed FLS to the monocular visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, we confirm that the method consistently estimates covariance similarly to a batch smoother in simulation and that our method achieved comparable accuracy as traditional FLSs on real data."

In this paper, we propose a Poisson Transfer Network (PTN) to mine the unlabeled information for SSFSL from two aspects. First, the Poisson Merriman Bence Osher (MBO) model builds a bridge for the communications between labeled and unlabeled examples. This model serves as a more stable and informative classifier than traditional graph-based SSFSL methods in the message-passing process of the labels. Second, the extra unlabeled samples are employed to transfer the knowledge from base classes to novel classes through contrastive learning. Specifically, we force the augmented positive pairs close while push the negative ones distant. Our contrastive transfer scheme implicitly learns the novel-class embeddings to alleviate the over-fitting problem on the few labeled data. Thus, we can mitigate the degeneration of embedding generality in novel classes. Extensive experiments indicate that PTN outperforms the state-of-the-art few-shot and SSFSL models on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmark datasets."

In a recent work (PNSE'2016), we gave equivalent syntax for a larger class of free choice nets obtained by dropping distributed choice property.   In both these works, the classes of free choice nets were restricted by a ""product condition"" on the set of final markings. In this paper we do away with this restriction and give expressions for the resultant classes of nets which correspond to ""free choice synchronous products and Zielonka automata"". For free choice nets with distributed choice property, we give an alternative characterization using properties checkable in polynomial time.   Free choice nets we consider are 1-bounded, S-coverable, and are labelled with distributed alphabets, where S-components of the associated S-cover respect the given alphabet distribution."

For example, a state-of-the-art syntactic dependency parser trained on Wall Street Journal sentences has an absolute drop in performance of more than ten points when tested on textual data from the Web. An efficient solution to make these methods more robust to domain shift is to first learn a word representation using large amounts of unlabeled data from both domains, and then use this representation as features in a supervised learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose to use hidden Markov models to learn word representations for part-of-speech tagging. In particular, we study the influence of using data from the source, the target or both domains to learn the representation and the different ways to represent words using an HMM."

A challenging issue of federated learning is data heterogeneity (i.e., data distributions may differ across clients). To cope with this issue, numerous federated learning methods aim at personalized federated learning and build optimized models for clients. Whereas existing studies empirically evaluated their own methods, the experimental settings (e.g., comparison methods, datasets, and client setting) in these studies differ from each other, and it is unclear which personalized federate learning method achieves the best performance and how much progress can be made by using these methods instead of standard (i.e., non-personalized) federated learning. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of existing personalized federated learning through comprehensive experiments to evaluate the characteristics of each method. Our experimental study shows that (1) there are no champion methods, (2) large data heterogeneity often leads to high accurate predictions, and (3) standard federated learning methods (e.g. FedAvg) with fine-tuning often outperform personalized federated learning methods. We open our benchmark tool FedBench for researchers to conduct experimental studies with various experimental settings."

These approaches employ cross-attention to bias the model towards specific contextual entities injected as bias-phrases to the model. Prior approaches typically relied on subword encoders for encoding the bias phrases. However, subword tokenizations are coarse and fail to capture granular pronunciation information which is crucial for biasing based on acoustic similarity. In this work, we propose to use lightweight character representations to encode fine-grained pronunciation features to improve contextual biasing guided by acoustic similarity between the audio and the contextual entities (termed acoustic biasing). We further integrate pretrained neural language model (NLM) based encoders to encode the utterance's semantic context along with contextual entities to perform biasing informed by the utterance's semantic context (termed semantic biasing). Experiments using a Conformer Transducer model on the Librispeech dataset show a 4.62% - 9.26% relative WER improvement on different biasing list sizes over the baseline contextual model when incorporating our proposed acoustic and semantic biasing approach. On a large-scale in-house dataset, we observe 7.91% relative WER improvement compared to our baseline model. On tail utterances, the improvements are even more pronounced with 36.80% and 23.40% relative WER improvements on Librispeech rare words and an in-house testset respectively."

While recent works retrieve supporting facts/evidence from commonsense knowledge bases to supply additional information to each question, there is still ample opportunity to advance it on the quality of the evidence. It is crucial since the quality of the evidence is the key to answering commonsense questions, and even determines the upper bound on the QA systems performance. In this paper, we propose a recursive erasure memory network (REM-Net) to cope with the quality improvement of evidence. To address this, REM-Net is equipped with a module to refine the evidence by recursively erasing the low-quality evidence that does not explain the question answering. Besides, instead of retrieving evidence from existing knowledge bases, REM-Net leverages a pre-trained generative model to generate candidate evidence customized for the question. We conduct experiments on two commonsense question answering datasets, WIQA and CosmosQA. The results demonstrate the performance of REM-Net and show that the refined evidence is explainable."
701,aaai,2021,HARGAN: Heterogeneous Argument Attention Network for Persuasiveness Prediction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17542,"Persuasion and argumentation are possibly among the most complex examples of the interplay between multiple human subjects. With the advent of the Internet, online forums provide wide platforms for people to share their opinions and reasonings around various diverse topics. In this work, we attempt to model persuasive interaction between users on Reddit, a popular online discussion forum. We propose a deep LSTM model to classify whether a conversation leads to a successful persuasion or not, and use this model to predict whether a certain chain of arguments can lead to persuasion. While learning persuasion dynamics, our model tends to identify argument facets implicitly, using an attention mechanism. We also propose a semi-supervised approach to extract argumentative components from discussion threads. Both these models provide useful insight into how people engage in argumentation on online discussion forums."
702,aaai,2021,Dialog Router: Automated Dialog Transition via Multi-Task Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.18005,"The task of dialog management is commonly decomposed into two sequential subtasks: dialog state tracking and dialog policy learning. In an end-to-end dialog system, the aim of dialog state tracking is to accurately estimate the true dialog state from noisy observations produced by the speech recognition and the natural language understanding modules. The state tracking task is primarily meant to support a dialog policy. From a probabilistic perspective, this is achieved by maintaining a posterior distribution over hidden dialog states composed of a set of context dependent variables. Once a dialog policy is learned, it strives to select an optimal dialog act given the estimated dialog state and a defined reward function. This paper introduces a novel method of dialog state tracking based on a bilinear algebric decomposition model that provides an efficient inference schema through collective matrix factorization. We evaluate the proposed approach on the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset and we show that the proposed tracker gives encouraging results compared to the state-of-the-art trackers that participated in this standard benchmark. Finally, we show that the prediction schema is computationally efficient in comparison to the previous approaches."
703,aaai,2021,Learning to Resolve Conflicts for Multi-Agent Path Finding with Conflict-Based Search,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17341,"Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for multi-agent path finding. At the high level, CBS repeatedly detects conflicts and resolves one of them by splitting the current problem into two subproblems. Previous work chooses the conflict to resolve by categorizing the conflict into three classes and always picking a conflict from the highest-priority class. In this work, we propose an oracle for conflict selection that results in smaller search tree sizes than the one used in previous work. However, the computation of the oracle is slow. Thus, we propose a machine-learning framework for conflict selection that observes the decisions made by the oracle and learns a conflict-selection strategy represented by a linear ranking function that imitates the oracle's decisions accurately and quickly. Experiments on benchmark maps indicate that our method significantly improves the success rates, the search tree sizes and runtimes over the current state-of-the-art CBS solver."
704,aaai,2021,Adversarial Defence by Diversified Simultaneous Training of Deep Ensembles,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16955,"Adversarial attacks have rendered high security risks on modern deep learning systems. Adversarial training can significantly enhance the robustness of neural network models by suppressing the non-robust features. However, the models often suffer from significant accuracy loss on clean data. Ensemble training methods have emerged as promising solutions for defending against adversarial attacks by diversifying the vulnerabilities among the sub-models, simultaneously maintaining comparable accuracy as standard training. However, existing ensemble methods are with poor scalability, owing to the rapid complexity increase when including more sub-models in the ensemble. Moreover, in real-world applications, it is difficult to deploy an ensemble with multiple sub-models, owing to the tight hardware resource budget and latency requirement. In this work, we propose ensemble-in-one (EIO), a simple but efficient way to train an ensemble within one random gated network (RGN). EIO augments the original model by replacing the parameterized layers with multi-path random gated blocks (RGBs) to construct a RGN. By diversifying the vulnerability of the numerous paths within the RGN, better robustness can be achieved. It provides high scalability because the paths within an EIO network exponentially increase with the network depth. Our experiments demonstrate that EIO consistently outperforms previous ensemble training methods with even less computational overhead."
705,aaai,2021,Text-Guided Graph Neural Networks for Referring 3D Instance Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16253,"This paper introduces a novel approach for 3D semantic instance segmentation on point clouds. A 3D convolutional neural network called submanifold sparse convolutional network is used to generate semantic predictions and instance embeddings simultaneously. To obtain discriminative embeddings for each 3D instance, a structure-aware loss function is proposed which considers both the structure information and the embedding information. To get more consistent embeddings for each 3D instance, attention-based k nearest neighbour (KNN) is proposed to assign different weights for different neighbours. Based on the attention-based KNN, we add a graph convolutional network after the sparse convolutional network to get refined embeddings. Our network can be trained end-to-end. A simple mean-shift algorithm is utilized to cluster refined embeddings to get final instance predictions. As a result, our framework can output both the semantic prediction and the instance prediction. Experiments show that our approach outperforms all state-of-art methods on ScanNet benchmark and NYUv2 dataset."

In this paper, for the first time, we show that with a well designed deep learning model, the hidden content may be largely recovered without opening the envelope. We start by modeling deep learning-based privacy attacks on physical mail content as learning the mapping from the camera-captured envelope front face image to the hidden content, then we explicitly model the mapping as a combination of perspective transformation, image dehazing and denoising using a deep convolutional neural network, named Neural-STE (See-Through-Envelope). We show experimentally that hidden content details, such as texture and image structure, can be clearly recovered. Finally, our formulation and model allow us to design envelopes that can counter deep learning-based privacy attacks on physical mail."
707,aaai,2021,Audio-Oriented Multimodal Machine Comprehension via Dynamic Inter- and Intra-modality Attention,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17548,"While Machine Comprehension (MC) has attracted extensive research interests in recent years, existing approaches mainly belong to the category of Machine Reading Comprehension task which mines textual inputs (paragraphs and questions) to predict the answers (choices or text spans). However, there are a lot of MC tasks that accept audio input in addition to the textual input, e.g. English listening comprehension test. In this paper, we target the problem of Audio-Oriented Multimodal Machine Comprehension, and its goal is to answer questions based on the given audio and textual information. To solve this problem, we propose a Dynamic Inter- and Intra-modality Attention (DIIA) model to effectively fuse the two modalities (audio and textual). DIIA can work as an independent component and thus be easily integrated into existing MC models. Moreover, we further develop a Multimodal Knowledge Distillation (MKD) module to enable our multimodal MC model to accurately predict the answers based only on either the text or the audio. As a result, the proposed approach can handle various tasks including: Audio-Oriented Multimodal Machine Comprehension, Machine Reading Comprehension and Machine Listening Comprehension, in a single model, making fair comparisons possible between our model and the existing unimodal MC models. Experimental results and analysis prove the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. First, the proposed DIIA boosts the baseline models by up to 21.08% in terms of accuracy; Second, under the unimodal scenarios, the MKD module allows our multimodal MC model to significantly outperform the unimodal models by up to 18.87%, which are trained and tested with only audio or textual data."

Classical estimators overlook the confounding effects and hence the estimation error can be magnificent. As such, we propose another approach to construct the estimators such that the error can be greatly reduced. The proposed estimators are shown to be unbiased, consistent, and robust through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical testing. Moreover, we compare the power of estimating the causal quantities between the classical estimators and the proposed estimators. The comparison is tested across a wide range of models, including linear regression models, tree-based models, and neural network-based models, under different simulated datasets that exhibit different levels of causality, different degrees of nonlinearity, and different distributional properties. Most importantly, we apply our approaches to a large observational dataset provided by a global technology firm that operates in both the e-commerce and the lending business. We find that the relative reduction of estimation error is strikingly substantial if the causal effects are accounted for correctly."

In this paper, we investigate the incomplete utterance restoration which has brought general improvement over multi-turn dialogue systems in recent studies. Meanwhile, jointly inspired by the autoregression for text generation and the sequence labeling for text editing, we propose a novel semi autoregressive generator (SARG) with the high efficiency and flexibility. Moreover, experiments on two benchmarks show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of quality and inference speed."
710,aaai,2021,Story Ending Generation with Multi-Level Graph Convolutional Networks over Dependency Trees,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17545,"Story ending generation is an interesting and challenging task, which aims to generate a coherent and reasonable ending given a story context. The key challenges of the task lie in how to comprehend the story context sufficiently and handle the implicit knowledge behind story clues effectively, which are still under-explored by previous work. In this paper, we propose a Story Heterogeneous Graph Network (SHGN) to explicitly model both the information of story context at different granularity levels and the multi-grained interactive relations among them. In detail, we consider commonsense knowledge, words and sentences as three types of nodes. To aggregate non-local information, a global node is also introduced. Given this heterogeneous graph network, the node representations are updated through graph propagation, which adequately utilizes commonsense knowledge to facilitate story comprehension. Moreover, we design two auxiliary tasks to implicitly capture the sentiment trend and key events lie in the context. The auxiliary tasks are jointly optimized with the primary story ending generation task in a multi-task learning strategy. Extensive experiments on the ROCStories Corpus show that the developed model achieves new state-of-the-art performances. Human study further demonstrates that our model generates more reasonable story endings."
711,aaai,2021,SDGNN: Learning Node Representation for Signed Directed Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16093,"Node representation learning for signed directed networks has received considerable attention in many real-world applications such as link sign prediction, node classification and node recommendation. The challenge lies in how to adequately encode the complex topological information of the networks. Recent studies mainly focus on preserving the first-order network topology which indicates the closeness relationships of nodes. However, these methods generally fail to capture the high-order topology which indicates the local structures of nodes and serves as an essential characteristic of the network topology. In addition, for the first-order topology, the additional value of non-existent links is largely ignored. In this paper, we propose to learn more representative node embeddings by simultaneously capturing the first-order and high-order topology in signed directed networks. In particular, we reformulate the representation learning problem on signed directed networks from a variational auto-encoding perspective and further develop a decoupled variational embedding (DVE) method. DVE leverages a specially designed auto-encoder structure to capture both the first-order and high-order topology of signed directed networks, and thus learns more representative node embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used real-world datasets. Comprehensive results on both link sign prediction and node recommendation task demonstrate the effectiveness of DVE. Qualitative results and analysis are also given to provide a better understanding of DVE."
712,aaai,2021,Modeling the Compatibility of Stem Tracks to Generate Music Mashups,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16092,"A music mashup combines audio elements from two or more songs to create a new work. To reduce the time and effort required to make them, researchers have developed algorithms that predict the compatibility of audio elements. Prior work has focused on mixing unaltered excerpts, but advances in source separation enable the creation of mashups from isolated stems (e.g., vocals, drums, bass, etc.). In this work, we take advantage of separated stems not just for creating mashups, but for training a model that predicts the mutual compatibility of groups of excerpts, using self-supervised and semi-supervised methods. Specifically, we first produce a random mashup creation pipeline that combines stem tracks obtained via source separation, with key and tempo automatically adjusted to match, since these are prerequisites for high-quality mashups. To train a model to predict compatibility, we use stem tracks obtained from the same song as positive examples, and random combinations of stems with key and/or tempo unadjusted as negative examples. To improve the model and use more data, we also train on ""average"" examples: random combinations with matching key and tempo, where we treat them as unlabeled data as their true compatibility is unknown. To determine whether the combined signal or the set of stem signals is more indicative of the quality of the result, we experiment on two model architectures and train them using semi-supervised learning technique. Finally, we conduct objective and subjective evaluations of the system, comparing them to a standard rule-based system."

Recent methods mix labels mainly based on the mixture proportion of image pixels. As the main discriminative information of a fine-grained image usually resides in subtle regions, methods along this line are prone to heavy label noise in fine-grained recognition. We propose in this paper a novel scheme, termed as Semantically Proportional Mixing (SnapMix), which exploits class activation map (CAM) to lessen the label noise in augmenting fine-grained data. SnapMix generates the target label for a mixed image by estimating its intrinsic semantic composition, and allows for asymmetric mixing operations and ensures semantic correspondence between synthetic images and target labels. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing mixed-based approaches on various datasets and under different network depths. Furthermore, by incorporating the mid-level features, the proposed SnapMix achieves top-level performance, demonstrating its potential to serve as a solid baseline for fine-grained recognition. Our code is available at https://github.com/Shaoli-Huang/SnapMix.git."

We introduce an extension of beam search inference based on word-level and n-gram level attention score to adjust and constrain Seq2Seq prediction at test time. Results show that our proposed solution can overcome the algorithm bias to shorter and nearly identical sequences, resulting in a significant improvement of the decoding performance on generating keyphrases that are present and absent in source text."

Since social network (user-user relations) and user-item interactions are both naturally represented as graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have thus been widely applied for social recommendation. In this work, we propose an end-to-end heterogeneous global graph learning framework, namely Graph Learning Augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GL-HGNN) for social recommendation. GL-HGNN aims to learn a heterogeneous global graph that makes full use of user-user relations, user-item interactions and item-item similarities in a unified perspective. To this end, we design a Graph Learner (GL) method to learn and optimize user-user and item-item connections separately. Moreover, we employ a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to capture the high-order complex semantic relations from our learned heterogeneous global graph. To scale up the computation of graph learning, we further present the Anchor-based Graph Learner (AGL) to reduce computational complexity. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."
716,aaai,2021,ACMo: Angle-Calibrated Moment Methods for Stochastic Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16959,"This paper presents a method to approximately solve stochastic optimal control problems in which the cost function and the system dynamics are polynomial. For stochastic systems with polynomial dynamics, the moments of the state can be expressed as a, possibly infinite, system of deterministic linear ordinary differential equations. By casting the problem as a deterministic control problem in moment space, semidefinite programming is used to find a lower bound on the optimal solution. The constraints in the semidefinite program are imposed by the ordinary differential equations for moment dynamics and semidefiniteness of the outer product of moments. From the solution to the semidefinite program, an approximate optimal control strategy can be constructed using a least squares method. In the linear quadratic case, the method gives an exact solution to the optimal control problem. In more complex problems, an infinite number of moment differential equations would be required to compute the optimal control law. In this case, we give a procedure to increase the size of the semidefinite program, leading to increasingly accurate approximations to the true optimal control strategy."
717,aaai,2021,Accelerating Continuous Normalizing Flow with Trajectory Polynomial Regularization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16956,"In this paper, we propose an approach to effectively accelerating the computation of continuous normalizing flow (CNF), which has been proven to be a powerful tool for the tasks such as variational inference and density estimation. The training time cost of CNF can be extremely high because the required number of function evaluations (NFE) for solving corresponding ordinary differential equations (ODE) is very large. We think that the high NFE results from large truncation errors of solving ODEs. To address the problem, we propose to add a regularization. The regularization penalizes the difference between the trajectory of the ODE and its fitted polynomial regression. The trajectory of ODE will approximate a polynomial function, and thus the truncation error will be smaller. Furthermore, we provide two proofs and claim that the additional regularization does not harm training quality. Experimental results show that our proposed method can result in 42.3% to 71.3% reduction of NFE on the task of density estimation, and 19.3% to 32.1% reduction of NFE on variational auto-encoder, while the testing losses are not affected."

When the model is inaccurate or biased, imaginary trajectories may be deleterious for training the action-value and policy functions. To alleviate such problem, this paper proposes to adaptively reweight the imaginary transitions, so as to reduce the negative effects of poorly generated trajectories. More specifically, we evaluate the effect of an imaginary transition by calculating the change of the loss computed on the real samples when we use the transition to train the action-value and policy functions. Based on this evaluation criterion, we construct the idea of reweighting each imaginary transition by a well-designed meta-gradient algorithm. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms on multiple tasks. Visualization of our changing weights further validates the necessity of utilizing reweight scheme."

The cutting-edge text recognition methods are based on attention mechanisms. However, most of attention methods usually suffer from serious alignment problem due to its recurrency alignment operation, where the alignment relies on historical decoding results. To remedy this issue, we propose a decoupled attention network (DAN), which decouples the alignment operation from using historical decoding results. DAN is an effective, flexible and robust end-to-end text recognizer, which consists of three components: 1) a feature encoder that extracts visual features from the input image; 2) a convolutional alignment module that performs the alignment operation based on visual features from the encoder; and 3) a decoupled text decoder that makes final prediction by jointly using the feature map and attention maps. Experimental results show that DAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text recognition tasks, including offline handwritten text recognition and regular/irregular scene text recognition."
720,aaai,2021,Initiative Defense against Facial Manipulation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16254,"Benefiting from the development of generative adversarial networks (GAN), facial manipulation has achieved significant progress in both academia and industry recently. It inspires an increasing number of entertainment applications but also incurs severe threats to individual privacy and even political security meanwhile. To mitigate such risks, many countermeasures have been proposed. However, the great majority methods are designed in a passive manner, which is to detect whether the facial images or videos are tampered after their wide propagation. These detection-based methods have a fatal limitation, that is, they only work for ex-post forensics but can not prevent the engendering of malicious behavior. To address the limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of initiative defense to degrade the performance of facial manipulation models controlled by malicious users. The basic idea is to actively inject imperceptible venom into target facial data before manipulation. To this end, we first imitate the target manipulation model with a surrogate model, and then devise a poison perturbation generator to obtain the desired venom. An alternating training strategy are further leveraged to train both the surrogate model and the perturbation generator. Two typical facial manipulation tasks: face attribute editing and face reenactment, are considered in our initiative defense framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework in different settings. Finally, we hope this work can shed some light on initiative countermeasures against more adversarial scenarios."

While methods for incorporating discourse become more and more sophisticated, the growing need for robust and general discourse structures has not been sufficiently met by current discourse parsers, usually trained on small scale datasets in a strictly limited number of domains. This makes the prediction for arbitrary tasks noisy and unreliable. The overall resulting lack of high-quality, high-quantity discourse trees poses a severe limitation to further progress. In order the alleviate this shortcoming, we propose a new strategy to generate tree structures in a task-agnostic, unsupervised fashion by extending a latent tree induction framework with an auto-encoding objective. The proposed approach can be applied to any tree-structured objective, such as syntactic parsing, discourse parsing and others. However, due to the especially difficult annotation process to generate discourse trees, we initially develop a method to generate larger and more diverse discourse treebanks. In this paper we are inferring general tree structures of natural text in multiple domains, showing promising results on a diverse set of tasks."

We, instead, explore the feasibility of Chinese semantic parsing in the absence of labeled data for Chinese meaning representations. We describe the pipeline of automatically collecting the linearized Chinese meaning representation data for sequential-to sequential neural networks. We further propose a test suite designed explicitly for Chinese semantic parsing, which provides fine-grained evaluation for parsing performance, where we aim to study Chinese parsing difficulties. Our experimental results show that the difficulty of Chinese semantic parsing is mainly caused by adverbs. Realizing Chinese parsing through machine translation and an English parser yields slightly lower performance than training a model directly on Chinese data."

In the paper, we propose a general meta ERL framework via bilevel optimization (BiERL) to jointly update hyperparameters in parallel to training the ERL model within a single agent, which relieves the need for prior domain knowledge or costly optimization procedure before model deployment. We design an elegant meta-level architecture that embeds the inner-level's evolving experience into an informative population representation and introduce a simple and feasible evaluation of the meta-level fitness function to facilitate learning efficiency. We perform extensive experiments in MuJoCo and Box2D tasks to verify that as a general framework, BiERL outperforms various baselines and consistently improves the learning performance for a diversity of ERL algorithms."

We develop novel index policies that we prove achieve order-optimality, and show that they achieve empirical performance competitive with the state-of-the-art benchmark methods in extensive experiments. The new policies achieve this with low computation time per pull for linear bandits, and thereby resulting in both favorable regret as well as computational efficiency."

However, the optimizer converges slowly at early epochs and there is a gap between large-batch deep learning optimization heuristics and theoretical underpinnings. In this paper, we propose a novel Complete Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (CLARS) algorithm for large-batch training. We also analyze the convergence rate of the proposed method by introducing a new fine-grained analysis of gradient-based methods. Based on our analysis, we bridge the gap and illustrate the theoretical insights for three popular large-batch training techniques, including linear learning rate scaling, gradual warmup, and layer-wise adaptive rate scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms gradual warmup technique by a large margin and defeats the convergence of the state-of-the-art large-batch optimizer in training advanced deep neural networks (ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet) on ImageNet dataset."

In this work, we investigate an alternative, from-machine-to-corpus-to-machine: general language models author these commonsense knowledge graphs to train commonsense models. Our study leads to a new framework, Symbolic Knowledge Distillation. As with prior art in Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), our approach uses larger models to teach smaller models. A key difference is that we distill knowledge symbolically-as text-in addition to the neural model. We also distill only one aspect-the commonsense of a general language model teacher, allowing the student to be a different type, a commonsense model. Altogether, we show that careful prompt engineering and a separately trained critic model allow us to selectively distill high-quality causal commonsense from GPT-3, a general language model. Empirical results demonstrate that, for the first time, a human-authored commonsense knowledge graph is surpassed by our automatically distilled variant in all three criteria: quantity, quality, and diversity. In addition, it results in a neural commonsense model that surpasses the teacher model's commonsense capabilities despite its 100x smaller size. We apply this to the ATOMIC resource, and share our new symbolic knowledge graph and commonsense models."
727,aaai,2021,Computing the Proportional Veto Core,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16691,"In social choice there often arises a conflict between the majority principle (the search for a candidate that is as good as possible for as many voters as possible), and the protection of minority rights (choosing a candidate that is not overly bad for particular individuals or groups). In a context where the latter is our main concern, veto-based rules -- giving individuals or groups the ability to strike off certain candidates from the list -- are a natural and effective way of ensuring that no minority is left with an outcome they find untenable. However, such rules often fail to be anonymous, or impose specific restrictions on the number of voters and candidates. These issues can be addressed by considering the proportional veto core -- the solution to a cooperative game where every coalition is given the power to veto a number of candidates proportional to its size. However, the na\""ive algorithm for the veto core is exponential, and the only known rule for selecting from the core, with an arbitrary number of voters, fails anonymity. In this paper we present a polynomial time algorithm for computing the core, study its expected size, and present an anonymous rule for selecting a candidate from it. We study the properties of core-consistent voting rules. Finally, we show that a pessimist can manipulate the core in polynomial time, while an optimist cannot manipulate it at all."
728,aaai,2021,Anomaly Attribution with Likelihood Compensation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16535,"When the prediction of a black-box machine learning model deviates from the true observation, what can be said about the reason behind that deviation? This is a fundamental and ubiquitous question that the end user in a business or industrial AI application often asks. The deviation may be due to a sub-optimal black-box model, or it may be simply because the sample in question is an outlier. In either case, one would ideally wish to obtain some form of attribution score -- a value indicative of the extent to which an input variable is responsible for the anomaly.   In the present paper we address this task of ``anomaly attribution,'' particularly in the setting in which the model is black-box and the training data are not available. Specifically, we propose a novel likelihood-based attribution framework we call the ``likelihood compensation (LC),'' in which the responsibility score is equated with the correction on each input variable needed to attain the highest possible likelihood. We begin by showing formally why mainstream model-agnostic explanation methods, such as the local linear surrogate modeling and Shapley values, are not designed to explain anomalies. In particular, we show that they are ``deviation-agnostic,'' namely, that their explanations are blind to the fact that there is a deviation in the model prediction for the sample of interest. We do this by positioning these existing methods under the unified umbrella of a function family we call the ``integrated gradient family.'' We validate the effectiveness of the proposed LC approach using publicly available data sets. We also conduct a case study with a real-world building energy prediction task and confirm its usefulness in practice based on expert feedback."
729,aaai,2021,A Scalable Two Stage Approach to Computing Optimal Decision Sets,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16498,"Machine learning (ML) is ubiquitous in modern life. Since it is being deployed in technologies that affect our privacy and safety, it is often crucial to understand the reasoning behind its decisions, warranting the need for explainable AI. Rule-based models, such as decision trees, decision lists, and decision sets, are conventionally deemed to be the most interpretable. Recent work uses propositional satisfiability (SAT) solving (and its optimization variants) to generate minimum-size decision sets. Motivated by limited practical scalability of these earlier methods, this paper proposes a novel approach to learn minimum-size decision sets by enumerating individual rules of the target decision set independently of each other, and then solving a set cover problem to select a subset of rules. The approach makes use of modern maximum satisfiability and integer linear programming technologies. Experiments on a wide range of publicly available datasets demonstrate the advantage of the new approach over the state of the art in SAT-based decision set learning."
730,aaai,2021,The Price of Anarchy in ROSCAS with Risk Averse Agents,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17978,"We study the price of anarchy of mechanisms in the presence of risk-averse agents. Previous work has focused on agents with quasilinear utilities, possibly with a budget. Our model subsumes this as a special case but also captures that agents might be less sensitive to payments than in the risk-neutral model. We show that many positive price-of-anarchy results proved in the smoothness framework continue to hold in the more general risk-averse setting. A sufficient condition is that agents can never end up with negative quasilinear utility after playing an undominated strategy. This is true, e.g., for first-price and second-price auctions. For all-pay auctions, similar results do not hold: We show that there are Bayes-Nash equilibria with arbitrarily bad social welfare compared to the optimum."

However, since the financial market has a highly non-stationary nature hindering the application of typical data-hungry machine learning methods, leveraging financial inductive biases is important to ensure better sample efficiency and robustness. In this study, we propose a novel method of constructing a portfolio based on predicting the distribution of a financial quantity called residual factors, which is known to be generally useful for hedging the risk exposure to common market factors. The key technical ingredients are twofold. First, we introduce a computationally efficient extraction method for the residual information, which can be easily combined with various prediction algorithms. Second, we propose a novel neural network architecture that allows us to incorporate widely acknowledged financial inductive biases such as amplitude invariance and time-scale invariance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on U.S. and Japanese stock market data. Through ablation experiments, we also verify that each individual technique contributes to improving the performance of trading strategies. We anticipate our techniques may have wide applications in various financial problems."

733,aaai,2021,A Hybrid Attention Mechanism for Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16256,"Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging vision task due to the absence of ground-truth temporal locations of actions in the training videos. With only video-level supervision during training, most existing methods rely on a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework to predict the start and end frame of each action category in a video. However, the existing MIL-based approach has a major limitation of only capturing the most discriminative frames of an action, ignoring the full extent of an activity. Moreover, these methods cannot model background activity effectively, which plays an important role in localizing foreground activities. In this paper, we present a novel framework named HAM-Net with a hybrid attention mechanism which includes temporal soft, semi-soft and hard attentions to address these issues. Our temporal soft attention module, guided by an auxiliary background class in the classification module, models the background activity by introducing an ""action-ness"" score for each video snippet. Moreover, our temporal semi-soft and hard attention modules, calculating two attention scores for each video snippet, help to focus on the less discriminative frames of an action to capture the full action boundary. Our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by at least 2.2% mAP at IoU threshold 0.5 on the THUMOS14 dataset, and by at least 1.3% mAP at IoU threshold 0.75 on the ActivityNet1.2 dataset.

The addition of color substantially enhances the overall expressivity of a sketch. This paper proposes two methods to mimic human-drawn colored sketches by utilizing the Contour Drawing Dataset. Our first approach renders colored outline sketches by applying image processing techniques aided by k-means color clustering. The second method uses a generative adversarial network to develop a model that can generate colored sketches from previously unobserved images.

However, these perception maps are not perfect and result in state estimation errors that can lead to unsafe system behavior. Stochastic sensor noise can make matters worse and result in estimation errors that follow unknown distributions. We propose a perception-based control framework that i) quantifies estimation uncertainty of perception maps, and ii) integrates these uncertainty representations into the control design. To do so, we use conformal prediction to compute valid state estimation regions, which are sets that contain the unknown state with high probability. We then devise a sampled-data controller for continuous-time systems based on the notion of measurement robust control barrier functions. Our controller uses idea from self-triggered control and enables us to avoid using stochastic calculus. Our framework is agnostic to the choice of the perception map, independent of the noise distribution, and to the best of our knowledge the first to provide probabilistic safety guarantees in such a setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed perception-based controller for a LiDAR-enabled F1/10th car."

The reconstructed adjacency matrix can reduce the effects of adversarial perturbations and boost the performance of GCNs when facing adversarial attacks.

Individual Fairness suggests that similar individuals with respect to a certain task are to be treated similarly by the decision model. In this work, we have two main objectives. The first is to construct a verifier which checks whether the fairness property holds for a given NN in a classification task or provide a counterexample if it is violated, i.e., the model is fair if all similar individuals are classified the same, and unfair if a pair of similar individuals are classified differently. To that end, We construct a sound and complete verifier that verifies global individual fairness properties of ReLU NN classifiers using distance-based similarity metrics. The second objective of this paper is to provide a method for training provably fair NN classifiers from unfair (biased) data. We propose a fairness loss that can be used during training to enforce fair outcomes for similar individuals. We then provide provable bounds on the fairness of the resulting NN. We run experiments on commonly used fairness datasets that are publicly available and we show that global individual fairness can be improved by 96 % without significant drop in test accuracy."

However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a ""sweet spot"" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks in general."
740,aaai,2021,Neural Utility Functions,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16966,"It is typically understood that the training of modern neural networks is a process of fitting the probability distribution of desired output. However, recent paradoxical observations in a number of language generation tasks let one wonder if this canonical probability-based explanation can really account for the empirical success of deep learning. To resolve this issue, we propose an alternative utility-based explanation to the standard supervised learning procedure in deep learning. The basic idea is to interpret the learned neural network not as a probability model but as an ordinal utility function that encodes the preference revealed in training data. In this perspective, training of the neural network corresponds to a utility learning process. Specifically, we show that for all neural networks with softmax outputs, the SGD learning dynamic of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be seen as an iteration process that optimizes the neural network toward an optimal utility function. This utility-based interpretation can explain several otherwise-paradoxical observations about the neural networks thus trained. Moreover, our utility-based theory also entails an equation that can transform the learned utility values back to a new kind of probability estimation with which probability-compatible decision rules enjoy dramatic (double-digits) performance improvements. These evidences collectively reveal a phenomenon of utility-probability duality in terms of what modern neural networks are (truly) modeling: We thought they are one thing (probabilities), until the unexplainable showed up; changing mindset and treating them as another thing (utility values) largely reconcile the theory, despite remaining subtleties regarding its original (probabilistic) identity."

These data usually consist of time series which subsample a continuous-time biophysiological process. While it is well-known that subsampling can lead to imputation of spurious causal connections where none exist, here we address the equally important issue of the effects of subsampling on the ability to reliably detect causal connections which do exist.   Neurophysiological processes typically feature signal propagation delays on multiple time scales; accordingly, we base our analysis on a distributed-lag, continuous-time stochastic model, and consider Granger causality in continuous time at finite prediction horizons. Via exact analytical solutions, we identify relationships among sampling frequency, underlying causal time scales and detectability of causalities. Our analysis reveals complex interactions between the time scale(s) of neural signal propagation and sampling frequency: we demonstrate that Granger causality decays exponentially as the sample time interval increases beyond causal delay times, identify detectability ""black spots"" and ""sweet spots"", and show that subsampling may sometimes improve detectability. We also demonstrate that the invariance of Granger causality under causal, invertible filtering fails at finite prediction horizons. We discuss the implications of our results for inference of Granger causality at the neural level from various neurophysiological recording modes, and emphasise that sampling rates for causal analysis of neurophysiological time series should be informed by domain-specific time scales."

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide an expressive way to fuse information from network structure and node features. However, GNNs are prone to adversarial attacks. Here we introduce Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB), an information-theoretic principle that optimally balances expressiveness and robustness of the learned representation of graph-structured data. Inheriting from the general Information Bottleneck (IB), GIB aims to learn the minimal sufficient representation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information between the representation and the target, and simultaneously constraining the mutual information between the representation and the input data. Different from the general IB, GIB regularizes the structural as well as the feature information. We design two sampling algorithms for structural regularization and instantiate the GIB principle with two new models: GIB-Cat and GIB-Bern, and demonstrate the benefits by evaluating the resilience to adversarial attacks. We show that our proposed models are more robust than state-of-the-art graph defense models. GIB-based models empirically achieve up to 31% improvement with adversarial perturbation of the graph structure as well as node features."

Most studies manually tie intermediate features of the teacher and student, and transfer knowledge through pre-defined links. However, manual selection often constructs ineffective links that limit the improvement from the distillation. There has been an attempt to address the problem, but it is still challenging to identify effective links under practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an effective and efficient feature distillation method utilizing all the feature levels of the teacher without manually selecting the links. Specifically, our method utilizes an attention-based meta-network that learns relative similarities between features, and applies identified similarities to control distillation intensities of all possible pairs. As a result, our method determines competent links more efficiently than the previous approach and provides better performance on model compression and transfer learning tasks. Further qualitative analyses and ablative studies describe how our method contributes to better distillation.

However, such vectorial representations only contain region-level information without considering the global information reflecting the entire image, which fails to expand the capability of complex multi-modal reasoning in image captioning. In this paper, we introduce a Global Enhanced Transformer (termed GET) to enable the extraction of a more comprehensive global representation, and then adaptively guide the decoder to generate high-quality captions. In GET, a Global Enhanced Encoder is designed for the embedding of the global feature, and a Global Adaptive Decoder are designed for the guidance of the caption generation. The former models intra- and inter-layer global representation by taking advantage of the proposed Global Enhanced Attention and a layer-wise fusion module. The latter contains a Global Adaptive Controller that can adaptively fuse the global information into the decoder to guide the caption generation. Extensive experiments on MS COCO dataset demonstrate the superiority of our GET over many state-of-the-arts."

In many such situations there is a critical need to both reliably assess the performance of these pre-trained models and to perform this assessment in a label-efficient manner (given that labels may be scarce and costly to collect). In this paper, we introduce an active Bayesian approach for assessment of classifier performance to satisfy the desiderata of both reliability and label-efficiency. We begin by developing inference strategies to quantify uncertainty for common assessment metrics such as accuracy, misclassification cost, and calibration error. We then propose a general framework for active Bayesian assessment using inferred uncertainty to guide efficient selection of instances for labeling, enabling better performance assessment with fewer labels. We demonstrate significant gains from our proposed active Bayesian approach via a series of systematic empirical experiments assessing the performance of modern neural classifiers (e.g., ResNet and BERT) on several standard image and text classification datasets."

Conventional methods for forecasting these forward citations cast the problem as analysis of temporal point processes which rely on the conditional intensity of previously received citations. Recent approaches model the conditional intensity as a chain of recurrent neural networks to capture memory dependency in hopes of reducing the restrictions of the parametric form of the intensity function. For the problem of patent citations, we observe that forecasting a patent's chain of citations benefits from not only the patent's history itself but also from the historical citations of assignees and inventors associated with that patent. In this paper, we propose a sequence-to-sequence model which employs an attention-of-attention mechanism to capture the dependencies of these multiple time sequences. Furthermore, the proposed model is able to forecast both the timestamp and the category of a patent's next citation. Extensive experiments on a large patent citation dataset collected from USPTO demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models at forward citation forecasting."

However, these methods always fail in real-world scene, since the Low-Resolution (LR) images after the ideal degradation (e.g., bicubic down-sampling) deviate from real source domain. The domain gap between the LR images and the real-world images can be observed clearly on frequency density, which inspires us to explictly narrow the undesired gap caused by incorrect degradation. From this point of view, we design a novel Frequency Consistent Adaptation (FCA) that ensures the frequency domain consistency when applying existing SR methods to the real scene. We estimate degradation kernels from unsupervised images and generate the corresponding LR images. To provide useful gradient information for kernel estimation, we propose Frequency Density Comparator (FDC) by distinguishing the frequency density of images on different scales. Based on the domain-consistent LR-HR pairs, we train easy-implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) SR models. Extensive experiments show that the proposed FCA improves the performance of the SR model under real-world setting achieving state-of-the-art results with high fidelity and plausible perception, thus providing a novel effective framework for real-world SR application."

However, recent studies reported that such graph convolutional node classifier can be deceived by adversarial perturbations on graphs. Abusing graph convolutions, a node's classification result can be influenced by poisoning its neighbors. Given an attributed graph and a node classifier, how can we evaluate robustness against such indirect adversarial attacks? Can we generate strong adversarial perturbations which are effective on not only one-hop neighbors, but more far from the target? In this paper, we demonstrate that the node classifier can be deceived with high-confidence by poisoning just a single node even two-hops or more far from the target. Towards achieving the attack, we propose a new approach which searches smaller perturbations on just a single node far from the target. In our experiments, our proposed method shows 99% attack success rate within two-hops from the target in two datasets. We also demonstrate that m-layer graph convolutional neural networks have chance to be deceived by our indirect attack within m-hop neighbors. The proposed attack can be used as a benchmark in future defense attempts to develop graph convolutional neural networks with having adversary robustness."

In response, YouTube creators participated in the #StayHome #WithMe movement (SHWM) and made myriad videos for people experiencing loneliness or boredom at home. User-shared videos generate parasocial attachment and virtual connectedness. However, there is limited knowledge of how creators contributed videos during disasters to provide social provisions as disaster-relief. Grounded on Weiss's loneliness theory, this work analyzed 1488 SHWM videos to examine video sharing as a pathway to social provisions. Findings suggested that skill and knowledge sharing, entertaining arts, homelife activities, live chatting, and gameplay were the most popular video styles. YouTubers utilized parasocial relationships to form a space for staying away from the disaster. SHWM YouTubers provided friend-like, mentor-like, and family-like provisions through videos in different styles. Family-like provisions led to the highest overall viewer engagement.

However, the robustness of heuristic defenses is hard to measure. Random selection based defenses can achieve certified robustness by averaging the classifiers' predictions on the sub-datasets sampled from the training set. This paper proposes a framework of random selection based certified defenses against data poisoning attacks. Specifically, we prove that the random selection schemes that satisfy certain conditions are robust against data poisoning attacks. We also derive the analytical form of the certified radius for the qualified random selection schemes. The certified radius of bagging derived by our framework is tighter than the previous work. Our framework allows users to improve robustness by leveraging prior knowledge about the training set and the poisoning model. Given higher level of prior knowledge, we can achieve higher certified accuracy both theoretically and practically. According to the experiments on three benchmark datasets: MNIST 1/7, MNIST, and CIFAR-10, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art."

Unsupervised approaches have been studied to summarize texts without human-written summaries. However, recent unsupervised models are extractive, which remove words from texts and thus they are less flexible than abstractive summarization. In this work, we devise an abstractive model based on reinforcement learning without ground-truth summaries. We formulate the unsupervised summarization based on the Markov decision process with rewards representing the summary quality. To further enhance the summary quality, we develop a multi-summary learning mechanism that generates multiple summaries with varying lengths for a given text, while making the summaries mutually enhance each other. Experimental results show that the proposed model substantially outperforms both abstractive and extractive models, yet frequently generating new words not contained in input texts."

Most existing methods tackle this challenge by aligning spatial features of body parts according to external semantic cues or feature similarities but this alignment approach is complicated and sensitive to noises. We design DRL-Net, a disentangled representation learning network that handles occluded re-ID without requiring strict person image alignment or any additional supervision. Leveraging transformer architectures, DRL-Net achieves alignment-free re-ID via global reasoning of local features of occluded person images. It measures image similarity by automatically disentangling the representation of undefined semantic components, e.g., human body parts or obstacles, under the guidance of semantic preference object queries in the transformer. In addition, we design a decorrelation constraint in the transformer decoder and impose it over object queries for better focus on different semantic components. To better eliminate interference from occlusions, we design a contrast feature learning technique (CFL) for better separation of occlusion features and discriminative ID features. Extensive experiments over occluded and holistic re-ID benchmarks (Occluded-DukeMTMC, Market1501 and DukeMTMC) show that the DRL-Net achieves superior re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins for Occluded-DukeMTMC."

We crawled movie scripts from IMSDb, and annotated the relation labels for each session according to 13 pre-defined relationships. The annotated dataset DDRel consists of 6300 dyadic dialogue sessions between 694 pair of speakers with 53,126 utterances in total. We also construct session-level and pair-level relation classification tasks with widely-accepted baselines.

The existing clustering ensemble methods generally construct a co-association matrix, which indicates the pairwise similarity between samples, as the weighted linear combination of the connective matrices from different base clusterings, and the resulting co-association matrix is then adopted as the input of an off-the-shelf clustering algorithm, e.g., spectral clustering. However, the co-association matrix may be dominated by poor base clusterings, resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank tensor approximation-based method to solve the problem from a global perspective. Specifically, by inspecting whether two samples are clustered to an identical cluster under different base clusterings, we derive a coherent-link matrix, which contains limited but highly reliable relationships between samples. We then stack the coherent-link matrix and the co-association matrix to form a three-dimensional tensor, the low-rankness property of which is further explored to propagate the information of the coherent-link matrix to the co-association matrix, producing a refined co-association matrix. We formulate the proposed method as a convex constrained optimization problem and solve it efficiently. Experimental results over 7 benchmark data sets show that the proposed model achieves a breakthrough in clustering performance, compared with 12 state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the potential of low-rank tensor on clustering ensemble, which is fundamentally different from previous approaches."

We observe that object candidates mined through current multiple instance learning methods are usually trapped to discriminative object parts, rather than the entire object. TS2C leverages surrounding segmentation context derived from weakly-supervised segmentation to suppress such low-quality distracting candidates and boost the high-quality ones. Specifically, TS2C is developed based on two key properties of desirable bounding boxes: 1) high purity, meaning most pixels in the box are with high object response, and 2) high completeness, meaning the box covers high object response pixels comprehensively. With such novel and computable criteria, more tight candidates can be discovered for learning a better object detector. With TS2C, we obtain 48.0% and 44.4% mAP scores on VOC 2007 and 2012 benchmarks, which are the new state-of-the-arts."

As usual, learning an optimal policy in this setting typically requires a large amount of training experiences. Reward shaping is a common approach for incorporating domain knowledge into reinforcement learning in order to speed up convergence to an optimal policy. However, to the best of our knowledge, the theoretical properties of reward shaping have thus far only been established in the discounted setting. This paper presents the first reward shaping framework for average-reward learning and proves that, under standard assumptions, the optimal policy under the original reward function can be recovered. In order to avoid the need for manual construction of the shaping function, we introduce a method for utilizing domain knowledge expressed as a temporal logic formula. The formula is automatically translated to a shaping function that provides additional reward throughout the learning process. We evaluate the proposed method on three continuing tasks.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, public health officials asked the public to practice social distancing to reduce the number of physical contacts. However, quantifying social distancing is a challenging task and current methods are based on human movements. We propose a time and cost-effective approach to measure how people practice social distancing. This study proposes a new method based on utilizing the frequency of hashtags supporting and encouraging social distancing for measuring social distancing. We have identified 18 related hashtags and tracked their trends between Jan and May 2020. Our evaluation results show that there is a strong correlation (P<0.05) between our findings and the Google social distancing report."

However, few studies have provided flexible solutions to identifying a person in an image containing arbitrary part of the body. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate matching method to address this problem. The proposed method leverages Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to generate fix-sized spatial feature maps such that pixel-level features are consistent. To match a pair of person images of different sizes, a novel method called Deep Spatial feature Reconstruction (DSR) is further developed to avoid explicit alignment. Specifically, DSR exploits the reconstructing error from popular dictionary learning models to calculate the similarity between different spatial feature maps. In that way, we expect that the proposed FCN can decrease the similarity of coupled images from different persons and increase that from the same person. Experimental results on two partial person datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with several state-of-the-art partial person re-id approaches. Additionally, DSR achieves competitive results on a benchmark person dataset Market1501 with 83.58\% Rank-1 accuracy."

More specifically, we develop a framework in which a human and an autonomy protocol can issue commands to carry out a certain task. We blend these commands into a joint input to a robot. We model the interaction between the human and the robot as a Markov decision process (MDP) that represents the shared control scenario. Using inverse reinforcement learning, we obtain an abstraction of the human's behavior and decisions. We use randomized strategies to account for randomness in human's decisions, caused by factors such as complexity of the task specifications or imperfect interfaces. We design the autonomy protocol to ensure that the resulting robot behavior satisfies given safety and performance specifications in probabilistic temporal logic. Additionally, the resulting strategies generate behavior as similar to the behavior induced by the human's commands as possible. We solve the underlying problem efficiently using quasiconvex programming. Case studies involving autonomous wheelchair navigation and unmanned aerial vehicle mission planning showcase the applicability of our approach."

In this paper, we propose a convolutional architecture InceptionXML which is light-weight, yet powerful, and robust to the inherent lack of word-order in short-text queries encountered in search and recommendation tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of applying convolutions by recasting the operation along the embedding dimension instead of the word dimension as applied in conventional CNNs for text classification. Towards scaling our model to datasets with millions of labels, we also propose InceptionXML+ framework which improves upon the shortcomings of the recently proposed dynamic hard-negative mining technique for label shortlisting by synchronizing the label-shortlister and extreme classifier. InceptionXML+ not only reduces the inference time to half but is also an order of magnitude smaller than previous state-of-the-art Astec in terms of model size. Through our proposed models, we outperform all existing approaches on popular benchmark datasets."

However, the Batch Normalization works best using large batch size during training and as the state-of-the-art segmentation convolutional neural network architectures are very memory demanding, large batch size is often impossible to achieve on current hardware. We evaluate the alternative normalization methods proposed to solve this issue on a problem of binary spine segmentation from 3D CT scan. Our results show the effectiveness of Instance Normalization in the limited batch size neural network training environment. Out of all the compared methods the Instance Normalization achieved the highest result with Dice coefficient = 0.96 which is comparable to our previous results achieved by deeper network with longer training time. We also show that the Instance Normalization implementation used in this experiment is computational time efficient when compared to the network without any normalization method."

Geometric motion segmentation algorithms, however, generalize to novel scenes, but have yet to achieve comparable performance to appearance-based ones, due to noisy motion estimations and degenerate motion configurations. To combine the best of both worlds, we propose a modular network, whose architecture is motivated by a geometric analysis of what independent object motions can be recovered from an egomotion field. It takes two consecutive frames as input and predicts segmentation masks for the background and multiple rigidly moving objects, which are then parameterized by 3D rigid transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for rigid motion segmentation on KITTI and Sintel. The inferred rigid motions lead to a significant improvement for depth and scene flow estimation. At the time of submission, our method ranked 1st on KITTI scene flow leaderboard, out-performing the best published method (scene flow error: 4.89% vs 6.31%)."

However, actual probability distribution statistics hidden in the latent space are not discovered by exploiting the reconstruction error because the probability distribution of anomalies is not explicitly modeled. To address the issue, we propose a novel probability distribution representation detector (PDRD) that explores the intrinsic distribution of both the background and the anomalies in original data for hyperspectral anomaly detection in this paper. First, we represent the hyperspectral data with multivariate Gaussian distributions from a probabilistic perspective. Then, we combine the local statistics with the obtained distributions to leverage the spatial information. Finally, the difference between the corresponding distributions of the test pixel and the average expectation of the pixels in the Chebyshev neighborhood is measured by computing the modified Wasserstein distance to acquire the detection map. We conduct the experiments on four real data sets to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art detection methods."
766,aaai,2021,Action Candidate Based Clipped Double Q-learning for Discrete and Continuous Action Tasks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16973,"Double Q-learning is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm in Markov decision process (MDP) problems. Clipped Double Q-learning, as an effective variant of Double Q-learning, employs the clipped double estimator to approximate the maximum expected action value. Due to the underestimation bias of the clipped double estimator, performance of clipped Double Q-learning may be degraded in some stochastic environments. In this paper, in order to reduce the underestimation bias, we propose an action candidate based clipped double estimator for Double Q-learning. Specifically, we first select a set of elite action candidates with the high action values from one set of estimators. Then, among these candidates, we choose the highest valued action from the other set of estimators. Finally, we use the maximum value in the second set of estimators to clip the action value of the chosen action in the first set of estimators and the clipped value is used for approximating the maximum expected action value. Theoretically, the underestimation bias in our clipped Double Q-learning decays monotonically as the number of the action candidates decreases. Moreover, the number of action candidates controls the trade-off between the overestimation and underestimation biases. In addition, we also extend our clipped Double Q-learning to continuous action tasks via approximating the elite continuous action candidates. We empirically verify that our algorithm can more accurately estimate the maximum expected action value on some toy environments and yield good performance on several benchmark problems."

Automated analysis of the drawing process has been studied as a promising means for screening prodromal and clinical dementia, providing multifaceted information encompassing features, such as drawing speed, pen posture, writing pressure, and pauses. We examined the feasibility of using these features not only for detecting prodromal and clinical dementia but also for predicting the severity of cognitive impairments assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as well as the severity of neuropathological changes assessed by medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. We collected drawing data with a digitizing tablet and pen from 145 older adults of cognitively normal (CN), MCI, and dementia. The nested cross-validation results indicate that the combination of drawing features could be used to classify CN, MCI, and dementia with an AUC of 0.909 and 75.1% accuracy (CN vs. MCI: 82.4% accuracy; CN vs. dementia: 92.2% accuracy; MCI vs. dementia: 80.3% accuracy) and predict MMSE scores with an $R^2$ of 0.491 and severity of MTL atrophy with an $R^2$ of 0.293. Our findings suggest that automated analysis of the drawing process can provide information about cognitive impairments and neuropathological changes due to dementia, which can help identify prodromal and clinical dementia as a digital biomarker."

Though their work and the recent work (Li et al.2020) have proposed some basic approaches for mapping the sampling-based metrics to their global counterparts which rank the entire set of items, there is still a lack of understanding and consensus on how sampling should be used for recommendation evaluation. The proposed approaches either are rather uninformative (linking sampling to metric evaluation) or can only work on simple metrics, such as Recall/Precision (Krichene and Rendle 2020; Li et al. 2020). In this paper, we introduce a new research problem on learning the empirical rank distribution, and a new approach based on the estimated rank distribution, to estimate the top-k metrics. Since this question is closely related to the underlying mechanism of sampling for recommendation, tackling it can help better understand the power of sampling and can help resolve the questions of if and how should we use sampling for evaluating recommendation. We introduce two approaches based on MLE (MaximalLikelihood Estimation) and its weighted variants, and ME(Maximal Entropy) principals to recover the empirical rank distribution, and then utilize them for metrics estimation. The experimental results show the advantages of using the new approaches for evaluating recommendation algorithms based on top-k metrics."

Besides encoding interaction sparsity, however, real networks often exhibit a multi-scale structure, in which agents can be grouped into communities, those communities further grouped, and so on, and where interactions among such groups may also exhibit sparsity. We present a general model of multi-scale network games that encodes such multi-level structure. We then develop several algorithmic approaches that leverage this multi-scale structure, and derive sufficient conditions for convergence of these to a Nash equilibrium. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches enable orders of magnitude improvements in scalability when computing Nash equilibria in such games. For example, we can solve previously intractable instances involving up to 1 million agents in under 15 minutes."

Recently, many domain adaptation (DA) methods use centroid to align the local distribution of different domains, that is, to align different classes. This improves the effect of domain adaptation, but domain differences exist not only between classes, but also between samples. This work rethinks what is the alignment between different domains, and studies how to achieve the real alignment between different domains. Previous DA methods only considered one distribution feature of aligned samples, such as full distribution or local distribution. In addition to aligning the global distribution, the real domain adaptation should also align the meso distribution and the micro distribution. Therefore, this study propose a double classifier method based on high confidence label (DCP). By aligning the centroid and the distribution between centroid and sample of different classifiers, the meso and micro distribution alignment of different domains is realized. In addition, in order to reduce the chain error caused by error marking, This study propose a high confidence marking method to reduce the marking error. To verify its versatility, this study evaluates DCP on digital recognition and target recognition data sets. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on most of the current domain adaptation benchmark datasets."

However, traditional Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in these systems compensate poorly for such transformations. In this paper, we target this problem by introducing Quaternion CNN, a network architecture which is intrinsically layer-wise equivariant and globally invariant under 3D rotations of an array of input vectors. We show empirically that this network indeed significantly outperforms a traditional CNN in a multi-user rotation-invariant gait classification setting .Lastly, we demonstrate how the kernels learned by this QCNN can also be visualized as basis-independent but origin- and chirality-dependent trajectory fragments in the euclidean space, thus yielding a novel mode of feature visualization and extraction."

While filter and channel pruning are preferable to other structure pruning methods in terms of realistic acceleration and hardware compatibility, pruning methods with a finer granularity, such as intra-channel pruning, are expected to be capable of yielding more compact and computationally efficient networks. Typical intra-channel pruning methods utilize a static and hand-crafted pruning granularity due to a large search space, which leaves room for improvement in their pruning performance. In this work, we introduce a novel structure pruning method, termed as dynamic structure pruning, to identify optimal pruning granularities for intra-channel pruning. In contrast to existing intra-channel pruning methods, the proposed method automatically optimizes dynamic pruning granularities in each layer while training deep neural networks. To achieve this, we propose a differentiable group learning method designed to efficiently learn a pruning granularity based on gradient-based learning of filter groups. The experimental results show that dynamic structure pruning achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance and better realistic acceleration on a GPU compared with channel pruning. In particular, it reduces the FLOPs of ResNet50 by 71.85% without accuracy degradation on the ImageNet dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/irishev/DSP."

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for identifying causal relationships. However, recent advancements in the theory of causal inference based on the foundations of structural causal models (SCMs) have allowed the identification of causal relationships from observational data, under certain assumptions. Survival analysis provides standard measures, such as the hazard ratio, to quantify the effects of an intervention. While hazard ratios are widely used in clinical and epidemiological studies for RCTs, a principled approach does not exist to compute hazard ratios for observational studies with SCMs. In this work, we review existing approaches to compute hazard ratios as well as their causal interpretation, if it exists. We also propose a novel approach to compute hazard ratios from observational studies using backdoor adjustment through SCMs and do-calculus. Finally, we evaluate the approach using experimental data for Ewing's sarcoma."

Recent works show that low rank tensor ring approximation is one of the most powerful tools to solve tensor completion problem. However, existing algorithms need predefined tensor ring rank which may be hard to determine in practice. To address the issue, we propose a hierarchical tensor ring decomposition for more compact representation. We use the standard tensor ring to decompose a tensor into several 3-order sub-tensors in the first layer, and each sub-tensor is further factorized by tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) in the second layer. In the low rank tensor completion based on the proposed decomposition, the zero elements in the 3-order core tensor are pruned in the second layer, which helps to automatically determinate the tensor ring rank. To further enhance the recovery performance, we use total variation to exploit the locally piece-wise smoothness data structure. The alternating direction method of multiplier can divide the optimization model into several subproblems, and each one can be solved efficiently. Numerical experiments on color images and hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts ones in terms of recovery accuracy."

Prior works in lottery tickets have primarily focused on the supervised learning setup, with several papers proposing effective ways of finding ""winning tickets"" in classification problems. In this paper, we confirm the existence of winning tickets in deep generative models such as GANs and VAEs. We show that the popular iterative magnitude pruning approach (with late rewinding) can be used with generative losses to find the winning tickets. This approach effectively yields tickets with sparsity up to 99% for AutoEncoders, 93% for VAEs and 89% for GANs on CIFAR and Celeb-A datasets. We also demonstrate the transferability of winning tickets across different generative models (GANs and VAEs) sharing the same architecture, suggesting that winning tickets have inductive biases that could help train a wide range of deep generative models. Furthermore, we show the practical benefits of lottery tickets in generative models by detecting tickets at very early stages in training called ""early-bird tickets"". Through early-bird tickets, we can achieve up to 88% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and 54% reduction in training time, making it possible to train large-scale generative models over tight resource constraints. These results out-perform existing early pruning methods like SNIP (Lee, Ajanthan, and Torr 2019) and GraSP (Wang, Zhang, and Grosse 2020).

We also show how to use kernel functions to construct prediction intervals of survival time estimates that are statistically valid for individuals similar to a test subject. These prediction intervals can use any kernel function, such as ones learned using our neural kernel learning framework or using random survival forests. Our experiments show that our neural kernel survival estimators are competitive with a variety of existing survival analysis methods, and that our prediction intervals can help compare different methods' uncertainties, even for estimators that do not use kernels. In particular, these prediction interval widths can be used as a new performance metric for survival analysis methods."

However, federated learning faces two main problems: semi-honest server privacy inference attacks and malicious client-side model theft. To address privacy inference attacks, parameter-based encrypted federated learning secure aggregation can be used. To address model theft, a watermark-based intellectual property protection scheme can verify model ownership. Although watermark-based intellectual property protection schemes can help verify model ownership, they are not sufficient to address the issue of continuous model theft by uncaught malicious clients in federated learning. Existing IP protection schemes that have the ability to track traitors are also not compatible with federated learning security aggregation. Thus, in this paper, we propose a Federated Client-side Intellectual Property Protection (FedCIP), which is compatible with federated learning security aggregation and has the ability to track traitors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first IP protection scheme in federated learning that is compatible with secure aggregation and tracking capabilities."

Due to the fact that past training data is not available, it is valuable to explore the influence difference on S and P among training examples, which may improve the learning pattern towards better SP. Inspired by Influence Function (IF), we first study example influence via adding perturbation to example weight and computing the influence derivation. To avoid the storage and calculation burden of Hessian inverse in neural networks, we propose a simple yet effective MetaSP algorithm to simulate the two key steps in the computation of IF and obtain the S- and P-aware example influence. Moreover, we propose to fuse two kinds of example influence by solving a dual-objective optimization problem, and obtain a fused influence towards SP Pareto optimality. The fused influence can be used to control the update of model and optimize the storage of rehearsal.

Moreover there is an increasing demand for the automated retinal layer segmentation which facilitates the retinal disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel multiprediction guided attention network (MPG-Net) for automated retinal layer segmentation in OCT images. The proposed method consists of two major steps to strengthen the discriminative power of a U-shape Fully convolutional network (FCN) for reliable automated segmentation. Firstly, the feature refinement module which adaptively re-weights the feature channels is exploited in the encoder to capture more informative features and discard information in irrelevant regions. Furthermore, we propose a multi-prediction guided attention mechanism which provides pixel-wise semantic prediction guidance to better recover the segmentation mask at each scale. This mechanism which transforms the deep supervision to supervised attention is able to guide feature aggregation with more semantic information between intermediate layers. Experiments on the publicly available Duke OCT dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method as well as an improved performance over other state-of-the-art approaches."

First, we propose a nonlocal feature aggregation module, weighted by both feature and spatial coherence, for feature embedding of the input correspondences. Second, we formulate a differentiable spectral matching module, supervised by pairwise spatial compatibility, to estimate the inlier confidence of each correspondence from the embedded features. With modest computation cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art hand-crafted and learning-based outlier rejection approaches on several real-world datasets by a significant margin.

We show that the sample complexity of optimization using these oracles is polynomial in the relevant parameters. The optimization algorithm that we provide for the comparator oracle is the first algorithm with a known rate of convergence that is polynomial in the number of dimensions.

An efficient variational inference procedure is developed that approximates the posterior distributions of the latent probabilistic multi-view layer while taking into account the solution of probabilistic CCA. A generalization to models with arbitrary number of views is also proposed. The empirical studies confirm that the proposed deep generative multi-view model can successfully extend deep variational inference to multi-view learning while it efficiently integrates the relationship between multiple views to alleviate the difficulty of learning."

In this work, we develop a tensor method to predict the evolution of epidemic trends for many regions simultaneously. We construct a 3-way spatio-temporal tensor (location, attribute, time) of case counts and propose a nonnegative tensor factorization with latent epidemiological model regularization named STELAR. Unlike standard tensor factorization methods which cannot predict slabs ahead, STELAR enables long-term prediction by incorporating latent temporal regularization through a system of discrete-time difference equations of a widely adopted epidemiological model. We use latent instead of location/attribute-level epidemiological dynamics to capture common epidemic profile sub-types and improve collaborative learning and prediction. We conduct experiments using both county- and state-level COVID-19 data and show that our model can identify interesting latent patterns of the epidemic. Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of our method and show superior performance compared to the baselines, achieving up to 21% lower root mean square error and 25% lower mean absolute error for county-level prediction."
789,aaai,2021,Compilation Complexity of Multi-Winner Voting Rules (Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17901,"In many real world elections, agents are not required to rank all candidates. We study three of the most common methods used to modify voting rules to deal with such partial votes. These methods modify scoring rules (like the Borda count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However, with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence, the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes."
790,aaai,2021,Learning Generalized Relational Heuristic Networks for Model-Agnostic Planning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16983,"Computing goal-directed behavior is essential to designing efficient AI systems. Due to the computational complexity of planning, current approaches rely primarily upon hand-coded symbolic action models and hand-coded heuristic-function generators for efficiency. Learned heuristics for such problems have been of limited utility as they are difficult to apply to problems with objects and object quantities that are significantly different from those in the training data. This paper develops a new approach for learning generalized heuristics in the absence of symbolic action models using deep neural networks that utilize an input predicate vocabulary but are agnostic to object names and quantities. It uses an abstract state representation to facilitate data efficient, generalizable learning. Empirical evaluation on a range of benchmark domains show that in contrast to prior approaches, generalized heuristics computed by this method can be transferred easily to problems with different objects and with object quantities much larger than those in the training data."

This article deals with the optimization of the energy conversion of a grid-connected photovoltaic system. The novelty is to develop an intelligent maximum power point tracking technique using artificial neural network algorithms. Purpose. Intelligent maximum power point tracking technique is developed in order to improve the photovoltaic system performances under the variations of the temperature and irradiation. Methods. This work is to calculate and follow the maximum power point for a photovoltaic system operating according to the artificial intelligence mechanism is and the latter is used an adaptive modified perturbation and observation maximum power point tracking algorithm based on function sign to generate an specify duty cycle applied to DC-DC converter, where we use the feed forward artificial neural network type trained by Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation. Results. The photovoltaic system that we chose to simulate and apply this intelligent technique on it is a stand-alone photovoltaic system. According to the results obtained from simulation of the photovoltaic system using adaptive modified perturbation and observation artificial neural network the efficiency and the quality of the production of energy from photovoltaic is increased. Practical value. The proposed algorithm is validated by a dSPACE DS1104 for different operating conditions. All practice results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm."
792,aaai,2021,StarNet: towards Weakly Supervised Few-Shot Object Detection,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16268,"Weakly supervised object detection is a challenging task when provided with image category supervision but required to learn, at the same time, object locations and object detectors. The inconsistency between the weak supervision and learning objectives introduces significant randomness to object locations and ambiguity to detectors. In this paper, a min-entropy latent model (MELM) is proposed for weakly supervised object detection. Min-entropy serves as a model to learn object locations and a metric to measure the randomness of object localization during learning. It aims to principally reduce the variance of learned instances and alleviate the ambiguity of detectors. MELM is decomposed into three components including proposal clique partition, object clique discovery, and object localization. MELM is optimized with a recurrent learning algorithm, which leverages continuation optimization to solve the challenging non-convexity problem. Experiments demonstrate that MELM significantly improves the performance of weakly supervised object detection, weakly supervised object localization, and image classification, against the state-of-the-art approaches."
793,aaai,2021,A Deep Learning Framework for Improving Lameness Identification in Dairy Cattle,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17902,"There is a critical need to develop and validate non-invasive animal-based indicators of affective states in livestock species, in order to integrate them into on-farm assessment protocols, potentially via the use of precision livestock farming (PLF) tools. One such promising approach is the use of vocal indicators. The acoustic structure of vocalizations and their functions were extensively studied in important livestock species, such as pigs, horses, poultry and goats, yet cattle remain understudied in this context to date. Cows were shown to produce two types vocalizations: low-frequency calls (LF), produced with the mouth closed, or partially closed, for close distance contacts and open mouth emitted high-frequency calls (HF), produced for long distance communication, with the latter considered to be largely associated with negative affective states. Moreover, cattle vocalizations were shown to contain information on individuality across a wide range of contexts, both negative and positive. Nowadays, dairy cows are facing a series of negative challenges and stressors in a typical production cycle, making vocalizations during negative affective states of special interest for research. One contribution of this study is providing the largest to date pre-processed (clean from noises) dataset of lactating adult multiparous dairy cows during negative affective states induced by visual isolation challenges. Here we present two computational frameworks - deep learning based and explainable machine learning based, to classify high and low-frequency cattle calls, and individual cow voice recognition. Our models in these two frameworks reached 87.2% and 89.4% accuracy for LF and HF classification, with 68.9% and 72.5% accuracy rates for the cow individual identification, respectively."

This paper proposes an algorithm, which is ensured to have global convergence guarantees in the practical regime beyond the NTK regime, under a verifiable condition called the expressivity condition. The expressivity condition is defined to be both data-dependent and architecture-dependent, which is the key property that makes our results applicable for practical settings beyond the NTK regime. On the one hand, the expressivity condition is theoretically proven to hold data-independently for fully-connected deep neural networks with narrow hidden layers and a single wide layer. On the other hand, the expressivity condition is numerically shown to hold data-dependently for deep (convolutional) ResNet with batch normalization with various standard image datasets. We also show that the proposed algorithm has generalization performances comparable with those of the heuristic algorithm, with the same hyper-parameters and total number of iterations. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a step towards providing theoretical guarantees for deep learning in the practical regime."
795,aaai,2021,Instrumental Variable-based Identification for Causal Effects using Covariate Information,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17440,"Instrumental variables are commonly used to estimate effects of a treatment afflicted by unmeasured confounding, and in practice instruments are often continuous (e.g., measures of distance, or treatment preference). However, available methods for continuous instruments have important limitations: they either require restrictive parametric assumptions for identification, or else rely on modeling both the outcome and treatment process well (and require modeling effect modification by all adjustment covariates). In this work we develop the first semiparametric doubly robust estimators of the local instrumental variable effect curve, i.e., the effect among those who would take treatment for instrument values above some threshold and not below. In addition to being robust to misspecification of either the instrument or treatment/outcome processes, our approach also incorporates information about the instrument mechanism and allows for flexible data-adaptive estimation of effect modification. We discuss asymptotic properties under weak conditions, and use the methods to study infant mortality effects of neonatal intensive care units with high versus low technical capacity, using travel time as an instrument."

However, we clearly realize our inability to cover all the useful and interesting results concerning Bayesian matrix decomposition and given the paucity of scope to present this discussion, e.g., the separated analysis of variational inference for conducting the optimization. We refer the reader to literature in the field of Bayesian analysis for a more detailed introduction to the related fields.   This book is primarily a summary of purpose, significance of important Bayesian matrix decomposition methods, e.g., real-valued decomposition, nonnegative matrix factorization, Bayesian interpolative decomposition, and the origin and complexity of the methods which shed light on their applications. The mathematical prerequisite is a first course in statistics and linear algebra. Other than this modest background, the development is self-contained, with rigorous proof provided throughout."

Structured descriptions of products embedded in HTML pages are now not uncommon, especially on e-commerce websites. The Web Data Commons (WDC) project has extracted schema.org data at scale from webpages in the Common Crawl and made it available as an RDF `knowledge graph' at scale. The portion of this data that specifically describes products offers a golden opportunity for researchers and small companies to leverage it for analytics and downstream applications. Yet, because of the broad and expansive scope of this data, it is not evident whether the data is usable in its raw form. In this paper, we do a detailed empirical study on the product-specific schema.org data made available by WDC. Rather than simple analysis, the goal of our study is to devise an empirically grounded set of best practices for using and consuming WDC product-specific schema.org data. Our studies reveal six best practices, each of which is justified by experimental data and analysis."
798,aaai,2021,On Generating Plausible Counterfactual and Semi-Factual Explanations for Deep Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17377,"There is a growing concern that the recent progress made in AI, especially regarding the predictive competence of deep learning models, will be undermined by a failure to properly explain their operation and outputs. In response to this disquiet counterfactual explanations have become massively popular in eXplainable AI (XAI) due to their proposed computational psychological, and legal benefits. In contrast however, semifactuals, which are a similar way humans commonly explain their reasoning, have surprisingly received no attention. Most counterfactual methods address tabular rather than image data, partly due to the nondiscrete nature of the latter making good counterfactuals difficult to define. Additionally generating plausible looking explanations which lie on the data manifold is another issue which hampers progress. This paper advances a novel method for generating plausible counterfactuals (and semifactuals) for black box CNN classifiers doing computer vision. The present method, called PlausIble Exceptionality-based Contrastive Explanations (PIECE), modifies all exceptional features in a test image to be normal from the perspective of the counterfactual class (hence concretely defining a counterfactual). Two controlled experiments compare this method to others in the literature, showing that PIECE not only generates the most plausible counterfactuals on several measures, but also the best semifactuals."

Unlike previous works that only make cautionary claims of discrimination and de-biases data after its generation, this paper attempts to prioritize unfair sources before mitigating their unfairness in the real-world. We assume that a causal bayesian network, representative of the data generation procedure, along with the sensitive nodes, that result in unfairness, are given. We quantify Edge Flow, which is the belief flowing along an edge by attenuating the indirect path influences, and use it to quantify Edge Unfairness. We prove that cumulative unfairness is non-existent in any decision, like judicial bail, towards any sensitive groups, like race, when the edge unfairness is absent, given an error-free linear model of conditional probability. We then measure the potential to mitigate the cumulative unfairness when edge unfairness is decreased. Based on these measures, we propose an unfair edge prioritization algorithm that prioritizes the unfair edges and a discrimination removal procedure that de-biases the generated data distribution. The experimental section validates the specifications used for quantifying the above measures."
800,aaai,2021,Improving Fairness and Privacy in Selection Problems,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16986,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. However, alongside all its advancements, problems have also emerged, such as privacy violations, security issues and model fairness. Differential privacy, as a promising mathematical model, has several attractive properties that can help solve these problems, making it quite a valuable tool. For this reason, differential privacy has been broadly applied in AI but to date, no study has documented which differential privacy mechanisms can or have been leveraged to overcome its issues or the properties that make this possible. In this paper, we show that differential privacy can do more than just privacy preservation. It can also be used to improve security, stabilize learning, build fair models, and impose composition in selected areas of AI. With a focus on regular machine learning, distributed machine learning, deep learning, and multi-agent systems, the purpose of this article is to deliver a new view on many possibilities for improving AI performance with differential privacy techniques."

In this work, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled decision-making policy is constructed for autonomous vehicles to address the overtaking behaviors on the highway. First, a highway driving environment is founded, wherein the ego vehicle aims to pass through the surrounding vehicles with an efficient and safe maneuver. A hierarchical control framework is presented to control these vehicles, which indicates the upper-level manages the driving decisions, and the lower-level cares about the supervision of vehicle speed and acceleration. Then, the particular DRL method named dueling deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm is applied to derive the highway decision-making strategy. The exhaustive calculative procedures of deep Q-network and DDQN algorithms are discussed and compared. Finally, a series of estimation simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed highway decision-making policy. The advantages of the proposed framework in convergence rate and control performance are illuminated. Simulation results reveal that the DDQN-based overtaking policy could accomplish highway driving tasks efficiently and safely."

Past works in this field have tried using various data imputation techniques to fill in the missing data, or training neural networks (NNs) with the missing data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach that clusters similar input features together using hierarchical clustering and then trains proportionately split neural networks with a joint loss. We evaluate this approach on a series of benchmark datasets and show promising improvements even with simple imputation techniques. We attribute this to learning through clusters of similar features in our model architecture. The source code is available at https://github.com/usarawgi911/Robustness-to-Missing-Features"

Prominent lines of prior research across multiple disciplines have observed and analyzed growing polarization in social media. In this paper, we present a new methodology that offers a fresh perspective on interpreting polarization through the lens of machine translation. With a novel proposition that two sub-communities are speaking in two different \emph{languages}, we demonstrate that modern machine translation methods can provide a simple yet powerful and interpretable framework to understand the differences between two (or more) large-scale social media discussion data sets at the granularity of words. Via a substantial corpus of 86.6 million comments by 6.5 million users on over 200,000 news videos hosted by YouTube channels of four prominent US news networks, we demonstrate that simple word-level and phrase-level translation pairs can reveal deep insights into the current political divide -- what is \emph{black lives matter} to one can be \emph{all lives matter} to the other."
805,aaai,2021,Representing the Unification of Text Featurization using a Context-Free Grammar,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17814,"When parsing unrestricted language, wide-covering grammars often undergenerate. Undergeneration can be tackled either by sentence correction, or by grammar correction. This thesis concentrates upon automatic grammar correction (or machine learning of grammar) as a solution to the problem of undergeneration. Broadly speaking, grammar correction approaches can be classified as being either {\it data-driven}, or {\it model-based}. Data-driven learners use data-intensive methods to acquire grammar. They typically use grammar formalisms unsuited to the needs of practical text processing and cannot guarantee that the resulting grammar is adequate for subsequent semantic interpretation. That is, data-driven learners acquire grammars that generate strings that humans would judge to be grammatically ill-formed (they {\it overgenerate}) and fail to assign linguistically plausible parses. Model-based learners are knowledge-intensive and are reliant for success upon the completeness of a {\it model of grammaticality}. But in practice, the model will be incomplete. Given that in this thesis we deal with undergeneration by learning, we hypothesise that the combined use of data-driven and model-based learning would allow data-driven learning to compensate for model-based learning's incompleteness, whilst model-based learning would compensate for data-driven learning's unsoundness. We describe a system that we have used to test the hypothesis empirically. The system combines data-driven and model-based learning to acquire unification-based grammars that are more suitable for practical text parsing. Using the Spoken English Corpus as data, and by quantitatively measuring undergeneration, overgeneration and parse plausibility, we show that this hypothesis is correct."
806,aaai,2021,GLISTER: Generalization based Data Subset Selection for Efficient and Robust Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16988,"Large scale machine learning and deep models are extremely data-hungry. Unfortunately, obtaining large amounts of labeled data is expensive, and training state-of-the-art models (with hyperparameter tuning) requires significant computing resources and time. Secondly, real-world data is noisy and imbalanced. As a result, several recent papers try to make the training process more efficient and robust. However, most existing work either focuses on robustness or efficiency, but not both. In this work, we introduce Glister, a GeneraLIzation based data Subset selecTion for Efficient and Robust learning framework. We formulate Glister as a mixed discrete-continuous bi-level optimization problem to select a subset of the training data, which maximizes the log-likelihood on a held-out validation set. Next, we propose an iterative online algorithm Glister-Online, which performs data selection iteratively along with the parameter updates and can be applied to any loss-based learning algorithm. We then show that for a rich class of loss functions including cross-entropy, hinge-loss, squared-loss, and logistic-loss, the inner discrete data selection is an instance of (weakly) submodular optimization, and we analyze conditions for which Glister-Online reduces the validation loss and converges. Finally, we propose Glister-Active, an extension to batch active learning, and we empirically demonstrate the performance of Glister on a wide range of tasks including, (a) data selection to reduce training time, (b) robust learning under label noise and imbalance settings, and (c) batch-active learning with several deep and shallow models. We show that our framework improves upon state of the art both in efficiency and accuracy (in cases (a) and (c)) and is more efficient compared to other state-of-the-art robust learning algorithms in case (b)."
807,aaai,2021,Towards a Better Understanding of VR Sickness: Physical Symptom Prediction for VR Contents,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i1.16166,"We address the black-box issue of VR sickness assessment (VRSA) by evaluating the level of physical symptoms of VR sickness. For the VR contents inducing the similar VR sickness level, the physical symptoms can vary depending on the characteristics of the contents. Most of existing VRSA methods focused on assessing the overall VR sickness score. To make better understanding of VR sickness, it is required to predict and provide the level of major symptoms of VR sickness rather than overall degree of VR sickness. In this paper, we predict the degrees of main physical symptoms affecting the overall degree of VR sickness, which are disorientation, nausea, and oculomotor. In addition, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for VRSA including 360 videos with various frame rates, physiological signals, and subjective scores. On VRSA benchmark and our newly collected dataset, our approach shows a potential to not only achieve the highest correlation with subjective scores, but also to better understand which symptoms are the main causes of VR sickness."

Though recent advances using deep learning have shown success for many segmentation tasks, large datasets are required for high performance and the annotation process is both time consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, we propose a 3D few shot segmentation framework for accurate organ segmentation using limited training samples of the target organ annotation. To achieve this, a U-Net like network is designed to predict segmentation by learning the relationship between 2D slices of support data and a query image, including a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) that learns consistency of encoded features between adjacent slices. Also, we introduce a transfer learning method to adapt the characteristics of the target image and organ by updating the model before testing with arbitrary support and query data sampled from the support data. We evaluate our proposed model using three 3D CT datasets with annotations of different organs. Our model yielded significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art few shot segmentation models and was comparable to a fully supervised model trained with more target training data."
809,aaai,2021,Split-and-Bridge: Adaptable Class Incremental Learning within a Single Neural Network,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16991,"Continual learning has been a major problem in the deep learning community, where the main challenge is how to effectively learn a series of newly arriving tasks without forgetting the knowledge of previous tasks. Initiated by Learning without Forgetting (LwF), many of the existing works report that knowledge distillation is effective to preserve the previous knowledge, and hence they commonly use a soft label for the old task, namely a knowledge distillation (KD) loss, together with a class label for the new task, namely a cross entropy (CE) loss, to form a composite loss for a single neural network. However, this approach suffers from learning the knowledge by a CE loss as a KD loss often more strongly influences the objective function when they are in a competitive situation within a single network. This could be a critical problem particularly in a class incremental scenario, where the knowledge across tasks as well as within the new task, both of which can only be acquired by a CE loss, is essentially learned due to the existence of a unified classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method, called Split-and-Bridge, which can successfully address the above problem by partially splitting a neural network into two partitions for training the new task separated from the old task and re-connecting them for learning the knowledge across tasks. In our thorough experimental analysis, our Split-and-Bridge method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in KD-based continual learning."

Existing WSSS methods utilize localization maps from the classification network to generate pseudo segmentation labels. However, since localization maps obtained from the classifier focus only on sparse discriminative object regions, it is difficult to generate high-quality segmentation labels. To address this issue, we introduce discriminative region suppression (DRS) module that is a simple yet effective method to expand object activation regions. DRS suppresses the attention on discriminative regions and spreads it to adjacent non-discriminative regions, generating dense localization maps. DRS requires few or no additional parameters and can be plugged into any network. Furthermore, we introduce an additional learning strategy to give a self-enhancement of localization maps, named localization map refinement learning. Benefiting from this refinement learning, localization maps are refined and enhanced by recovering some missing parts or removing noise itself. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, our approach achieves mIoU 71.4% on the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark using only image-level labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/qjadud1994/DRS."
811,aaai,2021,Why and What to Teach: AI Curriculum for Elementary School,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17833,"Some education researchers have claimed that we should not teach the Bohr model of the atom because it inhibits students' ability to learn the true quantum nature of electrons in atoms. Although the evidence for this claim is weak, many have accepted it. This claim has implications for how to present atoms in classes ranging from elementary school to graduate school. We present results from a study designed to test this claim by developing a curriculum on models of the atom, including the Bohr and Schrodinger models. We examine student descriptions of atoms on final exams in transformed modern physics classes using various versions of this curriculum. We find that if the curriculum does not include sufficient connections between different models, many students still have a Bohr-like view of atoms, rather than a more accurate Schrodinger model. However, with an improved curriculum designed to develop model-building skills and with better integration between different models, it is possible to get most students to describe atoms using the Schrodinger model. In comparing our results with previous research, we find that comparing and contrasting different models is a key feature of a curriculum that helps students move beyond the Bohr model and adopt Schrodinger's view of the atom. We find that understanding the reasons for the development of models is much more difficult for students than understanding the features of the models. We also present interactive computer simulations designed to help students build models of the atom more effectively."

Our MAC aims to reduce video representation's spatial and temporal redundancy in the VidLP model by a mask sampling mechanism to improve pre-training efficiency. Comparing conventional temporal sparse sampling, we propose to randomly mask a high ratio of spatial regions and only feed visible regions into the encoder as sparse spatial sampling. Similarly, we adopt the mask sampling technique for text inputs for consistency. Instead of blindly applying the mask-then-prediction paradigm from MAE, we propose a masked-then-alignment paradigm for efficient video-text alignment. The motivation is that video-text retrieval tasks rely on high-level alignment rather than low-level reconstruction, and multimodal alignment with masked modeling encourages the model to learn a robust and general multimodal representation from incomplete and unstable inputs. Coupling these designs enables efficient end-to-end pre-training: reduce FLOPs (60% off), accelerate pre-training (by 3x), and improve performance. Our MAC achieves state-of-the-art results on various video-text retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. Our approach is omnivorous to input modalities. With minimal modifications, we achieve competitive results on image-text retrieval tasks."
813,aaai,2021,Cross-Domain Grouping and Alignment for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i3.16274,"Existing techniques to adapt semantic segmentation networks across the source and target domains within deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) deal with all the samples from the two domains in a global or category-aware manner. They do not consider an inter-class variation within the target domain itself or estimated category, providing the limitation to encode the domains having a multi-modal data distribution. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable clustering module, and a novel domain adaptation framework called cross-domain grouping and alignment. To cluster the samples across domains with an aim to maximize the domain alignment without forgetting precise segmentation ability on the source domain, we present two loss functions, in particular, for encouraging semantic consistency and orthogonality among the clusters. We also present a loss so as to solve a class imbalance problem, which is the other limitation of the previous methods. Our experiments show that our method consistently boosts the adaptation performance in semantic segmentation, outperforming the state-of-the-arts on various domain adaptation settings."

In order to adapt to novel zero-shot tasks, our meta-learner learns from the model parameters of known tasks (with ground truth) and the correlation of known tasks to zero-shot tasks. Such intuition finds its foothold in cognitive science, where a subject (human baby) can adapt to a novel-concept (depth understanding) by correlating it with old concepts (hand movement or self-motion), without receiving explicit supervision. We evaluated our model on the Taskonomy dataset, with four tasks as zero-shot: surface-normal, room layout, depth, and camera pose estimation. These tasks were chosen based on the data acquisition complexity and the complexity associated with the learning process using a deep network. Our proposed methodology out-performs state-of-the-art models (which use ground truth)on each of our zero-shot tasks, showing promise on zero-shot task transfer. We also conducted extensive experiments to study the various choices of our methodology, as well as showed how the proposed method can also be used in transfer learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstsuch effort on zero-shot learning in the task space."
815,aaai,2021,Visual Concept Reasoning Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16995,"A split-transform-merge strategy has been broadly used as an architectural constraint in convolutional neural networks for visual recognition tasks. It approximates sparsely connected networks by explicitly defining multiple branches to simultaneously learn representations with different visual concepts or properties. Dependencies or interactions between these representations are typically defined by dense and local operations, however, without any adaptiveness or high-level reasoning. In this work, we propose to exploit this strategy and combine it with our Visual Concept Reasoning Networks (VCRNet) to enable reasoning between high-level visual concepts. We associate each branch with a visual concept and derive a compact concept state by selecting a few local descriptors through an attention module. These concept states are then updated by graph-based interaction and used to adaptively modulate the local descriptors. We describe our proposed model by split-transform-attend-interact-modulate-merge stages, which are implemented by opting for a highly modularized architecture. Extensive experiments on visual recognition tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, scene recognition, and action recognition show that our proposed model, VCRNet, consistently improves the performance by increasing the number of parameters by less than 1%."
816,aaai,2021,Student Knowledge Prediction for Teacher-Student Interaction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17832,"Students acquire knowledge as they interact with a variety of learning materials, such as video lectures, problems, and discussions. Modeling student knowledge at each point during their learning period and understanding the contribution of each learning material to student knowledge are essential for detecting students' knowledge gaps and recommending learning materials to them. Current student knowledge modeling techniques mostly rely on one type of learning material, mainly problems, to model student knowledge growth. These approaches ignore the fact that students also learn from other types of material. In this paper, we propose a student knowledge model that can capture knowledge growth as a result of learning from a diverse set of learning resource types while unveiling the association between the learning materials of different types. Our multi-view knowledge model (MVKM) incorporates a flexible knowledge increase objective on top of a multi-view tensor factorization to capture occasional forgetting while representing student knowledge and learning material concepts in a lower-dimensional latent space. We evaluate our model in different experiments toshow that it can accurately predict students' future performance, differentiate between knowledge gain in different student groups and concepts, and unveil hidden similarities across learning materials of different types."

Precise and automatic detection of abnormal ECG patterns is beneficial to both physicians and patients. In the automatic detection of abnormal ECG patterns, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown significant achievements. However, DNNs require large amount of labeled data, which are often expensive to obtain. On the other hand, recent research have shown by randomly combining data augmentations can improve image classification accuracy. Thus, in this work we explore data augmentation suitable for ECG data and propose ECG Augment. We show by introducing ECG Augment, we can improve classification of atrial fibrillation with single lead ECG data, without changing an architecture of DNN."
818,aaai,2021,Commonsense Knowledge Augmentation for Low-Resource Languages via Adversarial Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i7.16793,"This paper focuses on analyzing and improving the commonsense ability of recent popular vision-language (VL) models. Despite the great success, we observe that existing VL-models still lack commonsense knowledge/reasoning ability (e.g., ""Lemons are sour""), which is a vital component towards artificial general intelligence. Through our analysis, we find one important reason is that existing large-scale VL datasets do not contain much commonsense knowledge, which motivates us to improve the commonsense of VL-models from the data perspective. Rather than collecting a new VL training dataset, we propose a more scalable strategy, i.e., ""Data Augmentation with kNowledge graph linearization for CommonsensE capability"" (DANCE). It can be viewed as one type of data augmentation technique, which can inject commonsense knowledge into existing VL datasets on the fly during training. More specifically, we leverage the commonsense knowledge graph (e.g., ConceptNet) and create variants of text description in VL datasets via bidirectional sub-graph sequentialization. For better commonsense evaluation, we further propose the first retrieval-based commonsense diagnostic benchmark. By conducting extensive experiments on some representative VL-models, we demonstrate that our DANCE technique is able to significantly improve the commonsense ability while maintaining the performance on vanilla retrieval tasks.

This is a phenomenon in which, during single-step adversarial training, the robust accuracy against projected gradient descent (PGD) suddenly decreases to 0% after a few epochs, whereas the robust accuracy against fast gradient sign method (FGSM) increases to 100%. In this paper, we demonstrate that catastrophic overfitting is very closely related to the characteristic of single-step adversarial training which uses only adversarial examples with the maximum perturbation, and not all adversarial examples in the adversarial direction, which leads to decision boundary distortion and a highly curved loss surface. Based on this observation, we propose a simple method that not only prevents catastrophic overfitting, but also overrides the belief that it is difficult to prevent multi-step adversarial attacks with single-step adversarial training."

Our particular interest lies in extrapolating solutions in time beyond the range of temporal domain used in training. Our choice for a baseline method is physics-informed neural network (PINN) [Raissi et al., J. Comput. Phys., 378:686--707, 2019] because the method parameterizes not only the solutions but also the equations that describe the dynamics of physical processes. We demonstrate that PINN performs poorly on extrapolation tasks in many benchmark problems. To address this, we propose a novel method for better training PINN and demonstrate that our newly enhanced PINNs can accurately extrapolate solutions in time. Our method shows up to 72% smaller errors than existing methods in terms of the standard L2-norm metric."
821,aaai,2021,End-to-End Differentiable Learning to HDR Image Synthesis for Multi-exposure Images,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16272,"Recently, high dynamic range (HDR) image reconstruction based on the multiple exposure stack from a given single exposure utilizes a deep learning framework to generate high-quality HDR images. These conventional networks focus on the exposure transfer task to reconstruct the multi-exposure stack. Therefore, they often fail to fuse the multi-exposure stack into a perceptually pleasant HDR image as the inversion artifacts occur. We tackle the problem in stack reconstruction-based methods by proposing a novel framework with a fully differentiable high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) process. By explicitly using the loss, which compares the network's output with the ground truth HDR image, our framework enables a neural network that generates the multiple exposure stack for HDRI to train stably. In other words, our differentiable HDR synthesis layer helps the deep neural network to train to create multi-exposure stacks while reflecting the precise correlations between multi-exposure images in the HDRI process. In addition, our network uses the image decomposition and the recursive process to facilitate the exposure transfer task and to adaptively respond to recursion frequency. The experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results in terms of both the exposure transfer tasks and the whole HDRI process."
822,aaai,2021,Neural Sequence-to-grid Module for Learning Symbolic Rules,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16994,"Neuro-symbolic rule learning has attracted lots of attention as it offers better interpretability than pure neural models and scales better than symbolic rule learning. A recent approach named pix2rule proposes a neural Disjunctive Normal Form (neural DNF) module to learn symbolic rules with feed-forward layers. Although proved to be effective in synthetic binary classification, pix2rule has not been applied to more challenging tasks such as multi-label and multi-class classifications over real-world data. In this paper, we address this limitation by extending the neural DNF module to (i) support rule learning in real-world multi-class and multi-label classification tasks, (ii) enforce the symbolic property of mutual exclusivity (i.e. predicting exactly one class) in multi-class classification, and (iii) explore its scalability over large inputs and outputs. We train a vanilla neural DNF model similar to pix2rule's neural DNF module for multi-label classification, and we propose a novel extended model called neural DNF-EO (Exactly One) which enforces mutual exclusivity in multi-class classification. We evaluate the classification performance, scalability and interpretability of our neural DNF-based models, and compare them against pure neural models and a state-of-the-art symbolic rule learner named FastLAS. We demonstrate that our neural DNF-based models perform similarly to neural networks, but provide better interpretability by enabling the extraction of logical rules. Our models also scale well when the rule search space grows in size, in contrast to FastLAS, which fails to learn in multi-class classification tasks with 200 classes and in all multi-label settings."
823,aaai,2021,Visual Comfort Aware-Reinforcement Learning for Depth Adjustment of Stereoscopic 3D Images,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i2.16270,"Depth adjustment aims to enhance the visual experience of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) images, which accompanied with improving visual comfort and depth perception. For a human expert, the depth adjustment procedure is a sequence of iterative decision making. The human expert iteratively adjusts the depth until he is satisfied with the both levels of visual comfort and the perceived depth. In this work, we present a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for depth adjustment named VCA-RL (Visual Comfort Aware Reinforcement Learning) to explicitly model human sequential decision making in depth editing operations. We formulate the depth adjustment process as a Markov decision process where actions are defined as camera movement operations to control the distance between the left and right cameras. Our agent is trained based on the guidance of an objective visual comfort assessment metric to learn the optimal sequence of camera movement actions in terms of perceptual aspects in stereoscopic viewing. With extensive experiments and user studies, we show the effectiveness of our VCA-RL model on three different S3D databases."

MDR explicitly disturbs a learning procedure by regularizing pairwise distances between embedding vectors into multiple levels that represents a degree of similarity between a pair. In the training stage, the model is trained with both MDR and an existing loss function of deep metric learning, simultaneously; the two losses interfere with the objective of each other, and it makes the learning process difficult. Moreover, MDR prevents some examples from being ignored or overly influenced in the learning process. These allow the parameters of the embedding network to be settle on a local optima with better generalization. Without bells and whistles, MDR with simple Triplet loss achieves the-state-of-the-art performance in various benchmark datasets: CUB-200-2011, Cars-196, Stanford Online Products, and In-Shop Clothes Retrieval. We extensively perform ablation studies on its behaviors to show the effectiveness of MDR. By easily adopting our MDR, the previous approaches can be improved in performance and generalization ability."

However, they are not reliable when recognizing online and personalized facial expressions, e.g., for person-specific affective understanding. In this paper, we present a neural model based on a conditional adversarial autoencoder to learn how to represent and edit general emotion expressions. We then propose Grow-When-Required networks as personalized affective memories to learn individualized aspects of emotion expressions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on emotion recognition when evaluated on \textit{in-the-wild} datasets. Furthermore, our experiments include ablation studies and neural visualizations in order to explain the behavior of our model."
826,aaai,2021,Counterfactual Fairness with Disentangled Causal Effect Variational Autoencoder,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.16990,"The problem of fair classification can be mollified if we develop a method to remove the embedded sensitive information from the classification features. This line of separating the sensitive information is developed through the causal inference, and the causal inference enables the counterfactual generations to contrast the what-if case of the opposite sensitive attribute. Along with this separation with the causality, a frequent assumption in the deep latent causal model defines a single latent variable to absorb the entire exogenous uncertainty of the causal graph. However, we claim that such structure cannot distinguish the 1) information caused by the intervention (i.e., sensitive variable) and 2) information correlated with the intervention from the data. Therefore, this paper proposes Disentangled Causal Effect Variational Autoencoder (DCEVAE) to resolve this limitation by disentangling the exogenous uncertainty into two latent variables: either 1) independent to interventions or 2) correlated to interventions without causality. Particularly, our disentangling approach preserves the latent variable correlated to interventions in generating counterfactual examples. We show that our method estimates the total effect and the counterfactual effect without a complete causal graph. By adding a fairness regularization, DCEVAE generates a counterfactual fair dataset while losing less original information. Also, DCEVAE generates natural counterfactual images by only flipping sensitive information. Additionally, we theoretically show the differences in the covariance structures of DCEVAE and prior works from the perspective of the latent disentanglement."

However, existing conversational recommendation systems (CRS) ignore the advantage of user interest shift in connecting recommendation and conversation, which leads to an ineffective loose coupling structure of CRS. To address this issue, by modeling the recommendation actions as recommendation paths in a knowledge graph (KG), we propose DICR (Dual Imitation for Conversational Recommendation), which designs a dual imitation to explicitly align the recommendation paths and user interest shift paths in a recommendation module and a conversation module, respectively. By exchanging alignment signals, DICR achieves bidirectional promotion between recommendation and conversation modules and generates high-quality responses with accurate recommendations and coherent explanations. Experiments demonstrate that DICR outperforms the state-of-the-art models on recommendation and conversation performance with automatic, human, and novel explainability metrics."

However, current evaluation metrics consider only surface features or utterance-level semantics, without explicitly considering the fine-grained topic transition dynamics of dialogue flows. Here, we first consider that the graph structure constituted with topics in a dialogue can accurately depict the underlying communication logic, which is a more natural way to produce persuasive metrics. Capitalized on the topic-level dialogue graph, we propose a new evaluation metric GRADE, which stands for Graph-enhanced Representations for Automatic Dialogue Evaluation. Specifically, GRADE incorporates both coarse-grained utterance-level contextualized representations and fine-grained topic-level graph representations to evaluate dialogue coherence. The graph representations are obtained by reasoning over topic-level dialogue graphs enhanced with the evidence from a commonsense graph, including k-hop neighboring representations and hop-attention weights. Experimental results show that our GRADE significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art metrics on measuring diverse dialogue models in terms of the Pearson and Spearman correlations with human judgements. Besides, we release a new large-scale human evaluation benchmark to facilitate future research on automatic metrics."

While the builders of existing image-text retrieval datasets strive to ensure that the caption matches the linked image, they cannot prevent a caption from fitting other images. We observe that such a many-to-many matching phenomenon is quite common in the widely-used retrieval datasets, where one caption can describe up to 178 images. These large matching-lost data not only confuse the model in training but also weaken the evaluation accuracy. Inspired by visual and textual entailment tasks, we propose a multi-modal entailment classifier to determine whether a sentence is entailed by an image plus its linked captions. Subsequently, we revise the image-text retrieval datasets by adding these entailed captions as additional weak labels of an image and develop a universal variable learning rate strategy to teach a retrieval model to distinguish the entailed captions from other negative samples. In experiments, we manually annotate an entailment-corrected image-text retrieval dataset for evaluation. The results demonstrate that the proposed entailment classifier achieves about 78% accuracy and consistently improves the performance of image-text retrieval baselines."

However, probabilistic computation presents significant challenges due to its inherent complexity. In this paper, we develop an efficient and interpretable probabilistic computation framework by truncating the probabilistic representation up to its first two moments, i.e., mean and covariance. We instantiate the framework by training a deterministic surrogate of a stochastic network that learns the complex probabilistic representation via combinations of simple activations, encapsulating the non-linearities coupling of the mean and covariance. We show that when the mean is supervised for optimizing the task objective, the unsupervised covariance spontaneously emerging from the non-linear coupling with the mean faithfully captures the uncertainty associated with model predictions. Our research highlights the inherent computability and simplicity of probabilistic computation, enabling its wider application in large-scale settings."

A key difference from other crew scheduling problems is that drivers can be exchanged between buses en route. These exchanges may occur at arbitrary intermediate stops such that our problem requires additional synchronization constraints. We present a mathematical model for this problem that leverages a time-expanded multi-digraph and derive bounds for the total number of required drivers. Moreover, we develop a destructive-bound-enhanced matheuristic that converges to provably optimal solutions and apply it to a real-world case study for Flixbus, one of Europe's leading coach companies. We demonstrate that our matheuristic outperforms a standalone MIP implementation in terms of solution quality and computational time and improves current approaches used in practice by up to 56%. Our solution approach provides feasible solutions for all instances within seconds and solves instances with up to 390 locations and 70 requests optimally with an average computational time under 210 seconds. We further study the impact of driver exchanges on personnel costs and show that allowing for such exchanges leads to savings of up to 75%."

In this paper, we analyze the popular spectral normalization scheme, find a significant drawback and introduce sparsity aware normalization (SAN), a new alternative approach for stabilizing GAN training. As opposed to other normalization methods, our approach explicitly accounts for the sparse nature of the feature maps in convolutional networks with ReLU activations. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments with a variety of network architectures. As we show, sparsity is particularly dominant in critics used for image-to-image translation settings. In these cases our approach improves upon existing methods, in less training epochs and with smaller capacity networks, while requiring practically no computational overhead."
833,aaai,2021,The Gap on Gap: Tackling the Problem of Differing Data Distributions in Bias-Measuring Datasets,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17557,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is quite challenging due to the large distribution discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain. Inspired by diffusion models which have strong capability to gradually convert data distributions across a large gap, we consider to explore the diffusion technique to handle the challenging UDA task. However, using diffusion models to convert data distribution across different domains is a non-trivial problem as the standard diffusion models generally perform conversion from the Gaussian distribution instead of from a specific domain distribution. Besides, during the conversion, the semantics of the source-domain data needs to be preserved for classification in the target domain. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Domain-Adaptive Diffusion (DAD) module accompanied by a Mutual Learning Strategy (MLS), which can gradually convert data distribution from the source domain to the target domain while enabling the classification model to learn along the domain transition process. Consequently, our method successfully eases the challenge of UDA by decomposing the large domain gap into small ones and gradually enhancing the capacity of classification model to finally adapt to the target domain. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-arts by a large margin on three widely used UDA datasets."

However, despite innovations in this area, deep learning models often struggle to match performance of shallow linear models in predicting these outcomes, making it difficult to leverage such techniques in practice. In this work, motivated by the task of clinical prediction from insurance claims, we present a new technique called Reverse Distillation which pretrains deep models by using high-performing linear models for initialization. We make use of the longitudinal structure of insurance claims datasets to develop Self Attention with Reverse Distillation, or SARD, an architecture that utilizes a combination of contextual embedding, temporal embedding and self-attention mechanisms and most critically is trained via reverse distillation. SARD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple clinical prediction outcomes, with ablation studies revealing that reverse distillation is a primary driver of these improvements.

835,aaai,2021,Disposable Linear Bandits for Online Recommendations,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16540,"Exposure bias is a well-known issue in recommender systems where items and suppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This is especially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few items (e.g., popular ones) are repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists and users' interactions with those items will amplify bias towards those items over time resulting in a feedback loop. This issue has been extensively studied in the literature on model-based or neighborhood-based recommendation algorithms, but less work has been done on online recommendation models, such as those based on top-K contextual bandits, where recommendation models are dynamically updated with ongoing user feedback. In this paper, we study exposure bias in a class of well-known contextual bandit algorithms known as Linear Cascading Bandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle exposure bias and provide a fair representation for items in the recommendation results. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms tend to amplify exposure disparity among items over time. In particular, we observe that these algorithms do not properly adapt to the feedback provided by the users and frequently recommend certain items even when those items are not selected by users. To mitigate this bias, we propose an Exposure-Aware (EA) reward model that updates the model parameters based on two factors: 1) user feedback (i.e., clicked or not), and 2) position of the item in the recommendation list. This way, the proposed model controls the utility assigned to items based on their exposure in the recommendation list. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets using three contextual bandit algorithms show that the proposed reward model reduces exposure bias amplification in long run while maintaining the recommendation accuracy."

In this work we address the more ambitious challenge of predicting the answers of conjunctive queries with multiple missing entities. We propose Bi-Directional Query Embedding (BIQE), a method that embeds conjunctive queries with models based on bi-directional attention mechanisms. Contrary to prior work, bidirectional self-attention can capture interactions among all the elements of a query graph. We introduce a new dataset for predicting the answer of conjunctive query and conduct experiments that show BIQE significantly outperforming state of the art baselines."

In this paper, we explore the relationship between followers sentiment towards the campaign topic and their rate of retweeting of messages generated by the campaign. Our analysis with followers of multiple social-media campaigns found statistical significant correlations between such sentiment and retweeting rate. Based on our analysis, we have conducted an online intervention study among the followers of different social-media campaigns.

In this paper we consider the rank-k binary matrix factorisation problem (k-BMF) under Boolean arithmetic: we are given an n x m binary matrix X with possibly missing entries and need to find two binary matrices A and B of dimension n x k and k x m respectively, which minimise the distance between X and the Boolean product of A and B in the squared Frobenius distance. We present a compact and two exponential size integer programs (IPs) for k-BMF and show that the compact IP has a weak LP relaxation, while the exponential size IPs have a stronger equivalent LP relaxation. We introduce a new objective function, which differs from the traditional squared Frobenius objective in attributing a weight to zero entries of the input matrix that is proportional to the number of times the zero is erroneously covered in a rank-k factorisation. For one of the exponential size IPs we describe a computational approach based on column generation. Experimental results on synthetic and real word datasets suggest that our integer programming approach is competitive against available methods for k-BMF and provides accurate low-error factorisations."

(Student Abstract),https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.17906,"The inherent intermittency of renewable sources like wind and solar has resulted in a bundling of renewable generators with storage resources (batteries) for increased reliability. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy sharing between two such bundles, each associated with their own demand profiles. The demand profiles might, for example, correspond to commitments made by the bundle to the grid. With each bundle seeking to minimize its loss of load rate, we explore the possibility that one bundle can supply energy to the other from its battery at times of deficit, in return for a reciprocal supply from the other when it faces a deficit itself. We show that there always exist \emph{mutually beneficial} energy sharing arrangements between the two bundles. Moreover, we show that Pareto-optimal arrangements involve at least one bundle transferring energy to the other at the maximum feasible rate at times of deficit. We illustrate the potential gains from such dynamic energy sharing via an extensive case study."
840,aaai,2021,Classification with Strategically Withheld Data,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16694,"Machine learning techniques can be useful in applications such as credit approval and college admission. However, to be classified more favorably in such contexts, an agent may decide to strategically withhold some of her features, such as bad test scores. This is a missing data problem with a twist: which data is missing {\em depends on the chosen classifier}, because the specific classifier is what may create the incentive to withhold certain feature values. We address the problem of training classifiers that are robust to this behavior.   We design three classification methods: {\sc Mincut}, {\sc Hill-Climbing} ({\sc HC}) and Incentive-Compatible Logistic Regression ({\sc IC-LR}). We show that {\sc Mincut} is optimal when the true distribution of data is fully known. However, it can produce complex decision boundaries, and hence be prone to overfitting in some cases. Based on a characterization of truthful classifiers (i.e., those that give no incentive to strategically hide features), we devise a simpler alternative called {\sc HC} which consists of a hierarchical ensemble of out-of-the-box classifiers, trained using a specialized hill-climbing procedure which we show to be convergent. For several reasons, {\sc Mincut} and {\sc HC} are not effective in utilizing a large number of complementarily informative features. To this end, we present {\sc IC-LR}, a modification of Logistic Regression that removes the incentive to strategically drop features. We also show that our algorithms perform well in experiments on real-world data sets, and present insights into their relative performance in different settings."

However, this domain still remains largely rule-driven and lacks universal automation. Recent developments in machine learning and in particular deep learning have opened the way to more general and efficient solutions to data-integration tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach that allows modeling and integrating entities by leveraging their relations and contextual information. This is achieved by combining siamese and graph neural networks to effectively propagate information between connected entities and support high scalability. We evaluated our approach on the task of integrating data about business entities, demonstrating that it outperforms both traditional rule-based systems and other deep learning approaches."

While such a transformation is invertible, its Jacobian is very sparse and thus may lack expressiveness. This work presents a simple remedy by noting that subdivision and (affine) coupling can be repeated recursively within the resulting subsets, leading to an efficiently invertible block with dense, triangular Jacobian. By formulating our recursive coupling scheme via a hierarchical architecture, HINT allows sampling from a joint distribution p(y,x) and the corresponding posterior p(x|y) using a single invertible network. We evaluate our method on some standard data sets and benchmark its full power for density estimation and Bayesian inference on a novel data set of 2D shapes in Fourier parameterization, which enables consistent visualization of samples for different dimensionalities."

While Bayesian hierarchical models are the current standard in the industry to estimate risk, interest in machine learning as a way to improve upon these existing methods is increasing. Lumiata, a healthcare analytics company, ran a study with a large health insurance company in the United States. We evaluated the ability of machine learning models to predict the per member per month cost of employer groups in their next renewal period, especially those groups who will cost less than 95\% of what an actuarial model predicts (groups with ""concession opportunities""). We developed a sequence of two models, an individual patient-level and an employer-group-level model, to predict the annual per member per month allowed amount for employer groups, based on a population of 14 million patients. Our models performed 20\% better than the insurance carrier's existing pricing model, and identified 84\% of the concession opportunities. This study demonstrates the application of a machine learning system to compute an accurate and fair price for health insurance products and analyzes how explainable machine learning models can exceed actuarial models' predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability."

A $\mathcal{C}$-BDMC sentence is a monotone circuit which satisfies decomposability property (such as in DNNF) in which the inputs (or leaves) are associated with CNF encodings from a given base class $\mathcal{C}$. We consider the class of propagation complete (PC) encodings as a base class and we show that PC-BDMCs are polynomially equivalent to PC encodings. Additionally, we use this to determine the properties of PC-BDMCs and PC encodings with respect to the knowledge compilation map including the list of efficient operations on the languages."

We improve the best approximation factor achieved by an algorithm that has optimal adaptivity and nearly optimal query complexity to $0.193 - \varepsilon$. The conference version of this work mistakenly employed a subroutine that does not work for non-monotone, submodular functions. In this version, we propose a fixed and improved subroutine to add a set with high average marginal gain, \threseq, which returns a solution in $O( \log(n) )$ adaptive rounds with high probability. Moreover, we provide two approximation algorithms. The first has approximation ratio $1/6 - \varepsilon$, adaptivity $O( \log (n) )$, and query complexity $O( n \log (k) )$, while the second has approximation ratio $0.193 - \varepsilon$, adaptivity $O( \log^2 (n) )$, and query complexity $O(n \log (k))$. Our algorithms are empirically validated to use a low number of adaptive rounds and total queries while obtaining solutions with high objective value in comparison with state-of-the-art approximation algorithms, including continuous algorithms that use the multilinear extension."
846,aaai,2021,On the PTAS for Maximin Shares in an Indivisible Mixed Manna,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16695,"In this paper we initiate the study of finding fair and efficient allocations of an indivisible mixed manna: Divide m indivisible items among n agents under the fairness notion of maximin share (MMS) and the efficiency notion of Pareto optimality (PO). A mixed manna allows an item to be a good for some agents and a chore for others. The problem of finding $\alpha$-MMS allocation for the (near) best $\alpha\in(0,1]$ for which it exists, remains unresolved even for a goods manna with constantly many agents, while the problem of finding $\alpha$-MMS+PO allocation is unexplored for any $\alpha\in(0,1]$.   We make significant progress on the above questions for a mixed manna. First, we show that for any $\alpha>0$, an $\alpha$-MMS allocation may not always exist, thus ruling out solving the problem for a fixed $\alpha$. Second, towards computing $\alpha$-MMS+PO allocation for the best possible $\alpha$, we obtain a dichotomous result: We derive two conditions and show that the problem is tractable under these two conditions, while dropping either renders the problem intractable. The two conditions are: (i) number of agents is a constant, and (ii) for every agent, her absolute value for all the items is at least a constant factor of her total (absolute) value for all the goods or all the chores.   In particular, first, for instances satisfying (i) and (ii) we design a PTAS - an efficient algorithm to find an $(\alpha-\epsilon)$-MMS and $\gamma$-PO allocation when given $\epsilon,\gamma>0$, for the highest possible $\alpha\in(0,1]$. Second, we show that if either condition is not satisfied then finding an $\alpha$-MMS allocation for any $\alpha\in(0,1]$ is NP-hard, even when a solution exists for $\alpha=1$. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first algorithm that ensures both approximate MMS and PO guarantees."

In this article, we develop a Long Short-Term memory based Recurrent Neural network model to predict intensity (in terms of maximum sustained surface wind speed), location (latitude and longitude), and time (in hours after the observation period) of the landfall of a tropical cyclone which originates in the North Indian ocean. The model takes as input the best track data of cyclone consisting of its location, pressure, sea surface temperature, and intensity for certain hours (from 12 to 36 hours) anytime during the course of the cyclone as a time series and then provide predictions with high accuracy. For example, using 24 hours data of a cyclone anytime during its course, the model provides state-of-the-art results by predicting landfall intensity, time, latitude, and longitude with a mean absolute error of 4.24 knots, 4.5 hours, 0.24 degree, and 0.37 degree respectively, which resulted in a distance error of 51.7 kilometers from the landfall location. We further check the efficacy of the model on three recent devastating cyclones Bulbul, Fani, and Gaja, and achieved better results than the test dataset."

This is the case for human driving and, thus, should be taken into account by systems providing any level of driving assistance, from advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) to fully autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we show how the latest advances on monocular vision-based human pose estimation, i.e. those relying on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), enable to recognize the intentions of such VRUs. In the case of cyclists, we assume that they follow traffic rules to indicate future maneuvers with arm signals. In the case of pedestrians, no indications can be assumed. Instead, we hypothesize that the walking pattern of a pedestrian allows to determine if he/she has the intention of crossing the road in the path of the ego-vehicle, so that the ego-vehicle must maneuver accordingly (e.g. slowing down or stopping). In this paper, we show how the same methodology can be used for recognizing pedestrians and cyclists' intentions. For pedestrians, we perform experiments on the JAAD dataset. For cyclists, we did not found an analogous dataset, thus, we created our own one by acquiring and annotating videos which we share with the research community. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides new state-of-the-art results on the intention recognition of VRUs."

This problem has been recently explored for visual SLAM, but to the best of our knowledge no work has been attempted to address DST for LiDAR scans. The problem is of critical importance due to wide-spread adoption of LiDAR in Autonomous Vehicles. We show that state-of the art methods developed for the visual domain when adapted for LiDAR scans perform poorly.   We develop DSLR, a deep generative model which learns a mapping between dynamic scan to its static counterpart through an adversarially trained autoencoder. Our model yields the first solution for DST on LiDAR that generates static scans without using explicit segmentation labels. DSLR cannot always be applied to real world data due to lack of paired dynamic-static scans. Using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, we propose DSLR-UDA for transfer to real world data and experimentally show that this performs well in real world settings. Additionally, if segmentation information is available, we extend DSLR to DSLR-Seg to further improve the reconstruction quality.   DSLR gives the state of the art performance on simulated and real-world datasets and also shows at least 4x improvement. We show that DSLR, unlike the existing baselines, is a practically viable model with its reconstruction quality within the tolerable limits for tasks pertaining to autonomous navigation like SLAM in dynamic environments."

However, for nonsmooth and nonconvex objectives, few convergence guarantees exist beyond cases where closed-form proximal operator solutions are available. As most popular contemporary deep neural networks lead to nonsmooth and nonconvex objectives, there is now a pressing need for such convergence guarantees. In this paper, we analyze for the first time the convergence of stochastic asynchronous optimization for this general class of objectives. In particular, we focus on stochastic subgradient methods allowing for block variable partitioning, where the shared-memory-based model is asynchronously updated by concurrent processes. To this end, we first introduce a probabilistic model which captures key features of real asynchronous scheduling between concurrent processes; under this model, we establish convergence with probability one to an invariant set for stochastic subgradient methods with momentum.   From the practical perspective, one issue with the family of methods we consider is that it is not efficiently supported by machine learning frameworks, as they mostly focus on distributed data-parallel strategies. To address this, we propose a new implementation strategy for shared-memory based training of deep neural networks, whereby concurrent parameter servers are utilized to train a partitioned but shared model in single- and multi-GPU settings. Based on this implementation, we achieve on average 1.2x speed-up in comparison to state-of-the-art training methods for popular image classification tasks without compromising accuracy."

The properties of Poisson likelihood allow a shortcut for very fast computations over zero-valued inputs, and oftentimes results in very sparse factors for both users and items.

Existing open corpora could not meet requirements for high-fidelity singing voice synthesis because of the scale and quality weaknesses. Previous vocoders have difficulty in multi-singer modeling, and a distinct degradation emerges when conducting unseen singer singing voice generation. To accelerate singing voice researches in the community, we release a large-scale, multi-singer Chinese singing voice dataset OpenSinger. To tackle the difficulty in unseen singer modeling, we propose Multi-Singer, a fast multi-singer vocoder with generative adversarial networks. Specifically, 1) Multi-Singer uses a multi-band generator to speed up both training and inference procedure. 2) to capture and rebuild singer identity from the acoustic feature (i.e., mel-spectrogram), Multi-Singer adopts a singer conditional discriminator and conditional adversarial training objective. 3) to supervise the reconstruction of singer identity in the spectrum envelopes in frequency domain, we propose an auxiliary singer perceptual loss. The joint training approach effectively works in GANs for multi-singer voices modeling. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of OpenSinger and show that Multi-Singer improves unseen singer singing voices modeling in both speed and quality over previous methods. The further experiment proves that combined with FastSpeech 2 as the acoustic model, Multi-Singer achieves strong robustness in the multi-singer singing voice synthesis pipeline.

It is suitable for many applications including object grasping, policy learning, etc. DONs map an RGB image depicting an object into a descriptor space image, which implicitly encodes key features of an object invariant to the relative camera pose. Impressively, the self-supervised training of DONs can be applied to arbitrary objects and can be evaluated and deployed within hours. However, the training approach relies on accurate depth images and faces challenges with small, reflective objects, typical for industrial settings, when using consumer grade depth cameras. In this paper we show that given a 3D model of an object, we can generate its descriptor space image, which allows for supervised training of DONs. We rely on Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) to embed the 3D model of an object into an optimally generated space. While our approach uses more domain knowledge, it can be efficiently applied even for smaller and reflective objects, as it does not rely on depth information. We compare the training methods on generating 6D grasps for industrial objects and show that our novel supervised training approach improves the pick-and-place performance in industry-relevant tasks."

The model produces new molecular structures from a single-node graph by recursively splitting every node into two. All operations are invertible and can be used as plug-and-play modules. The hierarchical nature of the latent codes allows for precise changes in the resulting graph: perturbations in the top layer cause global structural changes, while perturbations in the consequent layers change the resulting molecule marginally. The proposed model outperforms existing generative graph models on the distribution learning task. We also show successful experiments on global and constrained optimization of chemical properties using latent codes of the model."

In this work, we propose FastFourierSAT, a highly parallel hybrid SAT solver based on gradient-driven continuous local search (CLS). This is realized by a novel parallel algorithm inspired by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based convolution for computing the elementary symmetric polynomials (ESPs), which is the major computational task in previous CLS methods. The complexity of our algorithm matches the best previous result. Furthermore, the substantial parallelism inherent in our algorithm can leverage the GPU for acceleration, demonstrating significant improvement over the previous CLS approaches. We also propose to incorporate the restart heuristics in CLS to improve search efficiency. We compare our approach with the SOTA parallel SAT solvers on several benchmarks. Our results show that FastFourierSAT computes the gradient 100+ times faster than previous prototypes implemented on CPU. Moreover, FastFourierSAT solves most instances and demonstrates promising performance on larger-size instances."

Recently, machine learning algorithms have proven to be having enormous potential as a candidate for personal thermal comfort models. But, often within the normal settings of a building, personal thermal comfort data obtained via experiments are heavily class-imbalanced. There are a disproportionately high number of data samples for the ""Prefer No Change"" class, as compared with the ""Prefer Warmer"" and ""Prefer Cooler"" classes. Machine learning algorithms trained on such class-imbalanced data perform sub-optimally when deployed in the real world. To develop robust machine learning-based applications using the above class-imbalanced data, as well as for privacy-preserving data sharing, we propose to implement a state-of-the-art conditional synthetic data generator to generate synthetic data corresponding to the low-frequency classes. Via experiments, we show that the synthetic data generated has a distribution that mimics the real data distribution. The proposed method can be extended for use by other smart building datasets/use-cases."

We also presented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into DNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity. We present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an equivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a subclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the previous complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this stricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a new operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the assertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF twice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the entailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF under the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the significance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement linear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete belief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories."
859,aaai,2021,TODS: An Automated Time Series Outlier Detection System,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.18012,"Revenue management strongly relies on accurate forecasts. Thus, when extraordinary events cause outlier demand, revenue management systems need to recognise this and adapt both forecast and controls. Many passenger transport service providers, such as railways and airlines, control the sale of tickets through revenue management. State-of-the-art systems in these industries rely on analyst expertise to identify outlier demand both online (within the booking horizon) and offline (in hindsight). So far, little research focuses on automating and evaluating the detection of outlier demand in this context. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach, which detects outliers using functional data analysis in combination with time series extrapolation. We evaluate the approach in a simulation framework, which generates outliers by varying the demand model. The results show that functional outlier detection yields better detection rates than alternative approaches for both online and offline analyses. Depending on the category of outliers, extrapolation further increases online detection performance. We also apply the procedure to a set of empirical data to demonstrate its practical implications. By evaluating the full feedback-driven system of forecast and optimisation, we generate insight on the asymmetric effects of positive and negative demand outliers. We show that identifying instances of outlier demand and adjusting the forecast in a timely fashion substantially increases revenue compared to what is earned when ignoring outliers."

Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising and scalable framework for developing adaptive learning based solutions. Deep RL methods usually model the problem as a (Partially Observable) Markov Decision Process in which an agent acts in a stationary environment to learn an optimal behavior policy. However, driving involves complex interaction between multiple, intelligent (artificial or human) agents in a highly non-stationary environment. In this paper, we propose the use of Partially Observable Markov Games(POSG) for formulating the connected autonomous driving problems with realistic assumptions. We provide a taxonomy of multi-agent learning environments based on the nature of tasks, nature of agents and the nature of the environment to help in categorizing various autonomous driving problems that can be addressed under the proposed formulation.

However, the ubiquity of modern sensors allows us to collect large quantities of data from each of these complex systems and build accurate, nonlinear deep neural network models of their state transitions. But there remains one major problem for the task of control -- how can we plan with deep network learned transition models without resorting to Monte Carlo Tree Search and other black-box transition model techniques that ignore model structure and do not easily extend to mixed discrete and continuous domains? In this paper, we introduce two types of nonlinear planning methods that can leverage deep neural network learned transition models: Hybrid Deep MILP Planner (HD-MILP-Plan) and Tensorflow Planner (TF-Plan). In HD-MILP-Plan, we make the critical observation that the Rectified Linear Unit transfer function for deep networks not only allows faster convergence of model learning, but also permits a direct compilation of the deep network transition model to a Mixed-Integer Linear Program encoding. Further, we identify deep network specific optimizations for HD-MILP-Plan that improve performance over a base encoding and show that we can plan optimally with respect to the learned deep networks. In TF-Plan, we take advantage of the efficiency of auto-differentiation tools and GPU-based computation where we encode a subclass of purely continuous planning problems as Recurrent Neural Networks and directly optimize the actions through backpropagation. We compare both planners and show that TF-Plan is able to approximate the optimal plans found by HD-MILP-Plan in less computation time..."

However, the huge memory cost of deep CNN models poses a great challenge of deploying them on memory-constrained devices (e.g., mobile phones). One popular way to reduce the memory cost of deep CNN model is to train binary CNN where the weights in convolution filters are either 1 or -1 and therefore each weight can be efficiently stored using a single bit. However, the compression ratio of existing binary CNN models is upper bounded by around 32. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method to compress deep CNN model by stacking low-dimensional binary convolution filters. Our proposed method approximates a standard convolution filter by selecting and stacking filters from a set of low-dimensional binary convolution filters. This set of low-dimensional binary convolution filters is shared across all filters for a given convolution layer. Therefore, our method will achieve much larger compression ratio than binary CNN models. In order to train our proposed model, we have theoretically shown that our proposed model is equivalent to select and stack intermediate feature maps generated by low-dimensional binary filters. Therefore, our proposed model can be efficiently trained using the split-transform-merge strategy. We also provide detailed analysis of the memory and computation cost of our model in model inference. We compared the proposed method with other five popular model compression techniques on two benchmark datasets. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method achieves much higher compression ratio than existing methods while maintains comparable accuracy."

On the other hand, blockchain systems routinely perform a huge amount of computation that does not achieve practical purposes in order to build Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus from decentralized participants. In this paper, we propose a new consensus mechanism, Proof of Learning (PoLe), which directs the computation spent for consensus toward optimization of neural networks (NN). In our mechanism, the training/testing data are released to the entire blockchain network (BCN) and the consensus nodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. When the consensus on the BCN considers a NN model to be valid, a new block is appended to the blockchain. We experimentally compare the PoLe protocol with Proof of Work (PoW) and show that PoLe can achieve a more stable block generation rate, which leads to more efficient transaction processing. We also introduce a novel cheating prevention mechanism, Secure Mapping Layer (SML), which can be straightforwardly implemented as a linear NN layer. Empirical evaluation shows that SML can detect cheating nodes at small cost to the predictive performance."

But its applicability is limited by the reliance on annotated examples, which are difficult to produce at scale. Indirect supervision has emerged as a promising direction to address this bottleneck, either by introducing labeling functions to automatically generate noisy examples from unlabeled text, or by imposing constraints over interdependent label decisions. A plethora of methods have been proposed, each with respective strengths and limitations. Probabilistic logic offers a unifying language to represent indirect supervision, but end-to-end modeling with probabilistic logic is often infeasible due to intractable inference and learning. In this paper, we propose deep probabilistic logic (DPL) as a general framework for indirect supervision, by composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL models label decisions as latent variables, represents prior knowledge on their relations using weighted first-order logical formulas, and alternates between learning a deep neural network for the end task and refining uncertain formula weights for indirect supervision, using variational EM. This framework subsumes prior indirect supervision methods as special cases, and enables novel combination via infusion of rich domain and linguistic knowledge. Experiments on biomedical machine reading demonstrate the promise of this approach."

As a result of supervisor intervention, the executed action may differ from the action specified by the policy. How does this affect learning? We present the Modified-Action Markov Decision Process, an extension of the MDP model that allows actions to differ from the policy. We analyze the asymptotic behaviours of common reinforcement learning algorithms in this setting and show that they adapt in different ways: some completely ignore modifications while others go to various lengths in trying to avoid action modifications that decrease reward. By choosing the right algorithm, developers can prevent their agents from learning to circumvent interruptions or constraints, and better control agent responses to other kinds of action modification, like self-damage."

In contrast to the prevalent HTL and UDA approaches that typically use a single hypothesis, HDMI employs multiple hypotheses to leverage the underlying distributions of the source and target hypotheses. To better utilize the crucial relationship among different hypotheses -- as opposed to unconstrained optimization of each hypothesis independently -- while adapting to the unlabeled target domain through mutual information maximization, HDMI incorporates a hypothesis disparity regularization that coordinates the target hypotheses jointly learn better target representations while preserving more transferable source knowledge with better-calibrated prediction uncertainty. HDMI achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance on benchmark datasets for UDA in the context of HTL, without the need to access the source data during the adaptation."

The basic action in a gossip protocol is a pairwise message exchange (telephone call) wherein the calling agents exchange all the secrets they know. An agent who knows all secrets is an expert. The usual termination condition is that all agents are experts. Instead, we explore protocols wherein the termination condition is that all agents know that all agents are experts. We call such agents super experts. We also investigate gossip protocols that are common knowledge among the agents. Additionally, we model that agents who are super experts do not make and do not answer calls, and that this is common knowledge. We investigate conditions under which protocols terminate, both in the synchronous case, where there is a global clock, and in the asynchronous case, where there is not. We show that a commonly known protocol with engaged agents may terminate faster than the same commonly known protocol without engaged agents."
870,aaai,2021,Learning Continuous High-Dimensional Models using Mutual Information and Copula Bayesian Networks,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17441,"One of the main challenges in current systems neuroscience is the analysis of high-dimensional neuronal and behavioral data that are characterized by different statistics and timescales of the recorded variables. We propose a parametric copula model which separates the statistics of the individual variables from their dependence structure, and escapes the curse of dimensionality by using vine copula constructions. We use a Bayesian framework with Gaussian Process (GP) priors over copula parameters, conditioned on a continuous task-related variable. We validate the model on synthetic data and compare its performance in estimating mutual information against the commonly used non-parametric algorithms.   Our model provides accurate information estimates when the dependencies in the data match the parametric copulas used in our framework. When the exact density estimation with a parametric model is not possible, our Copula-GP model is still able to provide reasonable information estimates, close to the ground truth and comparable to those obtained with a neural network estimator. Finally, we apply our framework to real neuronal and behavioral recordings obtained in awake mice. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to   1) produce accurate and interpretable bivariate models for the analysis of inter-neuronal noise correlations or behavioral modulations;   2) expand to more than 100 dimensions and measure information content in the whole-population statistics. These results demonstrate that the Copula-GP framework is particularly useful for the analysis of complex multidimensional relationships between neuronal, sensory and behavioral data."
871,aaai,2021,Explaining Neural Matrix Factorization with Gradient Rollback,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16632,"Explaining the predictions of neural black-box models is an important problem, especially when such models are used in applications where user trust is crucial. Estimating the influence of training examples on a learned neural model's behavior allows us to identify training examples most responsible for a given prediction and, therefore, to faithfully explain the output of a black-box model. The most generally applicable existing method is based on influence functions, which scale poorly for larger sample sizes and models.   We propose gradient rollback, a general approach for influence estimation, applicable to neural models where each parameter update step during gradient descent touches a smaller number of parameters, even if the overall number of parameters is large. Neural matrix factorization models trained with gradient descent are part of this model class. These models are popular and have found a wide range of applications in industry. Especially knowledge graph embedding methods, which belong to this class, are used extensively. We show that gradient rollback is highly efficient at both training and test time. Moreover, we show theoretically that the difference between gradient rollback's influence approximation and the true influence on a model's behavior is smaller than known bounds on the stability of stochastic gradient descent. This establishes that gradient rollback is robustly estimating example influence. We also conduct experiments which show that gradient rollback provides faithful explanations for knowledge base completion and recommender datasets."
872,aaai,2021,Parallel Constraint Acquisition,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16504,"Purpose: To propose a wave-encoded model-based deep learning (wave-MoDL) strategy for highly accelerated 3D imaging and joint multi-contrast image reconstruction, and further extend this to enable rapid quantitative imaging using an interleaved look-locker acquisition sequence with T2 preparation pulse (3D-QALAS).   Method: Recently introduced MoDL technique successfully incorporates convolutional neural network (CNN)-based regularizers into physics-based parallel imaging reconstruction using a small number of network parameters. Wave-CAIPI is an emerging parallel imaging method that accelerates the imaging speed by employing sinusoidal gradients in the phase- and slice-encoding directions during the readout to take better advantage of 3D coil sensitivity profiles. In wave-MoDL, we propose to combine the wave-encoding strategy with unrolled network constraints to accelerate the acquisition speed while enforcing wave-encoded data consistency. We further extend wave-MoDL to reconstruct multi-contrast data with controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI) sampling patterns to leverage similarity between multiple images to improve the reconstruction quality.   Result: Wave-MoDL enables a 47-second MPRAGE acquisition at 1 mm resolution at 16-fold acceleration. For quantitative imaging, wave-MoDL permits a 2-minute acquisition for T1, T2, and proton density mapping at 1 mm resolution at 12-fold acceleration, from which contrast weighted images can be synthesized as well.   Conclusion: Wave-MoDL allows rapid MR acquisition and high-fidelity image reconstruction and may facilitate clinical and neuroscientific applications by incorporating unrolled neural networks into wave-CAIPI reconstruction."

However, when using undirected PGMS with hidden variables, two sources of error typically compound in all but the simplest models (a) learning error (both computing the partition function and integrating out the hidden variables is intractable); and (b) prediction error (exact inference is also intractable). Here we introduce query training (QT), a mechanism to learn a PGM that is optimized for the approximate inference algorithm that will be paired with it. The resulting PGM is a worse model of the data (as measured by the likelihood), but it is tuned to produce better marginals for a given inference algorithm. Unlike prior works, our approach preserves the querying flexibility of the original PGM: at test time, we can estimate the marginal of any variable given any partial evidence. We demonstrate experimentally that QT can be used to learn a challenging 8-connected grid Markov random field with hidden variables and that it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art AdVIL when tested on three undirected models across multiple datasets."

To promote the new task of camouflaged instance segmentation of in-the-wild images, we introduce a dataset, dubbed CAMO++, that extends our preliminary CAMO dataset (camouflaged object segmentation) in terms of quantity and diversity. The new dataset substantially increases the number of images with hierarchical pixel-wise ground truths. We also provide a benchmark suite for the task of camouflaged instance segmentation. In particular, we present an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods on our newly constructed CAMO++ dataset in various scenarios. We also present a camouflage fusion learning (CFL) framework for camouflaged instance segmentation to further improve the performance of state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we introduce ScribbleBox, a novel interactive framework for annotating object instances with masks in videos. In particular, we split annotation into two steps: annotating objects with tracked boxes, and labeling masks inside these tracks. We introduce automation and interaction in both steps. Box tracks are annotated efficiently by approximating the trajectory using a parametric curve with a small number of control points which the annotator can interactively correct. Our approach tolerates a modest amount of noise in the box placements, thus typically only a few clicks are needed to annotate tracked boxes to a sufficient accuracy. Segmentation masks are corrected via scribbles which are efficiently propagated through time. We show significant performance gains in annotation efficiency over past work. We show that our ScribbleBox approach reaches 88.92% J&F on DAVIS2017 with 9.14 clicks per box track, and 4 frames of scribble annotation."

However, there is little theoretical explanation for the success of neural networks beyond the supervised setting. In this paper we argue that, under some distributional assumptions, classical learning-theoretic measures can sufficiently explain generalization for graph neural networks in the transductive setting. In particular, we provide a rigorous analysis of the performance of neural networks in the context of transductive inference, specifically by analysing the generalisation properties of graph convolutional networks for the problem of node classification. While VC Dimension does result in trivial generalisation error bounds in this setting as well, we show that transductive Rademacher complexity can explain the generalisation properties of graph convolutional networks for stochastic block models. We further use the generalisation error bounds based on transductive Rademacher complexity to demonstrate the role of graph convolutions and network architectures in achieving smaller generalisation error and provide insights into when the graph structure can help in learning. The findings of this paper could re-new the interest in studying generalisation in neural networks in terms of learning-theoretic measures, albeit in specific problems."

A contour is a circular sequence of points representing a closed shape. For handling the cyclical property of the contour representation, we employ circular convolution layers. Contours are often represented sparsely. To address information sparsity, we introduce priority pooling layers that select features based on their magnitudes. Priority pooling layers pool features with low magnitudes while leaving the rest unchanged. We evaluated the proposed model using letters and digits shapes extracted from the EMNIST dataset and obtained a high classification accuracy."

The method comprises two steps. First, the method computes a low-dimensional embedding of the high-dimensional dynamical-system state using deep convolutional autoencoders. This defines a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold on which the state is subsequently enforced to evolve. Second, the method defines a latent-dynamics model that associates with the solution to a constrained optimization problem. Here, the objective function is defined as the sum of squares of conservation-law violations over control volumes within a finite-volume discretization of the problem; nonlinear equality constraints explicitly enforce conservation over prescribed subdomains of the problem. Under modest conditions, the resulting dynamics model guarantees that the time-evolution of the latent state exactly satisfies conservation laws over the prescribed subdomains."

However, few studies consider abnormal situations that a visual question answering (VQA) model might encounter at test time after deployment in the real-world. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art VQA models to five different anomalies, including worst-case scenarios, the most frequent scenarios, and the current limitation of VQA models. Different from the results in unimodal tasks, the maximum confidence of answers in VQA models cannot detect anomalous inputs, and post-training of the outputs, such as outlier exposure, is ineffective for VQA models. Thus, we propose an attention-based method, which uses confidence of reasoning between input images and questions and shows much more promising results than the previous methods in unimodal tasks. In addition, we show that a maximum entropy regularization of attention networks can significantly improve the attention-based anomaly detection of the VQA models. Thanks to the simplicity, attention-based anomaly detection and the regularization are model-agnostic methods, which can be used for various cross-modal attentions in the state-of-the-art VQA models. The results imply that cross-modal attention in VQA is important to improve not only VQA accuracy, but also the robustness to various anomalies."

We propose an inexpensive, scalable, and interpretable approach to predict key livelihood indicators from public crowd-sourced street-level imagery. Such imagery can be cheaply collected and more frequently updated compared to traditional surveying methods, while containing plausibly relevant information for a range of livelihood indicators. We propose two approaches to learn from the street-level imagery: (1) a method that creates multi-household cluster representations by detecting informative objects and (2) a graph-based approach that captures the relationships between images. By visualizing what features are important to a model and how they are used, we can help end-user organizations understand the models and offer an alternate approach for index estimation that uses cheaply obtained roadway features. By comparing our results against ground data collected in nationally-representative household surveys, we demonstrate the performance of our approach in accurately predicting indicators of poverty, population, and health and its scalability by testing in two different countries, India and Kenya.

883,aaai,2021,Learning Monocular Depth in Dynamic Scenes via Instance-Aware Projection Consistency,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i3.16281,"Self-supervised monocular depth estimation enables robots to learn 3D perception from raw video streams. This scalable approach leverages projective geometry and ego-motion to learn via view synthesis, assuming the world is mostly static. Dynamic scenes, which are common in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction, violate this assumption. Therefore, they require modeling dynamic objects explicitly, for instance via estimating pixel-wise 3D motion, i.e. scene flow. However, the simultaneous self-supervised learning of depth and scene flow is ill-posed, as there are infinitely many combinations that result in the same 3D point. In this paper we propose DRAFT, a new method capable of jointly learning depth, optical flow, and scene flow by combining synthetic data with geometric self-supervision. Building upon the RAFT architecture, we learn optical flow as an intermediate task to bootstrap depth and scene flow learning via triangulation. Our algorithm also leverages temporal and geometric consistency losses across tasks to improve multi-task learning. Our DRAFT architecture simultaneously establishes a new state of the art in all three tasks in the self-supervised monocular setting on the standard KITTI benchmark.

SSAT, however, is limited by its descriptive power within the PSPACE complexity class. More complex problems, such as the NEXPTIME-complete Decentralized POMDP (Dec-POMDP), cannot be succinctly encoded with SSAT. To provide a logical formalism of such problems, we extend the Dependency Quantified Boolean Formula (DQBF), a representative problem in the NEXPTIME-complete class, to its stochastic variant, named Dependency SSAT (DSSAT), and show that DSSAT is also NEXPTIME-complete. We demonstrate the potential applications of DSSAT to circuit synthesis of probabilistic and approximate design. Furthermore, to study the descriptive power of DSSAT, we establish a polynomial-time reduction from Dec-POMDP to DSSAT. With the theoretical foundations paved in this work, we hope to encourage the development of DSSAT solvers for potential broad applications."
885,aaai,2021,SALNet: Semi-supervised Few-Shot Text Classification with Attention-based Lexicon Construction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i14.17558,"Increasing attention has been drawn to the sentiment analysis of financial documents. The most popular examples of such documents include analyst reports and economic news, the analysis of which is frequently used to capture the trends in market sentiments. On the other hand, the significance of the role sentiment analysis plays in the financial domain has given rise to the efforts to construct a financial domain-specific sentiment lexicon. Sentiment lexicons lend a hand for solving various text mining tasks, such as unsupervised classification of text data, while alleviating the arduous human labor required for manual labeling. One of the challenges in the construction of an effective sentiment lexicon is that the semantic orientation of a word may change depending on the context in which it appears. For instance, the word ``profit"" usually conveys positive sentiments; however, when the word is juxtaposed with another word ``decrease,"" the sentiment associated with the phrase ``profit decreases"" now becomes negative. Hence, the sentiment of a given word may shift as one begins to consider the context surrounding the word. In this paper, we address this issue by incorporating context when building sentiment lexicon from a given corpus. Specifically, we construct a lexicon named Senti-DD for the Sentiment lexicon composed of Direction-Dependent words, which expresses each term a pair of a directional word and a direction-dependent word. Experiment results show that higher classification performance is achieved with Senti-DD, proving the effectiveness of our method for automatically constructing a context-aware sentiment lexicon in the financial domain."
886,aaai,2021,Patch-Wise Attention Network for Monocular Depth Estimation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i3.16282,"Monocular depth estimation is very challenging because clues to the exact depth are incomplete in a single RGB image. To overcome the limitation, deep neural networks rely on various visual hints such as size, shade, and texture extracted from RGB information. However, we observe that if such hints are overly exploited, the network can be biased on RGB information without considering the comprehensive view. We propose a novel depth estimation model named RElative Depth Transformer (RED-T) that uses relative depth as guidance in self-attention. Specifically, the model assigns high attention weights to pixels of close depth and low attention weights to pixels of distant depth. As a result, the features of similar depth can become more likely to each other and thus less prone to misused visual hints. We show that the proposed model achieves competitive results in monocular depth estimation benchmarks and is less biased to RGB information. In addition, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation benchmark that limits the observable depth range during training in order to evaluate the robustness of the model for unseen depths."

Recent studies on time series classification show that convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved the state-of-the-art performance as a single classifier. In this work, pointing out that the global pooling layer that is usually adopted by existing CNN classifiers discards the temporal information of high-level features, we present a dynamic temporal pooling (DTP) technique that reduces the temporal size of hidden representations by aggregating the features at the segment-level. For the partition of a whole series into multiple segments, we utilize dynamic time warping (DTW) to align each time point in a temporal order with the prototypical features of the segments, which can be optimized simultaneously with the network parameters of CNN classifiers. The DTP layer combined with a fully-connected layer helps to extract further discriminative features considering their temporal position within an input time series. Extensive experiments on both univariate and multivariate time series datasets show that our proposed pooling significantly improves the classification performance."

Although neural networks have a clear purpose of embedding datasets into the low-dimensional space, the existing knowledge was quite far from this purpose and provided only limited information. We argue that good knowledge should be able to interpret the embedding procedure. This paper proposes a method of generating interpretable embedding procedure (IEP) knowledge based on principal component analysis, and distilling it based on a message passing neural network. Experimental results show that the student network trained by the proposed KD method improves 2.28% in the CIFAR100 dataset, which is higher performance than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method.

However, existing TAL methods are rooted in the closed set assumption, which cannot handle the inevitable unknown actions in open-world scenarios. In this paper, we, for the first time, step toward the Open Set TAL (OSTAL) problem and propose a general framework OpenTAL based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). Specifically, the OpenTAL consists of uncertainty-aware action classification, actionness prediction, and temporal location regression. With the proposed importance-balanced EDL method, classification uncertainty is learned by collecting categorical evidence majorly from important samples. To distinguish the unknown actions from background video frames, the actionness is learned by the positive-unlabeled learning. The classification uncertainty is further calibrated by leveraging the guidance from the temporal localization quality. The OpenTAL is general to enable existing TAL models for open set scenarios, and experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.

Because adversarial feedback alone is not sufficient to train the generator, current models still require the reconstruction loss compared with the ground-truth and the generated mel-spectrogram directly. In this paper, we present Multi-SpectroGAN (MSG), which can train the multi-speaker model with only the adversarial feedback by conditioning a self-supervised hidden representation of the generator to a conditional discriminator. This leads to better guidance for generator training. Moreover, we also propose adversarial style combination (ASC) for better generalization in the unseen speaking style and transcript, which can learn latent representations of the combined style embedding from multiple mel-spectrograms. Trained with ASC and feature matching, the MSG synthesizes a high-diversity mel-spectrogram by controlling and mixing the individual speaking styles (e.g., duration, pitch, and energy). The result shows that the MSG synthesizes a high-fidelity mel-spectrogram, which has almost the same naturalness MOS score as the ground-truth mel-spectrogram."

However, the memory and computation costs of kernel approximation models are still too high if we want to deploy them on memory-limited devices such as mobile phones, smartwatches, and IoT devices. To address this challenge, we propose a novel memory and computation-efficient kernel SVM model by using both binary embedding and binary model coefficients. First, we propose an efficient way to generate compact binary embedding of the data, preserving the kernel similarity. Second, we propose a simple but effective algorithm to learn a linear classification model with ternary coefficients that can support different types of loss function and regularizer. Our algorithm can achieve better generalization accuracy than existing works on learning binary coefficients since we allow coefficient to be $-1$, $0$, or $1$ during the training stage, and coefficient $0$ can be removed during model inference for binary classification. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the convergence of our algorithm and the inference complexity of our model. The analysis shows that the convergence to a local optimum is guaranteed, and the inference complexity of our model is much lower than other competing methods. Our experimental results on five large real-world datasets have demonstrated that our proposed method can build accurate nonlinear SVM models with memory costs less than 30KB."

We conducted an empirical study of 23,485 games on the Steam platform to analyze how often, and which games delayed their release date. We find that delaying a release is common: 48% of the studied games had a delayed initial release. Games delayed their release by a median of 14 days. Games for which a release date range (e.g., ""Q1 2019"") was specified, rather than a specific date were more likely to release within that range. Across different game genres, the percentage of games that delay release is similar (ranging from 48% to 52%). Finally, games with a delayed release are rated lower than games that release on time, but the difference is negligible."

During the next unsupervised stage edge nets are trained on the pseudo-ground truth provided by consensus among multiple paths that reach the nets' start and end nodes. These paths act as ensemble teachers for any given edge and strong consensus is used for high-confidence supervisory signal. The unsupervised learning process is repeated over several generations, in which each edge becomes a ""student"" and also part of different ensemble ""teachers"" for training other students. By optimizing such consensus between different paths, the graph reaches consistency and robustness over multiple interpretations and generations, in the face of unknown labels. We give theoretical justifications of the proposed idea and validate it on a large dataset. We show how prediction of different representations such as depth, semantic segmentation, surface normals and pose from RGB input could be effectively learned through self-supervised consensus in our graph. We also compare to state-of-the-art methods for multi-task and semi-supervised learning and show superior performance."

We consider locality-constrained linear and subspace-based manifolds, and locality-constrained non-linear manifolds. In our design, the manifold learning and coding steps are intertwined with layers of the discriminator, with the goal of attracting intermediate feature representations onto manifolds. We adaptively balance the discrepancy between feature representations and their manifold view, which is a trade-off between denoising on the manifold and refining the manifold. We find that locality-constrained non-linear manifolds outperform linear manifolds due to their non-uniform density and smoothness. We also substantially outperform state-of-the-art baselines."
898,aaai,2021,Rejection Sampling for Weighted Jaccard Similarity Revisited,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16543,"Min-Hash is a popular technique for efficiently estimating the Jaccard similarity of binary sets. Consistent Weighted Sampling (CWS) generalizes the Min-Hash scheme to sketch weighted sets and has drawn increasing interest from the community. Due to its constant-time complexity independent of the values of the weights, Improved CWS (ICWS) is considered as the state-of-the-art CWS algorithm. In this paper, we revisit ICWS and analyze its underlying mechanism to show that there actually exists dependence between the two components of the hash-code produced by ICWS, which violates the condition of independence. To remedy the problem, we propose an Improved ICWS (I$^2$CWS) algorithm which not only shares the same theoretical computational complexity as ICWS but also abides by the required conditions of the CWS scheme. The experimental results on a number of synthetic data sets and real-world text data sets demonstrate that our I$^2$CWS algorithm can estimate the Jaccard similarity more accurately, and also compete with or outperform the compared methods, including ICWS, in classification and top-$K$ retrieval, after relieving the underlying dependence."
899,aaai,2021,Contrastive Clustering,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17037,"Attributed graph clustering, which learns node representation from node attribute and topological graph for clustering, is a fundamental but challenging task for graph analysis. Recently, methods based on graph contrastive learning (GCL) have obtained impressive clustering performance on this task. Yet, we observe that existing GCL-based methods 1) fail to benefit from imprecise clustering labels; 2) require a post-processing operation to get clustering labels; 3) cannot solve out-of-sample (OOS) problem. To address these issues, we propose a novel attributed graph clustering network, namely Self-supervised Contrastive Attributed Graph Clustering (SCAGC). In SCAGC, by leveraging inaccurate clustering labels, a self-supervised contrastive loss, which aims to maximize the similarities of intra-cluster nodes while minimizing the similarities of inter-cluster nodes, are designed for node representation learning. Meanwhile, a clustering module is built to directly output clustering labels by contrasting the representation of different clusters. Thus, for the OOS nodes, SCAGC can directly calculate their clustering labels. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets have shown that SCAGC consistently outperforms 11 competitive clustering methods."

Producers can obtain more traffic and profits, and readers can have access to outstanding articles. When generating attractive headlines, it is important to not only capture the attractive content but also follow an eye-catching written style. In this paper, we propose a Disentanglement-based Attractive Headline Generator (DAHG) that generates headline which captures the attractive content following the attractive style. Concretely, we first devise a disentanglement module to divide the style and content of an attractive prototype headline into latent spaces, with two auxiliary constraints to ensure the two spaces are indeed disentangled. The latent content information is then used to further polish the document representation and help capture the salient part. Finally, the generator takes the polished document as input to generate headline under the guidance of the attractive style. Extensive experiments on the public Kuaibao dataset show that DAHG achieves state-of-the-art performance. Human evaluation also demonstrates that DAHG triggers 22% more clicks than existing models."

In such scenarios, the ability to accurately simulate the vehicle sensors such as cameras, lidar or radar is essential. However, current sensor simulators leverage gaming engines such as Unreal or Unity, requiring manual creation of environments, objects and material properties. Such approaches have limited scalability and fail to produce realistic approximations of camera, lidar, and radar data without significant additional work.   In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach to generate realistic scenario sensor data, based only on a limited amount of lidar and camera data collected by an autonomous vehicle. Our approach uses texture-mapped surfels to efficiently reconstruct the scene from an initial vehicle pass or set of passes, preserving rich information about object 3D geometry and appearance, as well as the scene conditions. We then leverage a SurfelGAN network to reconstruct realistic camera images for novel positions and orientations of the self-driving vehicle and moving objects in the scene. We demonstrate our approach on the Waymo Open Dataset and show that it can synthesize realistic camera data for simulated scenarios. We also create a novel dataset that contains cases in which two self-driving vehicles observe the same scene at the same time. We use this dataset to provide additional evaluation and demonstrate the usefulness of our SurfelGAN model."

The applications of this field ranges from generating highlight videos in sports, to intelligent surveillance and gesture recognition. Most activity recognition systems rely on a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform feature extraction from the data and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to determine the time dependent nature of the data. This paper proposes and designs two transformer neural networks for human activity recognition: a recurrent transformer (ReT), a specialized neural network used to make predictions on sequences of data, as well as a vision transformer (ViT), a transformer optimized for extracting salient features from images, to improve speed and scalability of activity recognition. We have provided an extensive comparison of the proposed transformer neural networks with the contemporary CNN and RNN-based human activity recognition models in terms of speed and accuracy."

Feature extraction is a main step in classification tasks. Traditional approaches employ hand-crafted features for classification while convolutional neural networks (CNN) are able to extract features automatically. In this paper, we use dilated convolutional neural network for multivariate time series classification. To deploy dilated CNN, a multivariate time series is transformed into an image-like style and stacks of dilated and strided convolutions are applied to extract in and between features of variates in time series simultaneously. We evaluate our model on two human activity recognition time series, finding that the automatic features extracted for the time series can be as effective as hand-crafted features."
904,aaai,2021,A Free Lunch for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Object Detection without Source Data,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17029,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) assumes that source and target domain data are freely available and usually trained together to reduce the domain gap. However, considering the data privacy and the inefficiency of data transmission, it is impractical in real scenarios. Hence, it draws our eyes to optimize the network in the target domain without accessing labeled source data. To explore this direction in object detection, for the first time, we propose a source data-free domain adaptive object detection (SFOD) framework via modeling it into a problem of learning with noisy labels. Generally, a straightforward method is to leverage the pre-trained network from the source domain to generate the pseudo labels for target domain optimization. However, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of pseudo labels since no labels are available in target domain. In this paper, self-entropy descent (SED) is a metric proposed to search an appropriate confidence threshold for reliable pseudo label generation without using any handcrafted labels. Nonetheless, completely clean labels are still unattainable. After a thorough experimental analysis, false negatives are found to dominate in the generated noisy labels. Undoubtedly, false negatives mining is helpful for performance improvement, and we ease it to false negatives simulation through data augmentation like Mosaic. Extensive experiments conducted in four representative adaptation tasks have demonstrated that the proposed framework can easily achieve state-of-the-art performance. From another view, it also reminds the UDA community that the labeled source data are not fully exploited in the existing methods."
905,aaai,2021,Dec-SGTS: Decentralized Sub-Goal Tree Search for Multi-Agent Coordination,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17345,"We present the Learning for KinoDynamic Tree Expansion (L4KDE) method for kinodynamic planning. Tree-based planning approaches, such as rapidly exploring random tree (RRT), are the dominant approach to finding globally optimal plans in continuous state-space motion planning. Central to these approaches is tree-expansion, the procedure in which new nodes are added into an ever-expanding tree. We study the kinodynamic variants of tree-based planning, where we have known system dynamics and kinematic constraints. In the interest of quickly selecting nodes to connect newly sampled coordinates, existing methods typically cannot optimise to find nodes that have low cost to transition to sampled coordinates. Instead, they use metrics like Euclidean distance between coordinates as a heuristic for selecting candidate nodes to connect to the search tree. We propose L4KDE to address this issue. L4KDE uses a neural network to predict transition costs between queried states, which can be efficiently computed in batch, providing much higher quality estimates of transition cost compared to commonly used heuristics while maintaining almost-surely asymptotic optimality guarantee. We empirically demonstrate the significant performance improvement provided by L4KDE on a variety of challenging system dynamics, with the ability to generalise across different instances of the same model class, and in conjunction with a suite of modern tree-based motion planners."
906,aaai,2021,TRQ: Ternary Neural Networks With Residual Quantization,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17036,"Due to a resource-constrained environment, network compression has become an important part of deep neural networks research. In this paper, we propose a new compression method, \textit{Inter-Layer Weight Prediction} (ILWP) and quantization method which quantize the predicted residuals between the weights in all convolution layers based on an inter-frame prediction method in conventional video coding schemes. Furthermore, we found a phenomenon \textit{Smoothly Varying Weight Hypothesis} (SVWH) which is that the weights in adjacent convolution layers share strong similarity in shapes and values, i.e., the weights tend to vary smoothly along with the layers. Based on SVWH, we propose a second ILWP and quantization method which quantize the predicted residuals between the weights in adjacent convolution layers. Since the predicted weight residuals tend to follow Laplace distributions with very low variance, the weight quantization can more effectively be applied, thus producing more zero weights and enhancing the weight compression ratio. In addition, we propose a new \textit{inter-layer loss} for eliminating non-texture bits, which enabled us to more effectively store only texture bits. That is, the proposed loss regularizes the weights such that the collocated weights between the adjacent two layers have the same values. Finally, we propose an ILWP with an inter-layer loss and quantization method. Our comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a much higher weight compression rate at the same accuracy level compared with the previous quantization-based compression methods in deep neural networks."
907,aaai,2021,Online Optimal Control with Affine Constraints,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17035,"This paper addresses the problem of safety-critical control for non-affine control systems. It has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs subject to state and control constraints can be sub-optimally reduced to a sequence of quadratic programs (QPs) by using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Our recently proposed High Order CBFs (HOCBFs) can accommodate constraints of arbitrary relative degree. The main challenges in this approach are that it requires affine control dynamics and the solution of the CBF-based QP is sub-optimal since it is solved point-wise. To address these challenges, we incorporate higher-order CBFs into neural ordinary differential equation-based learning models as differentiable CBFs to guarantee safety for non-affine control systems. The differentiable CBFs are trainable in terms of their parameters, and thus, they can address the conservativeness of CBFs such that the system state will not stay unnecessarily far away from safe set boundaries. Moreover, the imitation learning model is capable of learning complex and optimal control policies that are usually intractable online. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on LiDAR-based autonomous driving and compare it with existing methods."

In this paper, we propose Greedy Bandits with Sampled Context (GB-SC), a method for contextual multi-armed bandits to develop the prior from the context information using Thompson Sampling, and arm selection using an epsilon-greedy policy. The framework GB-SC allows for evaluation of context-reward dependency, as well as providing robustness for partially observable context vectors by leveraging the prior developed. Our experimental results show competitive performance on the Mushroom environment in terms of expected regret and expected cumulative regret, as well as insights on how each context subset affects decision-making."

We propose an approach which instead estimates a distribution by fitting the value function with a Bayesian Neural Network. We optimize an $\alpha$-divergence objective with Bayesian dropout approximation to learn and estimate this distribution. We show that using the Monte Carlo posterior mean of the Bayesian value function distribution, rather than a deterministic network, improves stability and performance of policy gradient methods in continuous control MuJoCo simulations."

Hashing aims to learn short binary codes for compact storage and efficient semantic retrieval. We propose an unsupervised deep hashing layer called Bi-half Net that maximizes entropy of the binary codes. Entropy is maximal when both possible values of the bit are uniformly (half-half) distributed. To maximize bit entropy, we do not add a term to the loss function as this is difficult to optimize and tune. Instead, we design a new parameter-free network layer to explicitly force continuous image features to approximate the optimal half-half bit distribution. This layer is shown to minimize a penalized term of the Wasserstein distance between the learned continuous image features and the optimal half-half bit distribution. Experimental results on the image datasets Flickr25k, Nus-wide, Cifar-10, Mscoco, Mnist and the video datasets Ucf-101 and Hmdb-51 show that our approach leads to compact codes and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art."
911,aaai,2021,Exploiting Learnable Joint Groups for Hand Pose Estimation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i3.16287,"In this paper, we propose to estimate 3D hand pose by recovering the 3D coordinates of joints in a group-wise manner, where less-related joints are automatically categorized into different groups and exhibit different features. This is different from the previous methods where all the joints are considered holistically and share the same feature. The benefits of our method are illustrated by the principle of multi-task learning (MTL), i.e., by separating less-related joints into different groups (as different tasks), our method learns different features for each of them, therefore efficiently avoids the negative transfer (among less related tasks/groups of joints). The key of our method is a novel binary selector that automatically selects related joints into the same group. We implement such a selector with binary values stochastically sampled from a Concrete distribution, which is constructed using Gumbel softmax on trainable parameters. This enables us to preserve the differentiable property of the whole network. We further exploit features from those less-related groups by carrying out an additional feature fusing scheme among them, to learn more discriminative features. This is realized by implementing multiple 1x1 convolutions on the concatenated features, where each joint group contains a unique 1x1 convolution for feature fusion. The detailed ablation analysis and the extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Besides, our method achieves top-1 among all the methods that do not exploit the dense 3D shape labels on the most recently released FreiHAND competition at the submission date.

Understanding human behavior is a cornerstone of observational practice, especially in psychotherapy. An important cue of behavior analysis is the dynamical changes of emotions during the conversation. Domain experts integrate emotional information in a highly nonlinear manner, thus, it is challenging to explicitly quantify the relationship between emotions and behaviors. In this work, we employ deep transfer learning to analyze their inferential capacity and contextual importance. We first train a network to quantify emotions from acoustic signals and then use information from the emotion recognition network as features for behavior recognition. We treat this emotion-related information as behavioral primitives and further train higher level layers towards behavior quantification. Through our analysis, we find that emotion-related information is an important cue for behavior recognition. Further, we investigate the importance of emotional-context in the expression of behavior by constraining (or not) the neural networks' contextual view of the data. This demonstrates that the sequence of emotions is critical in behavior expression. To achieve these frameworks we employ hybrid architectures of convolutional networks and recurrent networks to extract emotion-related behavior primitives and facilitate automatic behavior recognition from speech."

Many current methods adopt the ""localization by classification"" framework: first do video classification, then locate temporal area contributing to the results most. However, this framework fails to locate the entire action instances and gives little consideration to the local context. In this paper, we present a novel architecture called Cascaded Pyramid Mining Network (CPMN) to address these issues using two effective modules. First, to discover the entire temporal interval of specific action, we design a two-stage cascaded module with proposed Online Adversarial Erasing (OAE) mechanism, where new and complementary regions are mined through feeding the erased feature maps of discovered regions back to the system. Second, to exploit hierarchical contextual information in videos and reduce missing detections, we design a pyramid module which produces a scale-invariant attention map through combining the feature maps from different levels. Final, we aggregate the results of two modules to perform action localization via locating high score areas in temporal Class Activation Sequence (CAS). Extensive experiments conducted on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

While these methods achieve reasonable improvements in performance, they typically perform category-agnostic domain alignment, thereby resulting in negative transfer of features. To overcome this issue, in this work, we attempt to incorporate category information into the domain adaptation process by proposing Memory Guided Attention for Category-Aware Domain Adaptation (MeGA-CDA). The proposed method consists of employing category-wise discriminators to ensure category-aware feature alignment for learning domain-invariant discriminative features. However, since the category information is not available for the target samples, we propose to generate memory-guided category-specific attention maps which are then used to route the features appropriately to the corresponding category discriminator. The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and is shown to outperform existing approaches."

There has been a surge of research in deep learning models for WSI classification with clinical applications such as cancer detection or prediction of molecular mutations from WSIs. Most methods require expensive and labor-intensive manual annotations by expert pathologists. Weakly supervised Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have recently demonstrated excellent performance; however, they still require large slide-level labeled training datasets that need a careful inspection of each slide by an expert pathologist. In this work, we propose a fully unsupervised WSI classification algorithm based on mutual transformer learning. Instances from gigapixel WSI (i.e., image patches) are transformed into a latent space and then inverse-transformed to the original space. Using the transformation loss, pseudo-labels are generated and cleaned using a transformer label-cleaner. The proposed transformer-based pseudo-label generation and cleaning modules mutually train each other iteratively in an unsupervised manner. A discriminative learning mechanism is introduced to improve normal versus cancerous instance labeling. In addition to unsupervised classification, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for weak supervision for cancer subtype classification as downstream analysis. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show excellent performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

However, the general optical flow methods typically do not consider the target's 3D shape information during matching, making them less effective in 6D object pose estimation. In this work, we propose a shape-constraint recurrent matching framework for 6D object pose estimation. We first compute a pose-induced flow based on the displacement of 2D reprojection between the initial pose and the currently estimated pose, which embeds the target's 3D shape implicitly. Then we use this pose-induced flow to construct the correlation map for the following matching iterations, which reduces the matching space significantly and is much easier to learn. Furthermore, we use networks to learn the object pose based on the current estimated flow, which facilitates the computation of the pose-induced flow for the next iteration and yields an end-to-end system for object pose. Finally, we optimize the optical flow and object pose simultaneously in a recurrent manner. We evaluate our method on three challenging 6D object pose datasets and show that it outperforms the state of the art significantly in both accuracy and efficiency."

However, very low-quality inputs cannot offer accurate geometric prior while high-quality references are inaccessible, limiting the applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose GFP-GAN that leverages rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pretrained face GAN for blind face restoration. This Generative Facial Prior (GFP) is incorporated into the face restoration process via novel channel-split spatial feature transform layers, which allow our method to achieve a good balance of realness and fidelity. Thanks to the powerful generative facial prior and delicate designs, our GFP-GAN could jointly restore facial details and enhance colors with just a single forward pass, while GAN inversion methods require expensive image-specific optimization at inference. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance to prior art on both synthetic and real-world datasets."

As an emerging technique for characterization, Spatial Representation Learning (SRL) uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn non-linear embedded features of spatial data for characterization. However, SRL extracts features by internal layers of DNNs, and thus suffers from lacking semantic labels. Texts of spatial entities, on the other hand, provide semantic understanding of latent feature labels, but is insensible to deep SRL models. How can we teach a SRL model to discover appropriate topic labels in texts and pair learned features with the labels? This paper formulates a new problem: feature-topic pairing, and proposes a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based deep learning framework. Specifically, we formulate the feature-topic pairing problem into an automated alignment task between 1) a latent embedding feature space and 2) a textual semantic topic space. We decompose the alignment of the two spaces into: 1) point-wise alignment, denoting the correlation between a topic distribution and an embedding vector; 2) pair-wise alignment, denoting the consistency between a feature-feature similarity matrix and a topic-topic similarity matrix. We design a PSO based solver to simultaneously select an optimal set of topics and learn corresponding features based on the selected topics. We develop a closed loop algorithm to iterate between 1) minimizing losses of representation reconstruction and feature-topic alignment and 2) searching the best topics. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the enhanced performance of our method."

However, existing attacks are often assessed using different SR models, recognition tasks and datasets, and only few adversarial defenses borrowed from computer vision are considered. Yet,these defenses have not been thoroughly evaluated against adaptive attacks. Thus, there is still a lack of quantitative understanding about the strengths and limitations of adversarial attacks and defenses. More effective defenses are also required for securing SR systems. To bridge this gap, we present SEC4SR, the first platform enabling researchers to systematically and comprehensively evaluate adversarial attacks and defenses in SR. SEC4SR incorporates 4 white-box and 2 black-box attacks, 24 defenses including our novel feature-level transformations. It also contains techniques for mounting adaptive attacks. Using SEC4SR, we conduct thus far the largest-scale empirical study on adversarial attacks and defenses in SR, involving 23 defenses, 15 attacks and 4 attack settings. Our study provides lots of useful findings that may advance future research: such as (1) all the transformations slightly degrade accuracy on benign examples and their effectiveness vary with attacks; (2) most transformations become less effective under adaptive attacks, but some transformations become more effective; (3) few transformations combined with adversarial training yield stronger defenses over some but not all attacks, while our feature-level transformation combined with adversarial training yields the strongest defense over all the attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate capabilities and advantages of SEC4SR which can benefit future research in SR."

Recent studies show that simulation results on synthetic data usually overestimate the capacity to super-resolve real-world images. In this context, more and more researchers devote themselves to develop SR approaches for realistic images. This article aims to make a comprehensive review on real-world single image super-resolution (RSISR). More specifically, this review covers the critical publically available datasets and assessment metrics for RSISR, and four major categories of RSISR methods, namely the degradation modeling-based RSISR, image pairs-based RSISR, domain translation-based RSISR, and self-learning-based RSISR.

Our work shows that such simple statistical information can enhance classification performance both efficiently and significantly compared with several baseline models. In this paper, we propose a classifier with gate mechanism named Adaptive Gate Attention model with Global Information (AGA+GI), in which the adaptive gate mechanism incorporates global statistical features into latent semantic features and the attention layer captures dependency relationship within the sentence. To alleviate the overfitting issue, we propose a novel Leaky Dropout mechanism to improve generalization ability and performance stability.

While we utilize semantic features during training, our method is agnostic to semantic information for unseen classes at test-time. Our method retains the efficiency and effectiveness of YOLOv2 for objects seen during training, while improving its performance for novel and unseen objects. The ability of state-of-art detection methods to learn discriminative object features to reject background proposals also limits their performance for unseen objects. We posit that, to detect unseen objects, we must incorporate semantic information into the visual domain so that the learned visual features reflect this information and leads to improved recall rates for unseen objects. We test our method on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO dataset and observed significant improvements on the average precision of unseen classes."

Especially, for multi-hop open-domain QA, scattered evidence pieces are required to be gathered together to support the answer extraction. In this paper, we propose a new retrieval target, hop, to collect the hidden reasoning evidence from Wikipedia for complex question answering. Specifically, the hop in this paper is defined as the combination of a hyperlink and the corresponding outbound link document. The hyperlink is encoded as the mention embedding which models the structured knowledge of how the outbound link entity is mentioned in the textual context, and the corresponding outbound link document is encoded as the document embedding representing the unstructured knowledge within it. Accordingly, we build HopRetriever which retrieves hops over Wikipedia to answer complex questions. Experiments on the HotpotQA dataset demonstrate that HopRetriever outperforms previously published evidence retrieval methods by large margins. Moreover, our approach also yields quantifiable interpretations of the evidence collection process."
926,aaai,2021,Bi-Classifier Determinacy Maximization for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17027,"Unsupervised domain adaptation challenges the problem of transferring knowledge from a well-labelled source domain to an unlabelled target domain. Recently,adversarial learning with bi-classifier has been proven effective in pushing cross-domain distributions close. Prior approaches typically leverage the disagreement between bi-classifier to learn transferable representations, however, they often neglect the classifier determinacy in the target domain, which could result in a lack of feature discriminability. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method, namely Bi-Classifier Determinacy Maximization(BCDM), to tackle this problem. Motivated by the observation that target samples cannot always be separated distinctly by the decision boundary, here in the proposed BCDM, we design a novel classifier determinacy disparity (CDD) metric, which formulates classifier discrepancy as the class relevance of distinct target predictions and implicitly introduces constraint on the target feature discriminability. To this end, the BCDM can generate discriminative representations by encouraging target predictive outputs to be consistent and determined, meanwhile, preserve the diversity of predictions in an adversarial manner. Furthermore, the properties of CDD as well as the theoretical guarantees of BCDM's generalization bound are both elaborated. Extensive experiments show that BCDM compares favorably against the existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods."
927,aaai,2021,An Efficient Transformer Decoder with Compressed Sub-layers,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i15.17572,"The large attention-based encoder-decoder network (Transformer) has become prevailing recently due to its effectiveness. But the high computation complexity of its decoder raises the inefficiency issue. By examining the mathematic formulation of the decoder, we show that under some mild conditions, the architecture could be simplified by compressing its sub-layers, the basic building block of Transformer, and achieves a higher parallelism. We thereby propose Compressed Attention Network, whose decoder layer consists of only one sub-layer instead of three. Extensive experiments on 14 WMT machine translation tasks show that our model is 1.42x faster with performance on par with a strong baseline. This strong baseline is already 2x faster than the widely used standard baseline without loss in performance."
928,aaai,2021,Sequential End-to-end Network for Efficient Person Search,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i3.16297,"Person search aims at jointly solving Person Detection and Person Re-identification (re-ID). Existing works have designed end-to-end networks based on Faster R-CNN. However, due to the parallel structure of Faster R-CNN, the extracted features come from the low-quality proposals generated by the Region Proposal Network, rather than the detected high-quality bounding boxes. Person search is a fine-grained task and such inferior features will significantly reduce re-ID performance. To address this issue, we propose a Sequential End-to-end Network (SeqNet) to extract superior features. In SeqNet, detection and re-ID are considered as a progressive process and tackled with two sub-networks sequentially. In addition, we design a robust Context Bipartite Graph Matching (CBGM) algorithm to effectively employ context information as an important complementary cue for person matching. Extensive experiments on two widely used person search benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU and PRW, have shown that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Also, our model runs at 11.5 fps on a single GPU and can be integrated into the existing end-to-end framework easily."
929,aaai,2021,Unsupervised Active Learning via Subspace Learning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.17013,"Subspace clustering is a growing field of unsupervised learning that has gained much popularity in the computer vision community. Applications can be found in areas such as motion segmentation and face clustering. It assumes that data originate from a union of subspaces, and clusters the data depending on the corresponding subspace. In practice, it is reasonable to assume that a limited amount of labels can be obtained, potentially at a cost. Therefore, algorithms that can effectively and efficiently incorporate this information to improve the clustering model are desirable. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework for subspace clustering that sequentially queries informative points and updates the subspace model. The query stage of the proposed framework relies on results from the perturbation theory of principal component analysis, to identify influential and potentially misclassified points. A constrained subspace clustering algorithm is proposed that monotonically decreases the objective function subject to the constraints imposed by the labelled data. We show that our proposed framework is suitable for subspace clustering algorithms including iterative methods and spectral methods. Experiments on synthetic data sets, motion segmentation data sets, and Yale Faces data sets demonstrate the advantage of our proposed active strategy over state-of-the-art."
930,aaai,2021,Improving the Efficiency and Effectiveness for BERT-based Entity Resolution,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i15.17562,"Entity resolution, a longstanding problem of data cleaning and integration, aims at identifying data records that represent the same real-world entity. Existing approaches treat entity resolution as a universal task, assuming the existence of a single interpretation of a real-world entity and focusing only on finding matched records, separating corresponding from non-corresponding ones, with respect to this single interpretation. However, in real-world scenarios, where entity resolution is part of a more general data project, downstream applications may have varying interpretations of real-world entities relating, for example, to various user needs. In what follows, we introduce the problem of multiple intents entity resolution (MIER), an extension to the universal (single intent) entity resolution task. As a solution, we propose FlexER, utilizing contemporary solutions to universal entity resolution tasks to solve multiple intents entity resolution. FlexER addresses the problem as a multi-label classification problem. It combines intent-based representations of tuple pairs using a multiplex graph representation that serves as an input to a graph neural network (GNN). FlexER learns intent representations and improves the outcome to multiple resolution problems. A large-scale empirical evaluation introduces a new benchmark and, using also two well-known benchmarks, shows that FlexER effectively solves the MIER problem and outperforms the state-of-the-art for a universal entity resolution."
931,aaai,2021,Scheduled Sampling in Vision-Language Pretraining with Decoupled Encoder-Decoder Network,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17034,"Despite having impressive vision-language (VL) pretraining with BERT-based encoder for VL understanding, the pretraining of a universal encoder-decoder for both VL understanding and generation remains challenging. The difficulty originates from the inherently different peculiarities of the two disciplines, e.g., VL understanding tasks capitalize on the unrestricted message passing across modalities, while generation tasks only employ visual-to-textual message passing. In this paper, we start with a two-stream decoupled design of encoder-decoder structure, in which two decoupled cross-modal encoder and decoder are involved to separately perform each type of proxy tasks, for simultaneous VL understanding and generation pretraining. Moreover, for VL pretraining, the dominant way is to replace some input visual/word tokens with mask tokens and enforce the multi-modal encoder/decoder to reconstruct the original tokens, but no mask token is involved when fine-tuning on downstream tasks. As an alternative, we propose a primary scheduled sampling strategy that elegantly mitigates such discrepancy via pretraining encoder-decoder in a two-pass manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the compelling generalizability of our pretrained encoder-decoder by fine-tuning on four VL understanding and generation downstream tasks.

In natural language processing fields, virtual adversarial training is introduced since texts are discrete and cannot be perturbed by gradients directly. Alternatively, virtual adversarial training, which generates perturbations on the embedding space, is introduced in NLP tasks. Despite its success, existing virtual adversarial training methods generate perturbations roughly constrained by Frobenius normalization balls. To craft fine-grained perturbations, we propose a Token-Aware Virtual Adversarial Training method. We introduce a token-level accumulated perturbation vocabulary to initialize the perturbations better and use a token-level normalization ball to constrain these perturbations pertinently. Experiments show that our method improves the performance of pre-trained models such as BERT and ALBERT in various tasks by a considerable margin. The proposed method improves the score of the GLUE benchmark from 78.3 to 80.9 using BERT model and it also enhances the performance of sequence labeling and text classification tasks."
933,aaai,2021,GoT: a Growing Tree Model for Clustering Ensemble,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.17015,"Ensemble methods are among the state-of-the-art predictive modeling approaches. Applied to modern big data, these methods often require a large number of sub-learners, where the complexity of each learner typically grows with the size of the dataset. This phenomenon results in an increasing demand for storage space, which may be very costly. This problem mostly manifests in a subscriber based environment, where a user-specific ensemble needs to be stored on a personal device with strict storage limitations (such as a cellular device). In this work we introduce a novel method for lossless compression of tree-based ensemble methods, focusing on random forests. Our suggested method is based on probabilistic modeling of the ensemble's trees, followed by model clustering via Bregman divergence. This allows us to find a minimal set of models that provides an accurate description of the trees, and at the same time is small enough to store and maintain. Our compression scheme demonstrates high compression rates on a variety of modern datasets. Importantly, our scheme enables predictions from the compressed format and a perfect reconstruction of the original ensemble. In addition, we introduce a theoretically sound lossy compression scheme, which allows us to control the trade-off between the distortion and the coding rate."

Compared with the well-studied machine reading comprehension (MRC), SQA is a more challenging task: a scenario may contain not only a textual passage to read but also structured data like tables, i.e., tabular scenario based question answering (TSQA). AI applications of TSQA such as answering multiple-choice questions in high-school exams require synthesizing data in multiple cells and combining tables with texts and domain knowledge to infer answers. To support the study of this task, we construct GeoTSQA. This dataset contains 1k real questions contextualized by tabular scenarios in the geography domain. To solve the task, we extend state-of-the-art MRC methods with TTGen, a novel table-to-text generator. It generates sentences from variously synthesized tabular data and feeds the downstream MRC method with the most useful sentences. Its sentence ranking model fuses the information in the scenario, question, and domain knowledge. Our approach outperforms a variety of strong baseline methods on GeoTSQA."
935,aaai,2021,MFES-HB: Efficient Hyperband with Multi-Fidelity Quality Measurements,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17031,"Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a fundamental problem in automatic machine learning (AutoML). However, due to the expensive evaluation cost of models (e.g., training deep learning models or training models on large datasets), vanilla Bayesian optimization (BO) is typically computationally infeasible. To alleviate this issue, Hyperband (HB) utilizes the early stopping mechanism to speed up configuration evaluations by terminating those badly-performing configurations in advance. This leads to two kinds of quality measurements: (1) many low-fidelity measurements for configurations that get early-stopped, and (2) few high-fidelity measurements for configurations that are evaluated without being early stopped. The state-of-the-art HB-style method, BOHB, aims to combine the benefits of both BO and HB. Instead of sampling configurations randomly in HB, BOHB samples configurations based on a BO surrogate model, which is constructed with the high-fidelity measurements only. However, the scarcity of high-fidelity measurements greatly hampers the efficiency of BO to guide the configuration search. In this paper, we present MFES-HB, an efficient Hyperband method that is capable of utilizing both the high-fidelity and low-fidelity measurements to accelerate the convergence of HPO tasks. Designing MFES-HB is not trivial as the low-fidelity measurements can be biased yet informative to guide the configuration search. Thus we propose to build a Multi- Fidelity Ensemble Surrogate (MFES) based on the generalized Product of Experts framework, which can integrate useful information from multi-fidelity measurements effectively. The empirical studies on the real-world AutoML tasks demonstrate that MFES-HB can achieve 3.3-8.9x speedups over the state-of-the-art approach - BOHB."

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid quantum-classical framework for supervised quantum learning, which we call Variational Shadow Quantum Learning (VSQL). Our method in particular utilizes the classical shadows of quantum data, which fundamentally represent the side information of quantum data with respect to certain physical observables. Specifically, we first use variational shadow quantum circuits to extract classical features in a convolution way and then utilize a fully-connected neural network to complete the classification task. We show that this method could sharply reduce the number of parameters and thus better facilitate quantum circuit training. Simultaneously, less noise will be introduced since fewer quantum gates are employed in such shadow circuits. Moreover, we show that the Barren Plateau issue, a significant gradient vanishing problem in quantum machine learning, could be avoided in VSQL. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of VSQL in quantum classification via numerical experiments on the classification of quantum states and the recognition of multi-labeled handwritten digits. In particular, our VSQL approach outperforms existing variational quantum classifiers in the test accuracy in the binary case of handwritten digit recognition and notably requires much fewer parameters."

Besides, over-reliance on the stand-alone depth estimator, requiring a large number of pixel-wise annotations in the training stage and more computation in the inferencing stage, limits the scaling application in the real world.   In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate 3D object detection method from stereo images, named RTS3D. Different from the 3D occupancy space in the Pseudo-LiDAR similar methods, we design a novel 4D feature-consistent embedding (FCE) space as the intermediate representation of the 3D scene without depth supervision. The FCE space encodes the object's structural and semantic information by exploring the multi-scale feature consistency warped from stereo pair. Furthermore, a semantic-guided RBF (Radial Basis Function) and a structure-aware attention module are devised to reduce the influence of FCE space noise without instance mask supervision. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that RTS3D is the first true real-time system (FPS$>$24) for stereo image 3D detection meanwhile achieves $10\%$ improvement in average precision comparing with the previous state-of-the-art method. The code will be available at https://github.com/Banconxuan/RTS3D"

However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making. This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the propagation of traffic waves in traffic flow data. This method can be applied to impute traffic state data from fixed sensors or probe vehicles. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD programs. Considering current and future mixed traffic of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with the traffic state estimation scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories, mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and robustness."

However, exploring all possible GNNs architectures in the huge search space is too time-consuming or impossible for big graph data. In this paper, we propose a parallel graph architecture search (GraphPAS) framework for graph neural networks. In GraphPAS, we explore the search space in parallel by designing a sharing-based evolution learning, which can improve the search efficiency without losing the accuracy. Additionally, architecture information entropy is adopted dynamically for mutation selection probability, which can reduce space exploration. The experimental result shows that GraphPAS outperforms state-of-art models with efficiency and accuracy simultaneously."

We obtain such a dynamic via perturbation by an arbitrary lower semicontinuous, strongly convex regularizer in Bayesian population games with finitely many strategies. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence of rest points of the RBBR learning dynamic, and hence the existence of regularized Bayesian equilibrium in Bayesian population games. These equilibria are shown to approximate the original Bayesian equilibria for vanishingly small perturbations. We also explore the fundamental properties of the RBBR learning dynamic, which includes the existence of unique continuous solutions from arbitrary initial conditions, as well as the continuity of the solution trajectories thus obtained with respect to the initial conditions. Finally, as application the the theory we introduce the notions of Bayesian potential and Bayesian negative semidefinite games and provide convergence results for such games."

Recently, the nested NER has attracted more attention since its practicality and difficulty. Existing works for nested NER ignore the recognition order and boundary position relation of nested entities. To address these issues, we propose a novel seq2seq model named GPRL, which formulates the nested NER task as an entity triplet sequence generation process. GPRL adopts the reinforcement learning method to generate entity triplets decoupling the entity order in gold labels and expects to learn a reasonable recognition order of entities via trial and error. Based on statistics of boundary distance for nested entities, GPRL designs a Gaussian prior to represent the boundary distance distribution between nested entities and adjust the output probability distribution of nested boundary tokens. Experiments on three nested NER datasets demonstrate that GPRL outperforms previous nested NER models."

Given a matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, sublinear algorithms for the matrix game $\min_{x\in\mathcal{X}}\max_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} y^{\top} Ax$ were previously known only for two special cases: (1) $\mathcal{Y}$ being the $\ell_{1}$-norm unit ball, and (2) $\mathcal{X}$ being either the $\ell_{1}$- or the $\ell_{2}$-norm unit ball. We give a sublinear classical algorithm that can interpolate smoothly between these two cases: for any fixed $q\in (1,2]$, we solve the matrix game where $\mathcal{X}$ is a $\ell_{q}$-norm unit ball within additive error $\epsilon$ in time $\tilde{O}((n+d)/{\epsilon^{2}})$. We also provide a corresponding sublinear quantum algorithm that solves the same task in time $\tilde{O}((\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{d})\textrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ with a quadratic improvement in both $n$ and $d$. Both our classical and quantum algorithms are optimal in the dimension parameters $n$ and $d$ up to poly-logarithmic factors.

Existing research explores to utilize document-level structural information to sample positive and negative instances for model training. Although the approach achieves positive results, it introduces a sampling bias and fails to distinguish instances with high semantic similarity. To alleviate the bias, we propose a new sampling strategy to select additional intra-document image-sentence pairs as positive or negative samples. Furthermore, to recognize the complex pattern in intra-document samples, we propose a Transformer based model to capture fine-grained features and implicitly construct a graph for each document, where concepts in a document are introduced to bridge the representation learning of images and sentences in the context of a document. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach to alleviate the bias and learn well-aligned multimodal representations."

The distinct feature of ExtraFW is the pair of gradients leveraged per iteration, thanks to which the decision variable is updated in a prediction-correction (PC) format. Relying on no problem dependent parameters in the step sizes, the convergence rate of ExtraFW for general convex problems is shown to be ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{k})$, which is optimal in the sense of matching the lower bound on the number of solved FW subproblems. However, the merit of ExtraFW is its faster rate ${\cal O}\big(\frac{1}{k^2} \big)$ on a class of machine learning problems. Compared with other parameter-free FW variants that have faster rates on the same problems, ExtraFW has improved rates and fine-grained analysis thanks to its PC update. Numerical tests on binary classification with different sparsity-promoting constraints demonstrate that the empirical performance of ExtraFW is significantly better than FW, and even faster than Nesterov's accelerated gradient on certain datasets. For matrix completion, ExtraFW enjoys smaller optimality gap, and lower rank than FW."

In offline signature verification system dynamic features are not available obviously, but one can use a signature as an image and apply image processing techniques to make an effective offline signature verification system. Author proposes a intelligent network used directional feature and energy density both as inputs to the same network and classifies the signature. Neural network is used as a classifier for this system. The results are compared with both the very basic energy density method and a simple directional feature method of offline signature verification system and this proposed new network is found very effective as compared to the above two methods, specially for less number of training samples, which can be implemented practically."

In this data set, each data points is presented by multiple different views. In this paper, we propose a novel method for this problem. This method is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that each data point has an intact feature vector, and each view is obtained by a linear transformation from the intact vector. The second assumption is that the intact vectors are discriminative, and in the intact space, we have a linear classifier to separate the positive class from the negative class. We define an intact vector for each data point, and a view-conditional transformation matrix for each view, and propose to reconstruct the multiple view feature vectors by the product of the corresponding intact vectors and transformation matrices. Moreover, we also propose a linear classifier in the intact space, and learn it jointly with the intact vectors. The learning problem is modeled by a minimization problem, and the objective function is composed of a Cauchy error estimator-based view-conditional reconstruction term over all data points and views, and a classification error term measured by hinge loss over all the intact vectors of all the data points. Some regularization terms are also imposed to different variables in the objective function. The minimization problem is solve by an iterative algorithm using alternate optimization strategy and gradient descent algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows it advantage in the compression to other multiview learning algorithms on benchmark data sets."

Two strands of research are promising to improve models of this kind: the first uses wide networks (a.k.a. Transformer-Big) and has been the de facto standard for the development of the Transformer system, and the other uses deeper language representation but faces the difficulty arising from learning deep networks. Here, we continue the line of research on the latter. We claim that a truly deep Transformer model can surpass the Transformer-Big counterpart by 1) proper use of layer normalization and 2) a novel way of passing the combination of previous layers to the next. On WMT'16 English- German, NIST OpenMT'12 Chinese-English and larger WMT'18 Chinese-English tasks, our deep system (30/25-layer encoder) outperforms the shallow Transformer-Big/Base baseline (6-layer encoder) by 0.4-2.4 BLEU points.

It is well-known that different sensors are capable of capturing complementary information for a given geographical area and a classification module incorporating information from all the sources are expected to produce an improved performance as compared to considering only a subset of the modalities. However, the classical classifier systems inherently require all the features used to train the module to be present for the test instances as well, which may not always be possible for typical remote sensing applications (say, disaster management). As a remedy, we provide a robust solution in terms of a hallucination module that can approximate the missing modalities from the available ones during the decision-making stage. In order to ensure better knowledge transfer during modality hallucination, we explicitly incorporate concepts of knowledge distillation for the purpose of exploring the privileged (side) information in our framework and subsequently introduce an intuitive modular training approach. The proposed network is evaluated extensively on a large-scale corpus of PAN-MS image pairs (scene recognition) as well as on a benchmark hyperspectral image dataset (image classification) where we follow different experimental scenarios and find that the proposed hallucination based module indeed is capable of capturing the multi-source information, albeit the explicit absence of some of the sensor information, and aid in improved scene characterization."

In the proposed method, both the generator and discriminator are designed with deep encoder-decoder architectures as their backbones. To be more specific, the encoder-decoder structured generator is used to learn a pose disentangled face representation, and the encoder-decoder structured discriminator is tasked to perform real/fake classification, face reconstruction, determining identity and estimating face pose. We further improve the proposed network architecture by minimising the additional pixel-wise loss defined by the Wasserstein distance at the output of the discriminator so that the adversarial framework can be better trained. Additionally, we consider face pose variation to be continuous, rather than discrete in existing literature, to inject richer pose information into our model. The pose estimation task is formulated as a regression problem, which helps to disentangle identity information from pose variations. The proposed network is evaluated on the tasks of pose-invariant face recognition (PIFR) and face synthesis across poses. An extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation carried out on several controlled and in-the-wild benchmarking datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed DED-GAN method over the state-of-the-art approaches."

In this work, we propose EmotionGesture, a novel framework for synthesizing vivid and diverse emotional co-speech 3D gestures from audio. Considering emotion is often entangled with the rhythmic beat in speech audio, we first develop an Emotion-Beat Mining module (EBM) to extract the emotion and audio beat features as well as model their correlation via a transcript-based visual-rhythm alignment. Then, we propose an initial pose based Spatial-Temporal Prompter (STP) to generate future gestures from the given initial poses. STP effectively models the spatial-temporal correlations between the initial poses and the future gestures, thus producing the spatial-temporal coherent pose prompt. Once we obtain pose prompts, emotion, and audio beat features, we will generate 3D co-speech gestures through a transformer architecture. However, considering the poses of existing datasets often contain jittering effects, this would lead to generating unstable gestures. To address this issue, we propose an effective objective function, dubbed Motion-Smooth Loss. Specifically, we model motion offset to compensate for jittering ground-truth by forcing gestures to be smooth. Last, we present an emotion-conditioned VAE to sample emotion features, enabling us to generate diverse emotional results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving vivid and diverse emotional co-speech 3D gestures."

To achieve this goal, many unsupervised learning representation disentanglement approaches have been developed. However, the training process without utilizing any supervision signal have been proved to be inadequate for disentanglement representation learning. Therefore, we propose a novel weakly-supervised training approach, named as SW-VAE, which incorporates pairs of input observations as supervision signals by using the generative factors of datasets. Furthermore, we introduce strategies to gradually increase the learning difficulty during training to smooth the training process. As shown on several datasets, our model shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representation disentanglement tasks."

However, they are treated as black boxes and lack interpretability. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework, heterogeneous rendering machines (HRM), that interprets how neural generators render an input dialogue act (DA) into an utterance. HRM consists of a renderer set and a mode switcher. The renderer set contains multiple decoders that vary in both structure and functionality. For every generation step, the mode switcher selects an appropriate decoder from the renderer set to generate an item (a word or a phrase). To verify the effectiveness of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets. In terms of automatic metrics (e.g., BLEU), our model is competitive with the current state-of-the-art method. The qualitative analysis shows that our model can interpret the rendering process of neural generators well. Human evaluation also confirms the interpretability of our proposed approach."

While most previous RE methods focus on leveraging deterministic KGs, uncertain KGs, which assign a confidence score for each relation instance, can provide prior probability distributions of relational facts as valuable external knowledge for RE models. This paper proposes to exploit uncertain knowledge to improve relation extraction. Specifically, we introduce ProBase, an uncertain KG that indicates to what extent a target entity belongs to a concept, into our RE architecture. We then design a novel multi-view inference framework to systematically integrate local context and global knowledge across three views: mention-, entity- and concept-view. The experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performances on both sentence- and document-level relation extraction, which verifies the effectiveness of introducing uncertain knowledge and the multi-view inference framework that we design."

Most of those methods use $\ell^{1}$-norm or $\ell^{2}$-norm with thresholding to impose the sparsity of the constructed sparse similarity graph, and certain assumptions, e.g. independence or disjointness, on the subspaces are required to obtain the subspace-sparse representation, which is the key to their success. Such assumptions are not guaranteed to hold in practice and they limit the application of sparse subspace clustering on subspaces with general location. In this paper, we propose a new sparse subspace clustering method named $\ell^{0}$-graph. In contrast to the required assumptions on subspaces for most existing sparse subspace clustering methods, it is proved that subspace-sparse representation can be obtained by $\ell^{0}$-graph for arbitrary distinct underlying subspaces almost surely under the mild i.i.d. assumption on the data generation. We develop a proximal method to obtain the sub-optimal solution to the optimization problem of $\ell^{0}$-graph with proved guarantee of convergence. Moreover, we propose a regularized $\ell^{0}$-graph that encourages nearby data to have similar neighbors so that the similarity graph is more aligned within each cluster and the graph connectivity issue is alleviated. Extensive experimental results on various data sets demonstrate the superiority of $\ell^{0}$-graph compared to other competing clustering methods, as well as the effectiveness of regularized $\ell^{0}$-graph."

Existing frameworks typically utilize given spatial adjacency graph and sophisticated mechanisms for modeling spatial and temporal correlations. However, limited representations of given spatial graph structure with incomplete adjacent connections may restrict effective spatial-temporal dependencies learning of those models. To overcome those limitations, our paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Networks (STFGNN) for traffic flow forecasting. SFTGNN could effectively learn hidden spatial-temporal dependencies by a novel fusion operation of various spatial and temporal graphs, which is generated by a data-driven method. Meanwhile, by integrating this fusion graph module and a novel gated convolution module into a unified layer, SFTGNN could handle long sequences. Experimental results on several public traffic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance consistently than other baselines."

Therefore, the process of automatic information extraction from documents containing legal opinions related to court cases can be considered to be of significant importance. This study is focused on the identification of sentences in legal opinion texts which convey different perspectives on a certain topic or entity. We combined several approaches based on semantic analysis, open information extraction, and sentiment analysis to achieve our objective. Then, our methodology was evaluated with the help of human judges. The outcomes of the evaluation demonstrate that our system is successful in detecting situations where two sentences deliver different opinions on the same topic or entity. The proposed methodology can be used to facilitate other information extraction tasks related to the legal domain. One such task is the automated detection of counter arguments for a given argument. Another is the identification of opponent parties in a court case."

Due to the complexity and the nature of insurance products, a cost-effective online sales solution is to exploit chatbot AI to raise customers' attention and pass those with interests to human agents for further sales. For high response and conversion rates of customers, it is crucial for the chatbot to initiate a conversation with personalized opening sentences, which are generated with user-specific topic selection and ordering. Such personalized opening sentence generation is challenging because (i) there are limited historical samples for conversation topic recommendation in online insurance sales and (ii) existing text generation schemes often fail to support customized topic ordering based on user preferences. We design POSGen, a personalized opening sentence generation scheme dedicated for online insurance sales. It transfers user embeddings learned from auxiliary online user behaviours to enhance conversation topic recommendation, and exploits a context management unit to arrange the recommended topics in user-specific ordering for opening sentence generation. POSGen is deployed on a real-world online insurance platform. It achieves 2.33x total insurance premium improvement through a two-month global test."
959,aaai,2021,Group-Wise Semantic Mining for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i3.16294,"Object region mining is a critical step for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Most recent methods mine the object regions by expanding the seed regions localized by class activation maps. They generally do not consider the sizes of objects and apply a monotonous procedure to mining all the object regions. Thus their mined regions are often insufficient in number and scale for large objects, and on the other hand easily contaminated by surrounding backgrounds for small objects. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-miner framework to perform a region mining process that adapts to diverse object sizes and is thus able to mine more integral and finer object regions. Specifically, our multi-miner leverages a parallel modulator to check whether there are remaining object regions for each single object, and guide a category-aware generator to mine the regions of each object independently. In this way, the multi-miner adaptively takes more steps for large objects and fewer steps for small objects. Experiment results demonstrate that the multi-miner offers better region mining results and helps achieve better segmentation performance than state-of-the-art weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods."
960,aaai,2021,ACT: an Attentive Convolutional Transformer for Efficient Text Classification,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i15.17566,"Text classification has been one of the major problems in natural language processing. With the advent of deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been a popular solution to this task. However, CNNs which were first proposed for images, face many crucial challenges in the context of text processing, namely in their elementary blocks: convolution filters and max pooling. These challenges have largely been overlooked by the most existing CNN models proposed for text classification. In this paper, we present an experimental study on the fundamental blocks of CNNs in text categorization. Based on this critique, we propose Sequential Convolutional Attentive Recurrent Network (SCARN). The proposed SCARN model utilizes both the advantages of recurrent and convolutional structures efficiently in comparison to previously proposed recurrent convolutional models. We test our model on different text classification datasets across tasks like sentiment analysis and question classification. Extensive experiments establish that SCARN outperforms other recurrent convolutional architectures with significantly less parameters. Furthermore, SCARN achieves better performance compared to equally large various deep CNN and LSTM architectures."

However, traditional methods still cannot satisfy practical requirements. In this paper, we explore and adapt various neural network architectures to see if they can be generalized to work with the symbolic representation of music and produce satisfactory melodic phrase segmentation. The main issue of applying deep-learning methods to phrase detection is the sparse labeling problem of training sets. We proposed two tailored label engineering with corresponding training techniques for different neural networks in order to make decisions at a sequential level. Experiment results show that the CNN-CRF architecture performs the best, being able to offer finer segmentation and faster to train, while CNN, Bi-LSTM-CNN and Bi-LSTM-CRF are acceptable alternatives."
962,aaai,2021,Synergetic Learning of Heterogeneous Temporal Sequences for Multi-Horizon Probabilistic Forecasting,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17023,"Time-series is ubiquitous across applications, such as transportation, finance and healthcare. Time-series is often influenced by external factors, especially in the form of asynchronous events, making forecasting difficult. However, existing models are mainly designated for either synchronous time-series or asynchronous event sequence, and can hardly provide a synthetic way to capture the relation between them. We propose Variational Synergetic Multi-Horizon Network (VSMHN), a novel deep conditional generative model. To learn complex correlations across heterogeneous sequences, a tailored encoder is devised to combine the advances in deep point processes models and variational recurrent neural networks. In addition, an aligned time coding and an auxiliary transition scheme are carefully devised for batched training on unaligned sequences. Our model can be trained effectively using stochastic variational inference and generates probabilistic predictions with Monte-Carlo simulation. Furthermore, our model produces accurate, sharp and more realistic probabilistic forecasts. We also show that modeling asynchronous event sequences is crucial for multi-horizon time-series forecasting."
963,aaai,2021,Learning Graph Neural Networks with Approximate Gradient Descent,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17025,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have pioneered advancements in graph representation learning, exhibiting superior feature learning and performance over multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) when handling graph inputs. However, understanding the feature learning aspect of GNNs is still in its initial stage. This study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the role of graph convolution within the context of feature learning theory in neural networks using gradient descent training. We provide a distinct characterization of signal learning and noise memorization in two-layer graph convolutional networks (GCNs), contrasting them with two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our findings reveal that graph convolution significantly augments the benign overfitting regime over the counterpart CNNs, where signal learning surpasses noise memorization, by approximately factor $\sqrt{D}^{q-2}$, with $D$ denoting a node's expected degree and $q$ being the power of the ReLU activation function where $q > 2$. These findings highlight a substantial discrepancy between GNNs and MLPs in terms of feature learning and generalization capacity after gradient descent training, a conclusion further substantiated by our empirical simulations."
964,aaai,2021,Outlier Impact Characterization for Time Series Data,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17379,"Data pre-treatment plays a significant role in improving data quality, thus allowing extraction of accurate information from raw data. One of the data pre-treatment techniques commonly used is outliers detection. The so-called 3${\sigma}$ method is a common practice to identify the outliers. As shown in the manuscript, it does not identify all outliers, resulting in possible distortion of the overall statistics of the data. This problem can have a significant impact on further data analysis and can lead to reduction in the accuracy of predictive models. There is a plethora of various techniques for outliers detection, however, aside from theoretical work, they all require case study work. Two types of outliers were considered: short-term (erroneous data, noise) and long-term outliers (e.g. malfunctioning for longer periods). The data used were taken from the vacuum distillation unit (VDU) of an Asian refinery and included 40 physical sensors (temperature, pressure and flow rate). We used a modified method for 3${\sigma}$ thresholds to identify the short-term outliers, i.e. ensors data are divided into chunks determined by change points and 3${\sigma}$ thresholds are calculated within each chunk representing near-normal distribution. We have shown that piecewise 3${\sigma}$ method offers a better approach to short-term outliers detection than 3${\sigma}$ method applied to the entire time series. Nevertheless, this does not perform well for long-term outliers (which can represent another state in the data). In this case, we used principal component analysis (PCA) with Hotelling's $T^2$ statistics to identify the long-term outliers. The results obtained with PCA were subject to DBSCAN clustering method. The outliers (which were visually obvious and correctly detected by the PCA method) were also correctly identified by DBSCAN which supported the consistency and accuracy of the PCA method."

While most building mapping models produce vector polygons of buildings for geographic and mapping systems, dominant methods typically decompose polygonal building extraction in some sub-problems, including segmentation, polygonization, and regularization, leading to complex inference procedures, low accuracy, and poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel building mapping method with Hierarchical Transformers, called HiT, improving polygonal building mapping quality from high-resolution remote sensing images. HiT builds on a two-stage detection architecture by adding a polygon head parallel to classification and bounding box regression heads. HiT simultaneously outputs building bounding boxes and vector polygons, which is fully end-to-end trainable. The polygon head formulates a building polygon as serialized vertices with the bidirectional characteristic, a simple and elegant polygon representation avoiding the start or end vertex hypothesis. Under this new perspective, the polygon head adopts a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to predict serialized vertices supervised by the designed bidirectional polygon loss. Furthermore, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with convolution operation is introduced in the encoder of the polygon head, providing more geometric structures of building polygons at vertex and edge levels. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmarks (the CrowdAI and Inria datasets) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in terms of instance segmentation and polygonal metrics compared with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, qualitative results verify the superiority and effectiveness of our model under complex scenes."
966,aaai,2021,Large Norms of CNN Layers Do Not Hurt Adversarial Robustness,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17039,"Since the Lipschitz properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely considered to be related to adversarial robustness, we theoretically characterize the $\ell_1$ norm and $\ell_\infty$ norm of 2D multi-channel convolutional layers and provide efficient methods to compute the exact $\ell_1$ norm and $\ell_\infty$ norm. Based on our theorem, we propose a novel regularization method termed norm decay, which can effectively reduce the norms of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. Experiments show that norm-regularization methods, including norm decay, weight decay, and singular value clipping, can improve generalization of CNNs. However, they can slightly hurt adversarial robustness. Observing this unexpected phenomenon, we compute the norms of layers in the CNNs trained with three different adversarial training frameworks and surprisingly find that adversarially robust CNNs have comparable or even larger layer norms than their non-adversarially robust counterparts. Furthermore, we prove that under a mild assumption, adversarially robust classifiers can be achieved using neural networks, and an adversarially robust neural network can have an arbitrarily large Lipschitz constant. For this reason, enforcing small norms on CNN layers may be neither necessary nor effective in achieving adversarial robustness.

All the previous works model and predict the trajectory with a single resolution, which is rather inefficient and difficult to simultaneously exploit the long-range information (e.g., the destination of the trajectory), and the short-range information (e.g., the walking direction and speed at a certain time) of the motion behavior. In this paper, we propose a temporal pyramid network for pedestrian trajectory prediction through a squeeze modulation and a dilation modulation. Our hierarchical framework builds a feature pyramid with increasingly richer temporal information from top to bottom, which can better capture the motion behavior at various tempos. Furthermore, we propose a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy with multi-supervision. By progressively merging the top coarse features of global context to the bottom fine features of rich local context, our method can fully exploit both the long-range and short-range information of the trajectory. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method."

Due to the implicit nature of conveying emotions in many scenarios, commonsense knowledge is widely utilized to enrich utterance semantics and enhance conversation modeling. However, most previous knowledge infusion methods perform empirical knowledge filtering and design highly customized architectures for knowledge interaction with the utterances, which can discard useful knowledge aspects and limit their generalizability to different knowledge sources. Based on these observations, we propose a Bipartite Heterogeneous Graph (BHG) method for enhancing emotional reasoning with commonsense knowledge. In BHG, the extracted context-aware utterance representations and knowledge representations are modeled as heterogeneous nodes. Two more knowledge aggregation node types are proposed to perform automatic knowledge filtering and interaction. BHG-based knowledge infusion can be directly generalized to multi-type and multi-grained knowledge sources. In addition, we propose a Multi-dimensional Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (MHGT) to perform graph reasoning, which can retain unchanged feature spaces and unequal dimensions for heterogeneous node types during inference to prevent unnecessary loss of information. Experiments show that BHG-based methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art knowledge infusion methods and show generalized knowledge infusion ability with higher efficiency. Further analysis proves that previous empirical knowledge filtering methods do not guarantee to provide the most useful knowledge information.

However, traditional CF relies on the privacy-invasive collection of users' explicit and implicit feedback to build a central recommender model. One-shot federated learning has recently emerged as a method to mitigate the privacy problem while addressing the traditional communication bottleneck of federated learning. In this paper, we present the first unsupervised one-shot federated CF implementation, named FedSPLIT, based on NMF joint factorization. In our solution, the clients first apply local CF in-parallel to build distinct client-specific recommenders. Then, the privacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared with the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the global item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to build the local models via knowledge distillation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with standard recommendation datasets. FedSPLIT can obtain similar results than the state of the art (and even outperform it in certain situations) with a substantial decrease in the number of communications."

However, such methods have two key shortcomings: (i) They rely on ad hoc heuristics or expensive trial and error to choose the effective kernels, and (ii) They fail to handle multilevel correlation structure in the data. We introduce Longitudinal deep kernel Gaussian process regression (L-DKGPR), which to the best of our knowledge, is the only method to overcome these limitations by fully automating the discovery of complex multilevel correlation structure from longitudinal data. Specifically, L-DKGPR eliminates the need for ad hoc heuristics or trial and error using a novel adaptation of deep kernel learning that combines the expressive power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of non-parametric kernel methods. L-DKGPR effectively learns the multilevel correlation with a novel addictive kernel that simultaneously accommodates both time-varying and the time-invariant effects. We derive an efficient algorithm to train L-DKGPR using latent space inducing points and variational inference. Results of extensive experiments on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that L-DKGPR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art longitudinal data analysis (LDA) methods."

Prune-Tune alleviates the over-fitting and the degradation problem without model modification. Furthermore, Prune-Tune is able to sequentially learn a single network with multiple disjoint domain-specific sub-networks for multiple domains.

We conduct an assessment experimentation and show strong correlation between the proposed measures and human judgement on topical edge quality. We also introduce heterogeneous algorithm to build hierarchical topic models for heterogeneous data sources. We show how making certain adjustments to learning process helps to retain original structure of customized models while allowing for slight coherent modifications for new documents. We evaluate this approach using the proposed measures and show that the proposed heterogeneous algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline concat approach.

Empirically, smoothing has been shown to improve both predictive performance and model calibration. In this paper, we study whether label smoothing is also effective as a means of coping with label noise. While label smoothing apparently amplifies this problem --- being equivalent to injecting symmetric noise to the labels --- we show how it relates to a general family of loss-correction techniques from the label noise literature. Building on this connection, we show that label smoothing is competitive with loss-correction under label noise. Further, we show that when distilling models from noisy data, label smoothing of the teacher is beneficial; this is in contrast to recent findings for noise-free problems, and sheds further light on settings where label smoothing is beneficial."

In many learning tasks with limited training samples, the diffusion connects the labeled and unlabeled data points and is a critical component for achieving high classification accuracy. Many existing deep learning approaches directly impose the fusion loss when training neural networks. In this work, inspired by the convection-diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we propose a novel diffusion residual network (Diff-ResNet), internally introduces diffusion into the architectures of neural networks. Under the structured data assumption, it is proved that the proposed diffusion block can increase the distance-diameter ratio that improves the separability of inter-class points and reduces the distance among local intra-class points. Moreover, this property can be easily adopted by the residual networks for constructing the separable hyperplanes. Extensive experiments of synthetic binary classification, semi-supervised graph node classification and few-shot image classification in various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Current game character customization systems either require players to manually adjust considerable face attributes to obtain the desired face, or have limited freedom of facial shape and texture. In this paper, we propose an automatic character face creation method that predicts both facial shape and texture from a single portrait, and it can be integrated into most existing 3D games. Although 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) based methods can restore accurate 3D faces from single images, the topology of 3DMM mesh is different from the meshes used in most games. To acquire fidelity texture, existing methods require a large amount of face texture data for training, while building such datasets is time-consuming and laborious. Besides, such a dataset collected under laboratory conditions may not generalized well to in-the-wild situations. To tackle these problems, we propose 1) a low-cost facial texture acquisition method, 2) a shape transfer algorithm that can transform the shape of a 3DMM mesh to games, and 3) a new pipeline for training 3D game face reconstruction networks. The proposed method not only can produce detailed and vivid game characters similar to the input portrait, but can also eliminate the influence of lighting and occlusions.

The definition of the 2-category of diagrammatic logics rely on category theory, mainly on adjunction, categories of fractions and limit sketches. This framework is applied to the formalization of a parameterization process. This process, which consists in adding a formal parameter to some operations in a given specification, is presented as a morphism of logics. Then the parameter passing process, for recovering a model of the given specification from a model of the parameterized specification and an actual parameter, is seen as a 2-morphism of logics."
980,aaai,2021,Augmented Partial Mutual Learning with Frame Masking for Video Captioning,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i3.16301,"The canonical approach to video captioning dictates a caption generation model to learn from offline-extracted dense video features. These feature extractors usually operate on video frames sampled at a fixed frame rate and are often trained on image/video understanding tasks, without adaption to video captioning data. In this work, we present SwinBERT, an end-to-end transformer-based model for video captioning, which takes video frame patches directly as inputs, and outputs a natural language description. Instead of leveraging multiple 2D/3D feature extractors, our method adopts a video transformer to encode spatial-temporal representations that can adapt to variable lengths of video input without dedicated design for different frame rates. Based on this model architecture, we show that video captioning can benefit significantly from more densely sampled video frames as opposed to previous successes with sparsely sampled video frames for video-and-language understanding tasks (e.g., video question answering). Moreover, to avoid the inherent redundancy in consecutive video frames, we propose adaptively learning a sparse attention mask and optimizing it for task-specific performance improvement through better long-range video sequence modeling. Through extensive experiments on 5 video captioning datasets, we show that SwinBERT achieves across-the-board performance improvements over previous methods, often by a large margin. The learned sparse attention masks in addition push the limit to new state of the arts, and can be transferred between different video lengths and between different datasets.

However, the extent to which existing MWP solvers truly understand language and its relation with numbers is still unclear. In this paper, we generate adversarial attacks to evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art MWP solvers. We propose two methods Question Reordering and Sentence Paraphrasing to generate adversarial attacks. We conduct experiments across three neural MWP solvers over two benchmark datasets. On average, our attack method is able to reduce the accuracy of MWP solvers by over 40 percentage points on these datasets. Our results demonstrate that existing MWP solvers are sensitive to linguistic variations in the problem text. We verify the validity and quality of generated adversarial examples through human evaluation."
982,aaai,2021,The Adapter-Bot: All-In-One Controllable Conversational Model,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i18.18018,"Non-goal oriented dialog agents (i.e. chatbots) aim to produce varying and engaging conversations with a user; however, they typically exhibit either inconsistent personality across conversations or the average personality of all users. This paper addresses these issues by controlling an agent's persona upon generation via conditioning on prior conversations of a target actor. In doing so, we are able to utilize more abstract patterns within a person's speech and better emulate them in generated responses. This work introduces the Generative Conversation Control model, an augmented and fine-tuned GPT-2 language model that conditions on past reference conversations to probabilistically model multi-turn conversations in the actor's persona. We introduce an accompanying data collection procedure to obtain 10.3M conversations from 6 months worth of Reddit comments. We demonstrate that scaling model sizes from 117M to 8.3B parameters yields an improvement from 23.14 to 13.14 perplexity on 1.7M held out Reddit conversations. Increasing model scale yielded similar improvements in human evaluations that measure preference of model samples to the held out target distribution in terms of realism (31% increased to 37% preference), style matching (37% to 42%), grammar and content quality (29% to 42%), and conversation coherency (32% to 40%). We find that conditionally modeling past conversations improves perplexity by 0.47 in automatic evaluations. Through human trials we identify positive trends between conditional modeling and style matching and outline steps to further improve persona control."
983,aaai,2021,Pre-training Context and Time Aware Location Embeddings from Spatial-Temporal Trajectories for User Next Location Prediction,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16548,"Next POI recommendation intends to forecast users' immediate future movements given their current status and historical information, yielding great values for both users and service providers. However, this problem is perceptibly complex because various data trends need to be considered together. This includes the spatial locations, temporal contexts, user's preferences, etc. Most existing studies view the next POI recommendation as a sequence prediction problem while omitting the collaborative signals from other users. Instead, we propose a user-agnostic global trajectory flow map and a novel Graph Enhanced Transformer model (GETNext) to better exploit the extensive collaborative signals for a more accurate next POI prediction, and alleviate the cold start problem in the meantime. GETNext incorporates the global transition patterns, user's general preference, spatio-temporal context, and time-aware category embeddings together into a transformer model to make the prediction of user's future moves. With this design, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin and also sheds light on the cold start challenges within the spatio-temporal involved recommendation problems."

Videos recorded with binaural audio particular simulate how human receives ambient sound. However, a large number of videos are with monaural audio only, which would degrade the user experience due to the lack of ambient information. To address this issue, we propose an audio spatialization framework to convert a monaural video into a binaural one exploiting the relationship across audio and visual components. By preserving the left-right consistency in both audio and visual modalities, our learning strategy can be viewed as a self-supervised learning technique, and alleviates the dependency on a large amount of video data with ground truth binaural audio data during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed framework in both semi-supervised and fully supervised scenarios, with ablation studies and visualization further support the use of our model for audio spatialization."

Designing infographics can be a tedious process for non-experts and time-consuming, even for professional designers. With the help of designers, we propose a semi-automated infographic framework for general structured and flow-based infographic design generation. For novice designers, our framework automatically creates and ranks infographic designs for a user-provided text with no requirement for design input. However, expert designers can still provide custom design inputs to customize the infographics. We will also contribute an individual visual group (VG) designs dataset (in SVG), along with a 1k complete infographic image dataset with segmented VGs in this work. Evaluation results confirm that by using our framework, designers from all expertise levels can generate generic infographic designs faster than existing methods while maintaining the same quality as hand-designed infographics templates."

However, existing methods usually synthesize novel views only from a single source view, and it is non-trivial to generalize them to handle multiple source views for pursuing higher reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based view synthesis paradigm, which learns a unified 3D point cloud from different source views. Specifically, we first construct sub-point clouds by projecting source views to 3D space based on their depth maps. Then, we learn the unified 3D point cloud by adaptively fusing points at a local neighborhood defined on the union of the sub-point clouds. Besides, we also propose a 3D geometry-guided image restoration module to fill the holes and recover high-frequency details of the rendered novel views. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods to a large extent both quantitatively and visually."

In this paper, we propose a frame-by-frame but computationally efficient approach for video object segmentation by clustering visually similar generic object segments throughout the video. Our algorithm segments various object instances appearing in the video and then perform clustering in order to group visually similar segments into one cluster. Since the object that needs to be segmented appears in most part of the video, we can retrieve the foreground segments from the cluster having maximum number of segments, thus filtering out noisy segments that do not represent any object. We then apply a track and fill approach in order to localize the objects in the frames where the object segmentation framework fails to segment any object. Our algorithm performs comparably to the recent automatic methods for video object segmentation when benchmarked on DAVIS dataset while being computationally much faster."

For many distributions it is possible to create low-variance gradient estimators by utilizing a `reparameterization trick'. Due to the absence of a general reparameterization trick, much research has recently been devoted to extend the number of reparameterizable distributional families. Unfortunately, this research has primarily focused on distributions defined in Euclidean space, ruling out the usage of one of the most influential class of spaces with non-trivial topologies: Lie groups. In this work we define a general framework to create reparameterizable densities on arbitrary Lie groups, and provide a detailed practitioners guide to further the ease of usage. We demonstrate how to create complex and multimodal distributions on the well known oriented group of 3D rotations, $\operatorname{SO}(3)$, using normalizing flows. Our experiments on applying such distributions in a Bayesian setting for pose estimation on objects with discrete and continuous symmetries, showcase their necessity in achieving realistic uncertainty estimates."

Since most patients cannot precisely describe their symptoms, dialogue understanding is challenging for MDS. Previous studies mainly addressed this by extracting the mentioned medical entities as critical dialogue history information. In this work, we argue that it is also essential to capture the transitions of the medical entities and the doctor's dialogue acts in each turn, as they help the understanding of how the dialogue flows and enhance the prediction of the entities and dialogue acts to be adopted in the following turn. Correspondingly, we propose a Dual Flow enhanced Medical (DFMed) dialogue generation framework. It extracts the medical entities and dialogue acts used in the dialogue history and models their transitions with an entity-centric graph flow and a sequential act flow, respectively. We employ two sequential models to encode them and devise an interweaving component to enhance their interactions. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our method exceeds baselines in both automatic and manual evaluations."
990,aaai,2021,Safe Search for Stackelberg Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i6.16697,"Stackelberg equilibrium is a solution concept in two-player games where the leader has commitment rights over the follower. In recent years, it has become a cornerstone of many security applications, including airport patrolling and wildlife poaching prevention. Even though many of these settings are sequential in nature, existing techniques pre-compute the entire solution ahead of time. In this paper, we present a theoretically sound and empirically effective way to apply search, which leverages extra online computation to improve a solution, to the computation of Stackelberg equilibria in general-sum games. Instead of the leader attempting to solve the full game upfront, an approximate ""blueprint"" solution is first computed offline and is then improved online for the particular subgames encountered in actual play. We prove that our search technique is guaranteed to perform no worse than the pre-computed blueprint strategy, and empirically demonstrate that it enables approximately solving significantly larger games compared to purely offline methods. We also show that our search operation may be cast as a smaller Stackelberg problem, making our method complementary to existing algorithms based on strategy generation."

Given a construction layout, we propose a visual context-aware graph generation network that learns the implicit global relations among the scene components and infers the location of a new building unit. The proposed network takes as input the scene graph and the corresponding top-view depth image. It provides the location recommendations for a newly-added building units by learning an auto-regressive edge distribution conditioned on existing scenes. We also introduce a global graph-image matching loss to enhance the awareness of essential geometry semantics of the site. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the recommended location well reflects the implicit spatial rules of components in the residential estates, and it is instructive and practical to locate the building units in the 3D scene of the complex construction."

Existing privacy-preserving federated learning approaches are mostly tailored for image data, lacking applications for time series data, which have many important applications, like machine health monitoring, human activity recognition, etc. Furthermore, protective noising on a time series data analytics model can significantly interfere with temporal-dependent learning, leading to a greater decline in accuracy. To address these issues, we develop a privacy-preserving federated learning algorithm for time series data. Specifically, we employ local differential privacy to extend the privacy protection trust boundary to the clients. We also incorporate shuffle techniques to achieve a privacy amplification, mitigating the accuracy decline caused by leveraging local differential privacy. Extensive experiments were conducted on five time series datasets. The evaluation results reveal that our algorithm experienced minimal accuracy loss compared to non-private federated learning in both small and large client scenarios. Under the same level of privacy protection, our algorithm demonstrated improved accuracy compared to the centralized differentially private federated learning in both scenarios."

We examine the performance of node embedding algorithms with respect to graph centrality measures that characterize diverse graphs, through systematic experiments with four node embedding algorithms, four or five graph centralities, and six datasets. Experimental results give insights into the properties of node embedding algorithms, which can be a basis for further research on this topic."

More specifically, we are given a matroid $\mathcal{M}=(E,\mathcal{I})$ where each ground (indivisible) element is a selfish agent. The cost of each element (i.e., for selling the item or performing a service) is only known to the element itself. There is a buyer with a budget having additive valuations over the set of elements $E$. The goal is to design an incentive compatible (truthful) budget feasible mechanism which procures an independent set of the matroid under the given budget that yields the largest value possible to the buyer. Our result is a deterministic, polynomial-time, individually rational, truthful and budget feasible mechanism with $4$-approximation to the optimal independent set. Then, we extend our mechanism to the setting of matroid intersections in which the goal is to procure common independent sets from multiple matroids. We show that, given a polynomial time deterministic blackbox that returns $\alpha-$approximation solutions to the matroid intersection problem, there exists a deterministic, polynomial time, individually rational, truthful and budget feasible mechanism with $(3\alpha +1)-$approximation to the optimal common independent set."

We frame NESC as a binary classification problem and we use NER as well as recurrent neural networks to find the probability of candidate named entity is a real named entity. We apply this approach to Tweet texts and we show how we could find named entities with high confidence levels from Tweets."

Unlike open-domain dialogue generation, this requires background knowledge specific to the medical domain. Existing generative frameworks for medical dialogue generation fall short of incorporating domain-specific knowledge, especially with regard to medical terminology. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to improve medical dialogue generation by considering features centered on domain-specific terminology. We leverage an attention mechanism to incorporate terminologically centred features, and fill in the semantic gap between medical background knowledge and common utterances by enforcing language models to learn terminology representations with an auxiliary terminology recognition task. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, in which our proposed framework outperforms SOTA language models. Additionally, we provide a new dataset with medical terminology annotations to support the research on medical dialogue generation.

As a preliminary model for circulating tumor cells in blood, we automatically classified primary and metastatic colon cancer cells, where the two types of cancer cells were isolated from the same individual, as well as four types of blood cells. We used low-coherence off-axis interferometric phase microscopy and a microfluidic channel to quantitatively image cells during flow. The acquired images were processed and classified based on their morphology and quantitative phase features during the cell flow. We achieved high accuracy of 92.56 percent for distinguishing between the cells, paving the way for future automatic label-free cancer cell classification in blood samples."

In this way, the dependence on a large number of target domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning researches, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey paper reviews more than forty representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over twenty representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different datasets, i.e., Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31.

In multi-event sentences, it requires understanding the relationships between events based on contextual knowledge. We propose COMET-M (Multi-Event), an event-centric commonsense model capable of generating commonsense inferences for a target event within a complex sentence. COMET-M builds upon COMET (Bosselut et al., 2019), which excels at generating event-centric inferences for simple sentences, but struggles with the complexity of multi-event sentences prevalent in natural text. To overcome this limitation, we curate a multi-event inference dataset of 35K human-written inferences. We trained COMET-M on the human-written inferences and also created baselines using automatically labeled examples. Experimental results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of COMET-M over COMET in generating multi-event inferences. Moreover, COMET-M successfully produces distinct inferences for each target event, taking the complete context into consideration. COMET-M holds promise for downstream tasks involving natural text such as coreference resolution, dialogue, and story understanding."

There remain open questions on what objective we should optimize to represent business values in the long term best, and how we should balance between daily metrics and resource consumption in a dynamically fluctuating environment. We propose a personalized methodology for the frequency control problem, which combines long-term value optimization using reinforcement learning (RL) with a robust volume control technique we termed ""Effective Factor"". We demonstrate statistically significant improvement in daily metrics and resource efficiency by our method in several notification applications at a scale of billions of users. To our best knowledge, our study represents the first deep RL application on the frequency control problem at such an industrial scale."
